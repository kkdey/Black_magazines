black theatergo home if a new black theater is to be born sustain itself and justify its own being it must go home go home psychically mentally esthetically and i think physically now what does all that mean first off what do i myself mean by a new black theater i mean the ritualized reflection and projection of a unique and particular way of being bom of the unique and particular conditioning of black people leasing time on this planet controlled by whitemen and having something to do with the breaking of that leasingsyndrome a theater emerging from artists who realize that for black people of this world and specifically this country every quote universal human malady dilemma desire or wonder is by the heat of the pressure of whiteracism compounded and enlarged agitated and aggravated accented and distilled to make that omnisuffusing grinding sense of being we once called the blues but might now just term blackness from this peculiar and particular extradimension of being of experiences of conditioning will come the kind of theater im looking for out of the fact that something as universal as the innerdrive and desire for success takes on a different shade another prickpoint when it is beneath a black skin there are some strange bilevel goals some other further obstacle considerations involved out of the fact that even love vibrates to these ultraearthy subterranean accents love for family for woman for friend for self are all touched somehow somewhere by this infrashadow and it is from this deep shadow that will come this new theater i am seeing come in many brilliant new forms of enlightenment illumination it will be a theater having to do with love of ones self and ones personal national and international family with wariness and hatred of ones personal national and international enemies with ideally points as to how to break their grip and splatter their power now let me stay right in here a minute i want to make sure i get across at least some hint of all the levels i see here try a couple more parables examples similies or whatever allright so lets take the french film black orpheus a sweet bright touching thing just good to see a woman like that in full color but to make it afroamerican orpheus there would have to be some extending and deepening of dimensions understand me a writer in the new black theater might want to make the hell the death the girls going into the whiteworld rejecting not only orpheus but all other cats and things black that would be the hell and orpheus going to get her back with just courage and con and a song would really be some thing wouldnt it and how could he not look back at the past at the promises of the devil yeh deep stuff tragic and neither shaw oneill nor any of those other great ones could write it not within this level of blackness im talking about i can almost feel some of you thinking racism pure racism well i dont know now all the universal implications messages of the tale are still there what this imaginary writer has done is to put hell up on earth where it belongs and say that it has something to do with rejecting your own people and images for other people and images and if there is racism in it it only makes it more validly of this time and of this world your fire driving others fires out of your brain now that little adaptation points at just one level of what im visualizing but there will be so many other levels coming simultaneously levels of love and joy and strength and courage like how did bighearted bigbellied george jones this elevatoroperator pullmanporter foundryflunky keep that deep clean laughter goingraise all those kids and keep that strong groovy woman swept all those years on it how did he do it how come everybody in the barbershop poolroom workhouse and everywhere is glad to see him coming turning to him to warm their psychic and spiritual hands how why who what cant you see him in a bluelight sitting up on the side of the bed plotting next weeks billdodging and billpaying with all of them asleep except maybe her lying there touching his back now and then telling him to get some rest but in the morning with still no answers in sight hes got the right glowing laugh of confidence to send those kids on out ready to run through those prejudice teachers and all that other crapto look for something he never saw now how does he do that he knows whats happening hes been through a thousand hunky overseers on a thousand poisonous jobs hes had to dodge and stall the buzzards so long he can smell em a month away now how hes some huge terrific soul stretching his lowceilinged cage all out of shapedefeating it even while it kills him a peculiar and particularly tragichero made both tragic and heroic by his way with a particularly peculiar poisonous situation getting george jones and that deep resilient lady of his and their indigo moments on stage is being in another level of the new black theater so many levels all levels because there is no personal style or hangup or revelation that cant be worked out within and through the stances and situations of black people through the questions and answers in the rightnow relevance frequency we must tune ourselves and our audiences into in order to nurture race self and art a writer coming this way won t lack in his work any of those universal everyone screams about not if he has any in him if you look for em youll find em even in the comic strips but he will become involved in the projection of a certain uniqueness that is his hardearned birthright now any of you who know about writing or about speechmaking probably realized that that was the return of the bridge back there that stanza ending in that riff ofrace self art that brings me back to where i started where said that if this theater is to be it mustpsychically mentally esthetically and i feel even physicallygo home im sure you know now what i mean by going home psychically and mentally but just in case let me try to run a short quick summary by psychically i mean coming away from your duespaying to all those outside influences and going into the real black you by way of those places people and experiences which began and had the most to do with the shaping of what is now yourselfmean making works theater out of that and in doing it extending and validating that particular psychic by mentally i mean understanding that you and the experiences of you are in time and history collective repet tons have been repeated and multiplied many times so as artists you are to try to find the terms and the pictures which will most simply clarify those experiences and that knowledge for the yous who do not or could not understand what is or was happening to you and to future yous who will need to be warned and directed in terms from inside that level we call blacknessfor it is within that level that most of the added making or breaking weight comes going home esthetically will follow naturallv after those first two m stepssince your esthetics come out of your mental and psychic environment so i wont eo into the demand for new dynamics for a new intensity of language and form that the material and the desired atmosphere will make on you except to say that the further you go home the more startlingly new and black the techniques become musicians are pointing that out to us now going home physically with the new theater means just that probably i should have started here for this new theater must be housed in sustained and a judged by and be a useable projection of and to a black community the community itself will be the theater and the black artists house of drama like a weirdly fixed and pointed lookingglass a lightprism casting warnings directions fruitful memories and marvelous imaginings on the walls of the doomed or soon to be recreated buildings right there in the community are your materials your situations and conflictsrelevant and powerful when you stand on those streets feeling the human whimpering going on under the beasts muzzle when the myriad poisons are part of your natural everyday elements the needs will either come bursting out of your pens onto your stages or theyll drive you sick with your own faggot cowardice the need to displace and replace pale and dark villains and heroes ideas and concepts images and symbols the need for defined and dramatized hugelydrawn clearly shown walking and talking details as to how to organize community county nation world for a shattering attack against the most voracious powermachine the world has ever known details not stunning poetic generalities details details should be moving around those stages in all kinds of explicit images huffing and puffing and working themselves out of the killing situationsor showing why they cannot pictures of who and what was the past how it was called and who answered and why it all went down who were those heroes the kids have got to know of and believe in before they can believe that you or any other black man has anything to tell them what were the betrayals how does judas look when hes black detailed pictures of who and what is doing the killing now and how itawesome as it might seem can be maneuvered into deathtraps all the while youre singing about that woman that buddy those personal artpromises you made to yourself all and any of it placed right in the context in which you found it and from which you can only free it through direct confrontation that is americas ballcutting racist vise youve grabbed every piece of beauty thought insight and style youve ever achieved in your life while dodging that crap and to put it out of your work before it is out of your life is making a lie of your artwhich is nothing but your life thoughts feelings seeings imaginings doings sent out to others with an imposed reorder you will never have a theater an art a life really representative of the soulbeats and desirelines of you and your kind until you and your kind have come together and pooled desires plans resources and capabilities to throw olf the jailers the people the communities are trapped in both unconscious suicide and subtle dedicated genocide you have a tool that might be able to help whatre you going to do go out on a bridge halfway between realities and blow to yourself or serenade the downtown people and catch the pennies they throw at your feet i hope not speaking of penniesand we have tothere is also a definite practical economical reason for the new theater going physically to the black communities that is that broadway doesnt want your blackness wasnt designed or intended for it definitely doesnt want any strange new forms inspired by that very blackness she is a contented fat white cow if you can slip in and milk her for a minutewell then more blackpower to you brother but im telling youits a weird price shes asking she wants you to be a singing hyena dancing on the graves of yourself and everyone you know serious things dramas are things that come from some other country some other century and even then are best set in a madhouse and quote blackcomedy has nothing to do with afroamericans broadway cannot support you brothers and sisters it would be against their interests if youre thinking that offbroadway is a haven think again it is finally as a perfect example of what america would have its artists involved in a zoo with a carnival where the animals and the freaks play delightfully curiously shockingly with lights colors words forms gestures always with some ingrown aspect of themselves never with anything in the outerworld should any relevance be uttered or implied it is usually done so with the utmost obscurity now and again i have to admit something disturbs that tranquil scene down there something real and relevantrelated to other peoples livesseeps in then everyone does a doubletake and goes back wondering if maybe something could really be starting down there after all but its usually just something or someone healthy getting ready to breakout of there nothing to be alarmed about wont happen often to round off my thinking on offbroadway i tell you that art for arts sake is incest and the offsprings of that are usually strange and feeble we black people desperately need a healthy natural artform art coming from an intercourse with life our lives as we have and must live them in order for our art theater to provide this for us it must become an organic functioning part of our communities as black artists we must go home in every way go wherever it is we most feel indigenous and organic and therefore a natural observer and commentor it is there that our talents must pay dues and spend dividends the communities the people can sustain assist and inspire us to essential and brilliant levels in our new black theater our new visions but only if we assist and inspire them to the same levels in the new black theater of their living to new visions of their lives nearly everyone knows the story of old sam sam came out of harlem and he worked on the same job for years he was a hard worker but he always took mondays off one day the boss told him sam you are the best worker i have but why cant you get to work on mondays sam answered boss if you could get colored on friday nights and have as much fun as we do you couldnt get to work on mondays either now all of this is amusing but there is something to be noted here sam was in the same place where he was years ago and in looking around at the position of the black man in the theater i am wondering if he isnt in the same place he has been in for years and like sam he may be having fun on weekends but he is being insidiously destroyed it takes no genius to realize that a theater is as strong as its playwrights there has never been a truly great theater without playwrights the greeks had sophocles and aeschylus the british had shakespeare the french had moliere and the irish had synge and ocasey and the american theater of the s had oneill barry and sidney howard black people had fun sometimes i suspect that black people have had too much fun they have run their mouths while white folks were organizing no one has had the nerve to say it out loud but i suspect very strongly that one of the reasons the great african civilizations fell was because their intellectuals did more talking than writing and the children of those great civilizations continue to talk at any rate the realization that any theater needs playwrights led to my joining the late great actress rose mcclendon in organizing the negro peoples theater in two years later after miss mcclendons death my late wife muriel rahn joined me in establishing the rose mcclendon players we drew around us such talented people as ossie davis jane white ed cambridge austin briggshall frederick oneal dooley wilson canada lee george norford eugene grigsby fred carter and loften mitchell we initiated a policy of doing only plays written by black playwrights and we did pretty well five years were poured into our activities in the basement of the mt morris park library at west street we produced fifteen plays some oneactors some fulllength some were better than others but at least three showed truly great promise on the part of their authors unfortunately those three authors long ago ceased to write plays they became press agents reporters and school teachers for they had to eat and no one was buying a black playwrights work in those daysunless he turned out a green pastures harlem or some such trivia that appealed to broadways white theatergoers no one is buying black playwrights work today eitherincluding black producers indeed a curious thing has happened this past year while people sang of the negro theatergroundswell exactly one black american ronald milner saw his play produced in new york city the nowdestroyed new lafayette theater produced mr milners whos got his own black producers are outmarshaling the marshal plan they have produced the work of a european and now theyre going to australia and africato any place but home to put it bluntly black producers are allies of the power structure in terms of keeping black people in their customary roles namely court jesters in the american drama it seems that neither white nor black america wants to deal with the realities of the black experience on this continent frankly i began to worry when i saw those foundations giving out huge chunks of money i said then that those who got the money were going into a lot of mental gymnastics over how to keep black playwrights off the boards i kicked myself told myself i was getting old and that those fellows would produce plays by black americans well i am sorry that i was right in the first place someone wrote recently that the negro theater is a sometime thing it is and it will ever be thus unless somebody writes for it there are highsounding motives and mottoes around today indicating that black people are making their way in the theatertheir own way the new york times recently devoted nearly a full page of its sunday theater section to the pronouncements of douglas turner ward author of the fine longrunning double bill day of absence and happy ending at the st marks playhouse which is now the home of the newly founded and funded negro ensemble company any day you can pick up a daily and find a lengthy piece on the life and times of the negro theater these pronouncements all say pretty much the same thing that the afroamerican theater needs special playsplays that communicate to a special audience the black audience the premise is that it takes a black american to really write for the black american theater douglas turner ward said as much in his new york times interview some months ago to stanley kaufman former times theater critic obviously the ford foundation has no objections to this premise since it gave to mr ward and his partner actorproducer robert hooks nearly to form a negro ensemble company where black actors could be trained and molded into an ensemble theater group all of this is very good but i have a feeling that afroamerican playwrights should be working right along with actors directors and others in the group and i dont mean student actors and directors exclusively i mean professional afroamerican playwrights to write material for the professional actors in the company much is happening to black people everywhere today where are the playwrights to get some of this downthis black comedy or dramaand on our stages now what any novice in theater knows is that not all playwrights start out writing hits more often he misses before he hits but what is important is the opportunity to develop his craft right along with the actor if nobody ever presents his works he will never know his weaknesses he has to see his creations and find out for himself where he made mistakes he must go through the same trialanderror method which makes the actor outstanding in the process therefore of developing an afroamerican or negro ensemble company whose basics are not only communication with the black audience but communicating blackness to a white audience it is difficult to understand why black playwrights are not carried along in the overall development of the negro ensemble company true mr ward is a prolific writer and a solid pro but the scheduled plays for the negro ensemble companys first season suggests that mr ward and mr hooks are not only fresh out of plays but that they are fresh out of playwrights in the latter case this just isnt so the negro ensemble company has adapted ray lawlors summer of the seventeenth doll which had a fairtomiddling broadway run a few years ago to a negro locale on the levee gracious me this harks back to the thirties and forties of the hot mikado carmen jones and my dartin aida only now the nec is substituting legitimate plays for musicals after years of watching and participating in this kind of thing to earn a living i am not only disappointed in mr ward and mr hooks i am shocked no i am disgusted why anyone would think these gentlemen are a couple of starving black actors without a theater to their names hustling next weeks rent but that just isnt so these two guys are rich man theyve got nearly half a million bucks of the mans money and when thats gone im sure the man will be back with more well cry discrimination if he doesnt after all its popular to give black folks money these days its chic compounding the insult is the injury i endured by watching song of the lusitanian bogey by peter weiss who needs the nec to do his plays like he needs a hole in the head mr weiss whose marat sade and the investigation were weirdly successful after a fashion will probably come through in his usual style and please the critics this wont help negro playwrights and the announced daddy goodnessof which i know nothing will probably give black playwrights a chance to see what richard wright might have accomplished as a playwright had he lived of course mr wright didnt write daddy goodness he merely translated and adapted it why does the nec select these plays to do when there are many afroamerican playwrights walking around with pretty good scripts under their arms looking for producers i can think of at least four offhand in whom the nec could invest as playwrightsinresidence have a season of four plays that would say something to black and white people but especially to black people i shall name them without their permission they are alice childress who had a fine offbroadway play at the greenwich mews theatre some seasons back entitled trouble in mind loften mitchell who has just written the greatest book on the negro theatre ever published black drama and who had an excellent play at the greenwich mews a few seasons back entitled a land beyond the river ossie davis whose purlie victorious not only had a broadway run but was also made into a movie neither of which made him rich because of his content and william branch whose a wreath for udomo is a classic and telling statement of an african dictators downfall based on a novel by the noted african author peter abrahams all of these men and this woman have had successes but with no foundations to keep them flush mitchell and branch did receive guggenheim awards of each some years back and they came up with good works now that the nec has made its first big mistake i hope a second season will afford it an opportunity to go about the business of doing what it should have been doing from the very first nec does have the work of the noted african playwright wole soyinka on its schedule but i think it is ironic that the group had to look to european australian and african sources it is indeed so ironic that years later old sam and i remain in the same spot taking mondays off sam doesnt know it but i think i do while were having fun on those weekends the american power structure is taking care of business and its business is to see that we black people stay in the same place for another years black people are rapidly learning that they must define their own terms how terms are defined determines how events are judged and how questions are answered for instance in catholic schools the religious upheavals initiated by martin luthers dispute with the pope are called the protestant revolution whereas in public schools the same series of events are called the protestant reformation the term which you accept determines how you feel about the events discussed a term much in vogue for discussion nowadays is black theater there is a general agreement that there is a definite need for a strong and viable black theater in this country and as a result groups have been springing up through the country the recentlylaunched new yorkbased negro ensemble company is one group which lays claim to filling the void existing in the black theater world financed with a oneyear grant from the ultraestablishmentarian ford foundation the company has already completed one of the four plays which are scheduled for its first season at the time this is written the play song of the lusitanian bogey by german playwright peter weiss received generally favorable reviews from the press and many people hailed this as new black theater but to many interested persons the question remains is the negro ensemble company really black theater can a theater group financed by the ford foundation produce black theater in his recently published book crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruse provides a definition of black theater which most black people find acceptable my own standards for a black theater would be one where negroes themselves would finance the institution and man all the technical and administrative posts using this definition as a guideline the answer would have to be notrue black theater cannot be financed by this countrys ford foundations all critics of the company dont agree completely with mr cruses position of course they are not critical of the company for the acceptance of the grant but for the way it is being used by douglas turner ward the artistic director and robert hooks the executive director of the ensemble company actordirector ernie mcclintock says they have the money ford cant take it back the worst they can do is not renew it they could have used the oneyear grace to really experiment and give exposure to young black playwrights instead they are using all wellestablished playwrights who really dont need the exposure critics are especially incensed over the selection of plays for their first season besides weiss play which depicts the horrors of portuguese colonialism in africa the company is doing summer of the seventeenth doll by australian playwright ray lawler which has been transposed from its original australian setting to the world of migratory black sugar cane workers in louisiana the third play is kongis harvest the latest by nigerian playwright wole soyinka which deals with the corruption in i an african dictatorship and the final work is daddy goodness a richard wright adaptation of an original french play by louis sapin this play has to do with peoples need for a kind of messiah and the ways in which this need can be exploited critics feel that there is no excuse for the companys not scheduling one play by a black american playwright based on a black american theme ward answers these criticisms with the explanation that the companys objective is to promote plays which have a relevance to black life whether written by black or white american or foreign playwrights he contends that the selected plays fulfill that aim technically he is correct but the question still remains why does a group which lists as one of its aims a desire to provide a new platform for the exposure of the works of young black actors and playwrights not have one play by a young black playwright in its opening season the explanation that the directors of the company looked but couldnt find a suitable play is met with skepticism in the black artistic community a second bone of contention between the negro ensemble company and many of its potential supporters is its location in the east village rather than in one of the black communities especially since ward himself has been quoted as saying that for a negro playwright the need is for an audience of other negroes in his new york times article american theatre for whites only ward wrote of the need for a theater of permanence continuity and consistency providing the necessary homebase for the negro artist to launch a campaign to win his ignored brothers and sisters as constant witnesses to his endeavors he also wrote that the black playwright needed not necessarily an allblack audience to the exclusion of white but for the playwright a black audience is certainly his primary audience the first persons of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his interest and purpose be best perceived by others it would seem to follow that a playwright expressing such sentiments would locate his theater in one of the large black communities where the type of audiences which he described is readily available ward didnt do so and his reasoning is that were not here on the lower east side because its the lower east side were here because we got a threestory building complete with theater that fulfills our needs moreover we can be reached by negroes from all over the metropolitan area not just harlem bedfordstuyvesant is only minutes away and jersey city minutes we want to build a black audience throughout the area he also feels that black people will come to the st marks playhouse to see good relevant theater using the success of his oneact plays day of absence and happy ending in attracting an almost per cent black audience people as a case in point these statements hardly quiet his critics who wonder how many black people would attend the theatre if it was located in their community and they could just walk in from the streets pay their money and see good relevant theater the question remains can the term black theater be used to define a theater located outside the black community the negro ensemble company says yes its critics say no the companys use of whites in key positions has also brought it under fire from important segments of the black community gerald krone is administrative director paul mann is director of training for the professional company alfred geller is legal counsel and joseph m gottfried is accountant these are some of the whites who hold positions which many feel should have beenand could have beenheld by blacks the critics are especially soured by manns appointment as director of professional training feeling that this very sensitive post must be filled by a black director if the theater is directed towards a black audience wards reply to this line of criticism is that ive been a negro militant for years and i share their anger i also have my own ideas about practicality and they do not eliminate the use of any talent to fulfill any other talent well said but is he talking about black theater the negro ensemble company despite its claims is not black theater it may be interesting theater it may be good theater but to call it black theater would be considerably stretching the definition of black theater given by harold cruse a definition which i accept there is no consistent philosophy of cultural nationalism directing the actions of its leaders douglas turner ward and robert hooks who themselves are not known as cultural nationalists they are very talented and even their critics had little criticism of the caliber of the professional acting company about which it is generally agreed that the performances in bogey were excellent and in a highly professional ensemble style but those of us who are looking for a black theater will have to look elsewhere right into the black communities realizing that if we want true black theater we will have to pay for it and sustain it by our resources and skills recently i received in the mail a big fat bulky questionnaire from the committee on human rights concerning discrimination in the theater now that was bad enough but a few evenings later i went bouncing out of my apartment as i do every saturday night or early sunday morning to purchase the new york times hurried back to quickly glance through the newsy theater section and the intellectual magazine section to find out if there was anything interesting enough to read i could then determine whether i would stay in and relax or go to the movies i had just given up on the drama section i briskly began thumbing through the magazine section when what to my wandering eyes should appear but a big fat juicy article about us oh boy oh boy what a pleasant surprise out the window goes all plans for the movies i pour me a glass of milk take out cookies and make myself comfortable so i can really relax and enjoy what mr kerr has to say about us poor neglected problem children the negro actor well its about time i say but the more i read the less comfortable i become and the more i read the less cozy my apartment becomes and the more i read the more sour my milk becomes and the more rancid my cookies seem to taste until finally i scream being the method actress that i am stop stop stop oh please stop i cant take any more of this meaningless chitchat this wasted misdirected energy first the questionnaire and now this article that did it its just too too much for one week i mean really the white establishment is making it impossible for us to stay sane after the emotional outburst the irony of the whole ridiculous situation hit me and i simply plopped down in my not so cozy chair and laughed now by the time i had finished going through all my emotional changes the last feature of the movie had begun and there i was stuck at home with my article on one side and my questionnaire on the other what to do what to do what to dothe outlook is incurably blue in case you are curious as to the contents of my big fat bulky questionnaire and after all you are entitled to know what caused the initial discomfort it goes like this dear actor the enclosed questionnaire is confidential and is aimed towards determining what kind of employment situation exists for actors with racial andor ethnic minority backgrounds in order to explore conditions relating to the work experience of the professional actor and to find out if the hiring policies of theatrical employers are changing and what the rate of that change is we must have your cooperation in gathering information that will give us facts please read the questionnaire over carefully bear in mind that its purpose is to determine is there an employment problem in the theatrical field broadway offbroadway television motion pictures television commercials and industrials for qualified negro puerto rican japanese chinese indian etc actors need i go any further now i ask you is this questionnaire really necessary all one has to do is turn on the television go to any neighborhood movie or buy a ticket to any broadway play and the answers are readily available without the need for any questionnaire after all this time centuries and i do mean centuries how can whites still be naive enough to think that the racial inequalities of show business and on a larger scale of this country can be solved by writing still more articles essays questionnairesand even bookson the problem of the negro in america come now who are we kidding at this point in our history there are certainly enough books and periodicals both for and against integration most of which in their own individual styles clearly define the racial problems in america books which precisely state why all this happened how it happened why it continues to go on and even solutions to the problem and if one refuses to read books on this touchy subject one has the alternative of taking a trip that is those who are brave enough to any ghetto in any city of this country and see for yourself actually for all the friends of black people who constantly ask what do you want or in some cases if they are ultrasophisticated what do they want or why do they hate us so it wouldnt be a bad idea to sponsor guided tours once or twice a day through each harlem of this country heavily protected of course and if it accomplishes nothing else at least we might be able to eliminate those stupid questions my point is simply this there is no excuse any more for this childlike naivete concerning the racial issues in this country and on a more specific level in the theater black writers have more than done their share toward providing enlightenment if they would all leave their typewriters and not write another sentence for another decade there would still be enough material to read and digest the white american has proven himself over the vears to be the m most cunning calculating shrewd and contriving human ever created he spend hours upon hours every day mastering the ability to maintain andor gain power and will go to any lengths to achieve this power so how can he expect me to believe that the same mastermind who created the hydrogen bombs and send missiles into outer space this same brilliant mind cannot understand the simple issues involved in eradicating racial inequalities this shrewd mind instead expends vital creative energy trying to throw america offtrack by sending out banal questionnaires and writing juvenile articles concerning the negro question how mr kerr one of americas most outstanding theater critics could reach his conclusions in his article in the new york times magazine am a negro or am i an actor is absolutely mystifying to me does he really think after all this time actors are dumb enough to interpret this concern to mean he really wants to do something positive to eliminate the condition tm afraid not instead the article will be read and people will say isnt that a shame and again life will go on actually on the surface the article seemed intelligent terribly honest and extremely courageous it would appear that he has tremendous insight concerning the dilemma confronting black people in the american theater today he asked many legitimate questions which showed a total awareness of the existing situation however in the process of answering those very questions thereby arriving at definite conclusions and proposing definite solutions he left the negro actor either totally confused bewildered or completely disappointed relative to what he must do about increasing his employment opportunities on broadway lets look at the situation closely as stated up to this date integration has been the black actors total concern on broadway in order to provide more jobs for himself in the already established field of entertainment he has picketed satin marched and negotiated new laws this still has not helped him to accomplish his goals because he now finds himself in a position where he must turn down many of these very jobs so it would seem the problem is far more complex than simply hiring more negro actors now the question is what type of jobs can heor should heaccept perhaps the answer to this question should be as long as the white establishment is in complete control as long as it determines the interpretation of the roles as long as they dictate to us what the behavior of the character must be as long as they reap the majority of the material profit the black actor accepting roles in such vehicles will only help maintain the status quo andor in some cases even retard his already established position why when white people determine what image black people should reflect on stage they usually perpetuate out of ignorance antiquated cliches these writers and directors generally have no real knowledge of the true history and psyche of black people and therefore their creativeor historical choices of what the black actor is suppose to represent are inaccurate or unreal the black actor is therefore being used as a pawn for the whites own personal gain this is particularly true in musicals where we are most blatantly exploited always singing dancing carefree happygolucky got no worries got no cares creatures since contrary to what mr kerr says the theater does play a major role in setting standards and values the black artist who continues to accept these type roles will justify and also enablewhite writers to continue to write them and white producers to continue to make money from them and can you blame them and white audiences will continue to carry a distorted image back home with them as long as this prevails there will be no next step forward if producers writers anddirectors intentions were honorable when dealing with black material on or offbroadway they would at least solicit the services of black consultants andor assistant directors they would hire black personnel on an administrative or policymaking level and please dont raise the issue of qualifications today there exist many victims of the theater s fear of hiring qualified black personnel i am one such victim as one big producer said to another what is she going to be some kind of black thermostat it seems no one is willing to share his control even if it would mean a better more accurate production examples hallelujah baby on broadway and all regional and repertory theater companies lincoln center included how can there be progress as long as every decision made and every job obtained in the theater is from a white point of view and must be accepted on white terms no matter how big a black actor may become his image is still fixed lockedin and he is constantly used as some kind of oddity or bastard commodity as a black actress as long as this condition prevails i can merely look forward to playing demanding roles such as prostitute maid andor every now and then just for local color of course some form of exotic perhaps a role in one of the classics however if im really lucky and can survive the frustrations of this business when im old and gray i can look forward to playing a strong forceful ballcutting matriarch and the white theater will continue to profit from my unique negritude at least i will be secure in specifically knowing the types and roles i will or will not be allowed to play i will not be allowed to grow from an ingenue into a leading lady into a character actress heavens no thats for white folks only i will rather grow from a hard cold prostitute into a hard cold matriarch only two dimensions its really amazing to what lengths playwrights and directors go to in order to make their black characters fit the stereotype one could never imagine a black actress playing a woman or even a lady who is eitheror warm wise sensitive intelligent loving puritanical helpless longsuffering confused or perhaps a fickle human being consciously or unconsciously really its irrelevant white people have convinced themselves and as always when they convince themselves they usually convince most blacks too that being black of necessity narrows ones scope therefore being black means being limited its like putting on some form of strait jacket its some kind of freakish quality which in all theatrical cases necessitates that you be handicapped a basket case and it seems that as long as black performers are hired to entertain white america their creative talents will be dealt with in this extremely limited fashion actually all that being black means is that one has a specific frame of reference or point of view just as any white american russian irish english jewish greek spanish chinese or any other race of people have and isnt that where all creative experiences begin from a specific ethnic or environmental base blackness is something within not something without therefore being black merely gives the artist a specific base or starting point whereby he may relate his life experiences to an audience in his own unique life style to quote mr kerr we live in a time of theatrical naturalism for approximately years our plays have become more and more photographic more literally faithful to the details and appearance of life as it is lived statistically settings must look exactly as houses and apartments look behavior in the theater must duplicate precisely behavior outside the theater whether we call this realism or naturalism doesnt matter what matters is that we now expect to hear and see in the theater a close duplication of what we see and hear in our homes in our offices on our sidewalks whites do not see many negroes in their homes nor do negroes see whites in theirs not socially not as young brides not as reallife leading ladies whites do not see many negroes in their offices at least not after they have passed the reception desks general experience knows no casual interchange to place such a casual interchange upon the stage as though it were real when we know it is not iswithin naturalismto falsify nature the image doesnt persuade it kicks back therefore one can reach the conclusion that white audiences will not support an integrated play or an allnegro play which does not coincide with their way of life their way of thinking but the fact of the matter is that the united states is a mixed society it isnt a white society its a whiteandblack society this we can also both agree on now please let us not confuse the discomforts caused by sexual involvements with those of socalled casual interchange one has nothing to do with the other and perhaps we should leave the bedroom alone and begin thinking and using our energies toward developing a dialogue between blacks and whites which will enable us to have a more realistic picture as to how and where we do exist and how this knowledge can be used in the theater in essence anyone who doesnt come in at least casual contact with a black these days is an exception rather than the rule and he should immediately do something about his plight perhaps mr kerr was referring to people who occupy the orchestra seats on broadway they cause broadway to be as sterile and superficial as it is perhaps if broadway were geared toward the people we could have more realistic and meaingful theater this then seems to be the reason theater is in the predicament it is today broadway sticks to the status quo in order to appease these orchestra seaters with their rigid fantasized ethics perhaps this whole system of theater should be destroyed because in having to conform to this oversentimental highly romanticized view of life it is killing the artist this decadent sense of morality that insists on the clean proper and pure that refuses to face life directly and honestlyperhaps this very fear of truth is killing the american theater in the past the standards of achievement and excellence have been set by broadway and because of these rigid rules regulations prejudices and narrowminded concepts the state of the theater today is boring and depressing broadway with its machinelike precision has become the equivalent of a xerox machine it is a place where stage hands and technicians are treated with more deference than actors would the theater be in this position if it dared to deal with life as painful as it may be as it really exists this would include dealing with all its religious moral political and racial conflicts nowadays black and white writers who are striving to reach broadway audiences must be limited by this factor a writer should not be fenced in he should be able to direct his creative energy toward what he believes to be true he should be free to interpret life fully as he sees it and as all great playwrights before him have dealt with it he should not be forced to speak from two sides of his mouth the money side dont rock the boat please the orchestra and the true side and because of these same dominant values more often than not the negro actor sacrifices his ethnic heritage in order to become more salable ie commercial if he becomes more commercial it therefore follows he becomes more white can he actually merge and identify at the same time the black actor is the beneficiary of a rich cultural heritage and the day has got to come when he will be allowed to expose this image on every stage in the american theater in order to accomplish this he must constantly think of the race at large and not allow any white person for whatever reason to dictate to him or interpret for him what being negro means because white directors are very guilty of this i have a diary of such incidents and have lost several jobs because of this we are a race of people with a dual cultural heritage in the field of jazz and rhythmandblues our identity is clearly reflected we are american with an african ancestry what an exciting theatrical combination we should not have to choose which one of these combinations we wish to project one enhances the other its like meat and potatoes bread and butter greens and cornbread one makes the other taste better why should black performers have to conform to values which have so little meaning to them why should they give up something valuable and vital in their own backgrounds in order to fit in ideally all mr kerr and the audience should be concerned with is the talent and craftsmanship of the performer ability is all that should ever be in question was the actor believable if the answer is yes then the audience has understood the meaning of the word universal does it seem reasonable for black actors to give up their individuality the root of their own creative and artistic life in order to blend into or become the same as their fellow white performers if this were to happen the american theater would indeed lose an integral part of real reality contrary to what mr kerr believes the role of the actor seems to me to be that of creation if he can create he can therefore impersonate through the use of dialects costumes makeup and behavior pat terns none of which has to do with skin color let us not confuse impersonation with imitation because that is what in fact is being suggested here in television and movies the black actor has been required to be or has become an exact copy of the white actor in order to obtain jobs let this tragedy not happen in the theater because of the black actors burning desire to become a part of the existing broadway establishment with all its middle class values he has not been able to solicit or maintain a mass black audience he must fight typecasting where qualities and skin coloring take precedence over training ability experience and in some cases even talent he must fight the theory of nonprotest plays life is just a bowl of cherries plays romantic boy meeets girl boy marries girl they live happily ever after plays these situations are not reallife situations to black audiences and as long as we have no audience we will have no power white people support the theater because it is geared toward whites one of our jobs as black actors should then be to remedy this evil we must create an audience we must therefore feed our talent into the black ghettos even while we are still personally pursuing jobs on broadway in order initially to acquire this audience the black writer and actor should become a part of the black community it is impossible to support a blackoriented play without a black audience the producer writer director actor and technician should grow handinhand with this audience one cannot survive without the other when purlie victorious was produced on broadway the actors had to attend banquets dinners churches parties dances and benefits many times directly after their show each night in order to obtain an audience the extra stress and strain should not be placed on any actor black or white the big broadway shows simply use national television to promote ed sullivan tonight show today show merv griffin show etc the few black plays successfully produced either on or offbroadway have been supported under tremendous odds by black people day of absence happy ending raisin in the sun these producers had to fight to keep their shows open and they pridefully point to the fact that black people helped them do this but it seems only logical that if these same plays were produced by the same professional company in a black community they would triple the amount of black theatergoers thereby creating a power base again this has been proven in the music field but musicians have had a longer time to develop their craft and they have not sacrificed or lost their ethnic root in the process look at the apollo lines form around the block to see black entertainers this is something with which the audience can identify as well as enjoy and when a performer warrants international acclaim some clever white producer brings him downtown to philharmonic or carnegie hall it therefore seems at this point our best and most realistic hope is to go back home back to the black community and begin to build a new theater a theater that is not broadwayoriented a theater where you can call the shots as you see them and not be afraid of losing your job a theater where you will be free to experiment and to create a theater where you can relax and be colored colored in speech movement and behavior patterns a theater where you can stop denying and begin identifying then and only then will you be able to create a power base which will allow you to become selfassertive you will then build a following which will enable you to name your price on broadway perhaps this is a form of separation not segregation but as of now i see no other alternative in a short run it will seem to delay the day but in a long run it will most definitely save it save it for the theater and for the generations to come dont worry when you build this theater white people will come in droves by subway foot bus car and even by chauffeurdriven limousine standing first in line to buy tickets theyre smart that way playwrights in dark glasses een who was res ir t sponsible for the na ii k t ona oallery of art f in washington d c was told by his wife when they were vacationing in cannes to take their eight year old daughter down to the mediterranean to swim so he did the child put one foot in the water and ran to her father saying its cold duveen said sit down stay here ill be back when he returned he was carrying a small pot of boiling water his child watched him pour it into the sea and she stepped in without a murmur i recall another story about august strindberg the great swedish playwright when his grandson climbed into his lap and said spontaneously grandfather can god see in the dark he replied quietly no but your grandfather can the incident of the little girl stepping into the sea and the questions of the little boy are part of the answer to the use and the function of all the arts it is difficult to say what the arts are any of the artsdrama dance poetry architecture painting and sculpture in the words of edna st vincent millay it is like trying to define the colors of sunset to a friend bom blind the artist can help us to survive in a confused neurotic wicked and undefined world by pouring warm water into the cold sea he can look into the dark recesses of our hearts and help us understand what we are and why we are he can also hold up ideals of comic laughter and of human suffering to aid us in better understanding our fellow men he also knows that through the ages nothing has changed only the shadows and the sunshine are in different places there can be a common definition of what art is and especially drama since it embraces all of the arts what do shakespeare langston hughes mies van der rohe chekhov picasso el greco the great cathedral of santa sophia richmond barthe duse miles page billie holiday charlie chaplin michaelangelo sidney poitier martha graham james baldwin and even walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs have in common perhaps robert edmund jones the scenic designer encompassed it when he said you get an idea you set it down and it is there forever this might be one of the keys to unlock the magic and the wonder of artistic creation universality is another although each creation in any of the arts must have a local habitation and a home it must also be universal i remember reading that an actress from abroad came to new york and the first thing she wanted to see was lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun her friend asked her what did you think of it did you understand it the actress replied why of course women everywhere especially mothers strive to fulfill the good life for their children or for their friends a sense of insecurity is necessary for all artists when they become fat in mind pompous in spirit and repetitive in language and creation they become like gogols dead souls w h auden put it in a succinct way towards the end of his poem the flight into egypt safe in egypt we shall sigh for lost insecuritv only when her terrors come does our flesh feel quite at home richard wright for example wrote in native son black boy and uncle toms children of the terror the hurt the crushed spirits and the laughter through tears of the negros state of being in this country when he became rich and famous he fled to paris and stayed there his life was peaceful unannoyed unmississippi and his writing became that too even so the play native son is now dated because of the blatant propagandists theme and projection inevitability which means that there can be no other way to do what the artist wants to do is another key the seal of his imaginative characterizations cannot be erased in any way james baldwin in amen corner has created human beings who are truthful because their road to success or ruin cannot be altered in any way they act as they must they speak and feel as they must there is no artificiality that tolling hill of truth gongs throughout this tortured and moving world of the storefront church juxtaposition must always be present in some of the best and feeblest plays of langston hughes he never forgot that laughter sorrow and tragedy go side by side in simply heavenly for example there is simples hilarious speech of what he would do if he were in command of a white regiment of soldiers from the deep south throughout this long speech we laugh with the laughter of understanding afterwards we know that mr hughes has dug the knife deep into the conscience of white america and struck that tolling bell for negroes with dead souls but who survive because they understand the ridiculousness of their position in we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal suggestiveness no playwright ever tells all but leaves a great deal to the imagination of the audience so that they as audience can interpret and participate there was a boy in the navy who was darker than eggplant but very handsome whenever he had to go to the town he went through alleys and bypassed crowds because he thought they would laugh at him i slipped a note under his door which said im so black they call me night time when i walk along everyone looks for stars after that he strolled along the wide sidewalks of chicago with a kind of humble and beautiful pride the point is made when clifford odets has one of the women in paradise lost say if i had a child id give it toys of gold to play with these are just some of the few elements that all works of art must have if they are to survive beyond their time one of the things that is difficult for any minority group and especially its artists to understand is that they are not alone in their suffering that from the sores of job to the weeping mothers whose sons die in vietnam and the terrible torture to the hearts of the people whose children died in the bombed church in birmingham there is a symbolism of the tie between time ago time now and time ahead most of the negro playwrights seem to think that the suffering of negroes is only the suffering of negroes and although in shakespeares words they give this suffering their own local habitation and a home they are hardly giving it a universality that will command artistic distinction and lasting power leroi jones certainly has daring ironic thrust and shocking power however he has none of the qualities listed above in his play the toilet he is saying that the world is a toilet and that the flushing of the urinals and seats is the flushing he is trying to give to a sordid world the total of his works so far except the baptism has the disgusting quality that he means it to have in dutchman he goes far beyond bounds of any artistic law to shock and disgrace an audience into his way of thinking his use of four letter words in these plays seem to be put in to make life as real as he thinks it is playwrights with winning and timeless power have been able to create the same atmosphere that jones wishes to create with their special language that conjures up our imagination because we have not heard these things before in shakespeares hamlet hamlet says of his stepfather remorseless lecherous treacherous kindless villain o vengeance instead of saying as leroi jones might say my stepfather is full of shit sean ocasey has created characters who have experienced all the tortures of hell and who have never seen the face of god their anger and their anguish holds our attention through the rightness of their language which reflects not only their hearts but their souls mrs boyle after her son has been killed in a local bloody revolution in dublin ireland says to her daughter what was the pain i suffered johnny bringing you into the world to carry you to your cradle to the pains ill suffer carryin you out o the world to bring you to your grave mother o god mother o god have pity on us all blessed virgin where were you when me darlin son was riddled with bullets when me darlin son was riddled with bullets sacred heart o jesus take away our hearts o stone and give us hearts o flesh take away this murderin hate an give us thine own eternal love jean genets the blacks uses music flaring tempers anger poetry and the dance without losing his essential theme black versus white he is daring and provocative he may break wind in our faces but like the greek playwright aristophanes his satire and his apparently amused state of our world shames us while also being a work of art james baldwin wrote a confused and eloquent play in blues for mister charlie it is not a very good one but sometimes goes in the direction of the great greek drama as in that speech of lyle the white murderer who bends over the dead body of richard saying and may every nigger like this nigger end like this nigget face down in the weeds juanita during the trial says with force and greek passion i dont want to be gods mother he can have his icy snowwhite heaven if he is somewhere around this fearful planet if i ever see him i will spit in his face in gods face how dare he presume to judge a living soul a living soul mama is afraid im pregnant mama is afraid of so much im not afraid i hope im pregnant i hope i am one more illegitimate black babythats right you jive mothers and i am going to raise my baby to be a man a man you dig oh let me be pregnant let me be pregnant dont let it all be gone a man juanita a man oh my god there are no more for me did this happen to mama sometime who vanished like smoke and left her to get through this world as best she could is that why she married my father did this happen to mother henry is this how we all get to be mothersso soon of helpless menbecause all the other men perish no no no no what is this world like i will end up taking care of some man some day help me do it with love pete meridian parnell we have been the mothers for them all it must be dreadful to be parnell there is no flesh he can touch all of it is bloody incest everywhere haha youre going crazy juanita oh lord dont let me go mad let me be pregnant let me be pregnant so many of our negro playwrights are so saturated with the idea of negro oppression which of course they should be that they have left out the lasting power the universality of their art they just keep trampin they arent trying to make heaven their home they seem to prefer infernos to the blaze of light that can come in the future many of them have discipline like lofton mitchell and william branch but they hardly have the daring or the flair to infuse high vision with our present angry condition at the end of an opera written for the centennial of howard university the wife of medgar evers sings they think theyve bitten our tongues out cried out our eyes warped out our nerves and left us crippled in this searching sun to rot and wash our dry faces in the dust of their shame they are wrong we will bury you my joe so many thousand strong and from your grave the flowers of freedom will grow with iron strength oh my boy remember they are wrong we will bury you my joe so many thousand strong and from your grave the flowers of freedom will grow with iron strength oh my love remember your father remember us all and tear the teeth that bite you everywhere you roam remember your father went out to meet the foe n almost every country there have been playwrights who have written of and about their times in terms of their ethnic group the best of them have survived and will survive because the conditions about which they write have been set down in terms we may all understand without losing the healing and blessed presence of artistic values the healing and blessed presence of artistic values the flame that died the untimely death of otis redding marks a tragic and immeasurable loss to modern blues music otis played a historic role in reviving the feeling of the traditional blues and reinterpreting them for todays generation in a sense his sounds were a vital link between the music of the old traditional black communities of the rural south and the more recent rapidly growing black ghettos of the north and west in order to fully understand the significance of otis contribution to modern music it is necessary to briefly review the status of the blues over the past few decades although the traditional country blues provided the base for rhythm and blues jazz rock and roll and other dominant music forms today during the fifties and sixties they had begun to lose their influence except for the persistent popularity of only the most widely known blues singers each as b b king and muddy waters the popularity of traditional blues music as a whole was losing ground especially in the northern urban areas as more and more black people migrated from the rural south to the big cities further north they became more urbanized more americanized this influenced their music in that they became more concerned with refining the beat of their songs pronouncing the words of songs correctly and omitting the groans shouts and slurring of words of the blues the decline in the popularity of the blues became so great that several older blues artists such as memphis slim and sonny boy williamson left this country to live or work in europe they maintained that the people here no longer appreciate the blues the problem however was not simply a loss in appreciation for the blues it was also the fact that the older blues artists represented an older generation and their music was not completely in tune to changing times and conditions what was needed was a young blues singer who could adapt the soul of the traditional blues to the feelings and experiences of the younger generation the man whose historical destiny was to fulfill this need was none other than otis reddingalso known as the big o and the mad man from macon otis first hit recording these arms of mine was deep in the tradition of the country blues in fact when it first came out many people thought it was performed by one of the older less recognized blues singers of the south by a singer about or years of age but at that time otis was only years old and had just begun to develop as an artist the genius of otis redding was evident from his first recording but perhaps one of the best examples of his genius and versatility is contained in his second album the great otis redding sings soul ballads in otis first album there still are traces of his early influence little richard but by his second album otis is completely himself in the second album otis not only did soulful blues sides which he had helped to compose such as chained and bound come to me and mr pitiful he also did some ballads which had been made popular by other artists for your precious love its too late and a woman a lover and a friend otis did not imitate these ballads in the fashion of the artists who made them but reworked them giving them a fresh blues orientation and often surpassing the efforts of the previous artists the essential differences was the unique blues voice of otis together with his instinctive ability to sing directly from the heart otis natural voice enabled him to do what most other singers could not do he could use slurring words grunts groans and shouts to produce the sweetest of music also he was especially creative in making music out of special sounds unique to his manner of improvisation those distinctive otis sounds such as nanananana ou we ni and fafafafafa but otis did not rely upon his voice alone he was a perfectionist in blending the unique quality of his voice with the singing quality of the horns and the rhumba blues beat of the rhythm section his songs in person and recordings are distinguished by the fact that the instrumental background never clutters or works against his voice the two consistently come off really smooth the sound of the big o reached its peak in the years his own songsive been loving you too long respect fafafafafa good to methose he reworked such as satisfaction and try a little tendernessand those he did with carla thomastramp and knock on woodwere just a few of those which gained him international fame there is no question that otis deserved the title king of soul for he was the primary force behind the worldwide recognition and popularity of soul music today and his artistry is one of the best examples of the soul sound as his music indicates otis was an integral part of the profoundly spiritual culture of the black south it was the black communities of the deep south which produced and nurtured him and it was to these communities that he continually returned as the primary source of inspiration for his music and lifes work w e b du bois description of the spiritual qualities of black culture in his book gift o f black folk is also an apt description of the music of otis redding for after all the two are really the same as du bois said of black culture it is hard to define or characterize it a certain joyousness a sensuous tropical love of life a slow and dreamful conception of the universe an intense sensitiveness to spiritual valuesall these things and others like to them tell of the impact of africa on europe in america otis appreciation of these deep spiritual values of his roots provided the power behind his artistry and personality fully aware that the blues emanated from the people he was truly a poet of the people who sung for the masses and not just for the socalled cultured and sophisticated sets it is now well known how the titles and themes of his songs always reflected the elemental emotions and aspirations of the massessecurity respect just one more day good to me moreover otis always sought to keep the form of his songs at a level where they would remain meaningful to the people in an interview in soul magazine he stated basically i like any music that remains simple and i feel this is the formula that makes soul music successful when any music form becomes cluttered andor complicated you lose the average listeners ear there is nothing more beautiful than a simple blues tune there is beauty in simplicity whether you are talking about architecture art or music in effect otis whole life reflects his genius for recognizing beauty in simplicity he developed the natural gifts inherent in the crude and obscure elements of his lowly country background to become an artist of the highest caliber and of international repute as was brought out in the testimonials given at his funeral otis was a natural prince who sat with those of the highest status in world society but he never lost the common touch and never forgot his family friends and people wilford coates a member of otis personal staff said of the building that housed the offices of otis redding enterprises this building used to be a chicken produce house they cleaned the chickens in the basement and sold them upstairs youd never know it now everything otis touched turned beautiful coming up in a time when the black man is on the rise and coming into his own otis further recog nized that his creativity need not be limited to singing alone he also established successful firms for publishing music and managing young singers and he had developed into an accomplished recording producer outside the field of music he had an honest interest in helping black youth according to his lawyer he had given many scholarships to black students about which the public knew nothing he did these things purely out of his dedication to youth without seeking publicity or reward one of the special projects he was working on at the time of his death was the construction of a summer camp for underprivileged youth from the urban slums and ghettos otis death was so untimely and unexpected that it is nearly impossible to adjust to it at the time of his death he had just recuperated from a minor throat ailment and was beginning to build upon his newly recognized position as the king of soul music he understood the times he lived in and was doing the things he wanted to do for life no one expected his reign to be so brief the only way in which i can reconcile the shock and untimeliness of his death is to repeat a quote that was used to explain the early death of malcolm_x the candle light that burns the brightest dies out the quickest no light in modern music especially the blues burned brighter than that of otis redding we are blessed to have had him around as long as we did for langston hughes and stella holt in at one of those perennial writers g conferences the brilliant arna bontemps told the story of old sis goose she was swimming on a lake and a sheriff appeared and ordered her off the lake the sheriff was a fox and old sis goose snapped that she had a right to swim on the lake the sheriff arrested her and when they got to the jailhouse old sis goose looked up and saw the jailkeeper was a fox too when her case got to trial old sis goose looked around and saw that the prosecuting attorney was a fox her own lawyer was a fox and the court clerk was a fox the judge himself was a fox and when the jury appeared every member of it was a fox sis goose shook her head and said i aint got long to stay here i borrowed mr bontemps yarn on february it was on the occasion that marked the refurbished greenwich mews theater being dedicated to the memory of langston hughes and stella holt that date also would have been the sixtyseventh birthday of the great langston hughes it was an altogether fitting gesture on the part of the village presbyterian church and brotherhood synogogue sponsors of the greenwich mews theater which is housed in the basement of the building at west th street in new york city this theater under stella holts leadership had introduced several black playwrights to the downtown area and it has consistently produced the plays of the late mr hughes ttiere was considerable discussion after mr hughes death about a drive being led by stella holt to name the theater the langston hughes theater when stella followed langston to the grave there was talk too of naming the institution the langston hughesstella holt theater then there was a hue and a cry from righteous souls that the langston hughes theater should be housed in harlem no one bothered to note that negroes belong in greenwich village as much as they do in harlem no one bothered to remember that in when new york city was a dutch outpost known as new amsterdam african slaves were imported tfiey were housed on the fringe of what is now the bowery these africans built a wagon road to the upper part of the settlementto a place the dutch called haarlem then spelled with two as eighteen years later with the support of the rankandfile white colonists the africans petitioned the dutch for freedom received it and settled in a swampland which they built into a prosperous community that community is today known as greenwich village indeed the first negro theater known to this country existed in greenwich village this was the african grove theater housed at bleecker and grove streets this group performed shakespearean plays in the year the group was spearheaded by james hewlett and it had a great influence on actor ira aldridge the destruction of the african grove by white hoodlums had a marked influence upon mr aldridges career he realized then that america offered little hope to black actors and he sailed for europe where he was acclaimed by royalty it was indeed senseless to suggest that the langston hughes theater should not be housed in greenwich village at any rate the church and the synagogue leaders settled the entire matter when they decided to keep the name greenwich mews and dedicate the theater to mr hughes and miss holt the hit show running there at the time consists of two oneacters by the african playwright wole soyinka directed by cynthia belgrave and produced in association with miss belgraves husband kenneth farris that offering was suspended for the evening and those who appeared at the dedication stepped first into the theater lobby where a handsome plaque was placed on the lobby wall here too stood a picture of mr hughes and miss holt the curtain was down in the refurbished theater and there was a heavy silence about the place a silence of respect admiration and love the audience then went upstairs to the church this church since has been unique in religious terms for that year dr jesse w stitt the presbyterian minister and rabbi irving block joined forces and organized what is now known as the village presbyterian church and the brotherhood synagogue dr stitt spoke of stella holts efforts in the nineteenfifties to persuade him to permit the founding of the greenwich mews theater rabbi block also spoke others on the program were actress miriam colon raoul abdul who had worked closely with mr hughes and maxwell t cohen who had been a lawyer for both mr hughes and miss holt for the second half of the program there was a performance of jericho jimcrow featuring gilbert price joseph attles hilda harris dorothy drake rosalie king barney hodges and the hugh porter gospel singers the story about old sis goose was told because i felt both langston hughes and stella holt knew the meaning of that story i think that is why they were honored in that theater they both loved so much and i think that is why too both of them made worthy contributions to our culture the easiest thing in the world to do and the quickest way to success is to cut down a man of color the examples are numerous that filthy war in asia where men of color are being killed needlessly that filthy nation known as the republic of south africa which is supported by the american empire and that filthy situation in rhodesia the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color immediately comes to mind such names as denmark vesey paul robeson patrice lumumba malcolm_x ben bella nkrumah muhammad ali richard wright and langston hughes and stella holt the custom is with us today and anyone who doesnt believe me should work for one day in the city of new york department of social services or in the antipoverty program in fact cutting down a black man has become so fashionable that black people are getting in on the act look at what james baldwin did to richard wright with his alas poor richard look at what saunders redding did to julian mayfield and countless other black writers look at the daily insults that add to the weight of a writers years when people consistently ask why dont you write this kind of stuff or that kind of stuff why arent you rich with all the stuff you put out would you write this for me on speculation would you give me a free autographed copy of your book the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color langston hughes and stella holt never played that game they were beautiful people and they paid dearly for their beauty i first met langston hughes when i was a boy in harlem clubleaders andrew burris glenn carrington and zell ingram introduced me to his work which i loved later actordirectorproducer dick campbell invited me to ioin his rose mcclendon playersa group he had built in memory of that great black actress i joined mr campbells group and worked in his shows and he introduced me to people i had read about for years one night i went with him and his late wife muriel rahn to see a play by langston hughes called dont you want to be free it was presented at west th street in almost the same spot that now houses the offices of state senator basil paterson and the new york courier the leading role was played by robert earl jones and later by albert grant the work itself was the forerunner of mr hughes jericho jimcrow that night i first met langston hughes he shook my hand and he stood there that eternal cigarette dangling from his lips and i stood there openmouthed and overwhelmed i did not see him again for many years college naval service and endless travel kept us apart in the early s actors maxwell glanville and julian mayfield produced ossie davis first play alice in wonder ruby dee starred in the play and i was its associate producer when we presented it at the elks community theater i met mr hughes again we went into a scene he insisted upon paying his way into the theater and i insisted that he not pay it was our honor to have him there he told me ive got to help the group in some way and he placed a bill on the table and entered the theater later we met at various gatherings and talked about writing he was particularly fond of my two sons tommy and melvin and he used to send them his books when they were published our paths crossed again in the greenwich mews theater had optioned his play simply heavenly but for some reason the work couldnt be done in that theater i believe some influential people in top positions objected to the fact that much of the play was set in a bar there is always some reason for not doing a play by a black playwright he doesnt have enough teeth or he didnt have the work properly typed or the season isnt right or some such nonsense the same kind of excuses are given for not having a black quarterback playing professional football allamerican sandy stephens couldnt really throw or he liked to run too much with the ball or hank washington needs seasoning and theyll probably find out that the great jimmy raye is too short too tall or too something or other anyway simply heavenly could not be done at the mews while plans were being made to present it in another theater i completed the play that came to be known as a land beyond the river fellow playwright david timmons invited me to his house to read the script mr timmons had no heat in his house and i told him that while i am a northern boy who loves cold weather i do not like it indoors mr timmons then suggested that i meet him at the home of stella holt i did just that and i read my play in the presence of frances drucker stella holt and david timmons stella promptly grabbed the script and said she was going to produce it at the mews andif the mews directors didnt like it she was going to produce the play on her own and she went into motion and when stella holt went into motion she went into motion in fact david timmons and i once labelled stella and fran the special delivery girls well stella delivered a land beyond the river and michael howard who had been scheduled to direct simply heavenly found himself directing my play and dont you know langston hughes was ecstatic because my play was being done he was a big big man he had been out there alone for many many years he never wanted to be the only black writer he created an atmosphere a climate among black writersa brotherhood if an assignment came up hed look into it and pass it on to one of us and we do this today many a time william branch or alice childress or john killens have done much like langston and passed on writing assignments to me often at critical times in the early s i was having a very difficult time langston suggested that i do special research for a book he wanted to write about gypsies he got quite an advance and we signed contracts we kept meeting and talking about writing the book but we never got to do it he called me before he went to california to make a speech and said that when he got back we would definitely get around to writing the book i never saw him again when he returned from california he was stricken and he died a special memorial service was held in the harlem area for langston hughes i telephoned his agent to notify him he said i guess youre going to have to write that gypsy book alone i said that i would he then told me i should be able to get another advance for the publisher had deducted my advance from one of langstons other books when my wife marjorie came home i told her about it and tears came to both our eyes marjorie said he never told you he never told me he was a big big man with a big big heart he was a black man and they cut him to pieces they hacked him he wrote better than hollywood and broadway combined not to mention television but they didnt call on him to write those million dollar lechnicolored movies and make in his words moneys mammy langston once said that gershwin wrote porgy and bess from a downtown penthouse looking at harlem while the duke was riding the a train no they gave him fame but little fortune they didnt want him to earn a decent living and i know why the last thing the american empire wants is cultural equality it does not want to know the truth of the black experience and so its foundations will give lots of money to groups but those groups are not doing the plays of william branch alice childress ossie davis louis peterson theodore ward leroi jones clifford masonall recognized authors the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color and so they cut down langston hughes they allowed him to live long enough to have his intelligence insulted when they offered hallelujah baby instead of goodmorning daddy a hurry sundown instead of a hurried sunrise tired blood when we need youngblood they give us a guess whos coming to dinner when we know who has been starving us for years they will give us anything but justice i first met stella holt in the s when she served as business manager for the greenwich mews theater she impressed me immediately not only for her theatrical vision but also because of her love for humanity she became my beloved friend and after the produc tion of a land beyond the river i made a point of visiting her every time i had completed a new work i always read it to her and to frances drucker and both were always effervescent she and fran came out on a cold rainy day in may to see a special performance of my tell pharaoh and stella immediately went to work trying to have it presented throughout the new york city public school system it was when i visited her to read my new musical ballad of a blackbird that she mentioned that langston called her nightly his calls meant a great deal to her i refused to call stella after langston died i just didnt have the nerve to call her yet i knew i had to call i kept postponing it then finally i clenched my teeth and called she was very ill and the grief in her voice ripped at my ears and jarred me she said she simply couldnt believe that langston had really died no she said he is not dead she went on to say that she and fran were going to the country but she wanted marjorie and me to visit them i promised that we would after all i had to give her a copy of my book black drama to which she and langston contributed so very much i never gave her the book for i never saw her again i was sitting at my typewriter one day when the telephone rang it was stellas brotherinlaw and when he identified himself i cried out oh no there it was my other beautiful friend who had produced plays who had journeyed to harlem one time and arranged a special showing of my play the cellarmy friend who had taken on a land beyond the river before i could get it out of my typewriterhad joined my other beautiful friend and hers this stella holt who like dick campbell produced more works by black playwrights than anyone else i know of in new york city had departed this life stella and langston langston and stella what can i write of them in this society of the foxes this society which is built on cutting down men of color i can only say that i challenge this system to the teeth and i am someday going just like those friends of mine fighting all the way i can go bravely too because the divine creator blessed me by allowing me to walk beside two beautiful people todays black actors are portraying roles beyond their reach years ago and proving that a mans race is no measure of theatrical talent a little black boy born in lower manhattan years before the american civil war became a fleshandblood monument to the same cause under even more trying circumstances in august memorial societies and theaters in the united states and other parts of the world commemorated the onehundredth anniversary of the death of ira frederick aldridge pioneer who won admiration in almost every european country in the middle of the nineteenth century for his shakespearean performances aldridge acclaimed as a genius and one of the most precise interpreters of shakespeare of all time was the first black man to play leading white characters including lear shylock and macbeth for his stage triumphs he received many honorsamong them the medal for art and science from frederick iv of prussia the cross of leopold from the emperor of russia and the maltese cross in switzerland in the republic of haiti awarded him a commission in the army of haiti in the seventeenth regiment of the grenadier guards of the president of the republic franz joseph emperor of austria presented him with the medal of ferdinand he was made a brother mason of the grand lodge of ireland in at that time the prussian gold medal had been awarded only to german naturalist baron von humbolt italian composer gasparo spontini and franz liszt but this was not aldridges most important official recognition in the royal family of england made him a member of the royal saxon house order aldridge capping all earlier successes had become the first member of his race to be knighted throughout his life he often referred to himself as chevalier ira aldridge knight of saxony as is often the case time and scant information have caused a great deal of legend and fantasy to become interwoven with the facts of aldridges life ira aldridge was born in new york on july although he is claimed by senegal west africa and bel air in harford county maryland this date is supported by several official documents including his death certificate it has been theorized that iras father daniel aldridge who died september in new york was brought to america as a slave but it is more likely that daniels father came to this country in bondage and dubbed aldridge after his master iras mother lurona died while he was still a child daniel aldridge intended his son for a career in the ministry but the youth had already made up his mind about his lifes workhe wanted to be an actor as a student at the african free school in new york ira won prizes in speaking this sign that he had talent to be developed turned the boys love for the theater into a passion dramatic performances available to a black performer in the early s were very limited ira must have saved his pennies to see the shows the way modem youngsters use their allowances to see motion pictures on saturdays mystery swirls around the details but the aspiring actor probably made his first stage appearance at browns theater in new york which opened in at a time when james hewlett was the star attraction later he attempted the role of romeo after a taste of success the young black actor must have realized that the united states offered him little chance to advance in his craft and he decided to emigrate to europe james and henry wallack actors of that period befriended aldridge and when james boarded a ship for liverpool ira shipped as a steward on the same vessel the rumor persisted throughout aldridges career that he had been wallacks personal attendant aldridge arrived in england in and he may have studied for a time at glasgow university britain was in the process of abolishing slavery in its colonies and sympathy for blacks was strong feelings ran high and aldridge used this to his advantage with wallacks backing and a favorable social situation he made his first appearances at either the royalty or coburg theaters in london in october he began his first engagement with top billing at the coburg after playing to packed houses his performances were extended for four weeks aldridge used the title mr keene tragedian of colour early in his career an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame of edmund kean a wellknown contemporary actor later he became known as the african roscius after the roman actor quintus roscius gallus who lived before the birth of christ aldridge always demonstrated a flair for publicity and it is possible he gave himself this name the african roscius claimed his ancestors were african princes but this too may have been a romantic story he devised after his successful london engagement aldridge toured the provinces for several years treating the time as an apprenticeship he studied hard and refined his techniques later he traveled deep into russia bringing the works of shakespeare for the first time to remote towns and villages during these performances he often spoke his lines in english while the rest of the cast used their native tongues aldridge adopted england as his homeland and was granted british citizenship in november he married twice and had two sons and two daughters after touring russia and the continent for the last few years of his life aldridge died august in lodz poland apparently of a lung ailment that had plagued him for some time two days later he was buried in the evangelical cemetery there his tombstone a large cross was erected in there are memorial chairs in the shakespeare memorial theater at stratforduponavon in the fourth row of stalls is one with a bronze plate that tells it is dedicated to ira aldridge the african roscius is at last among his peers the brothers and sisters had been swaying to night train and grinding to harlem nocturne which sets the time as the early s in a black night spot in newark the band leader lynn was blowing hard the congregation screamed urged him on he started marching across the stage the sidemen joined and then off the stage and into the crowd that filled the graham their heads bad they moved near the back of the hall chanting and swaying and passed right in front of me writes leroi jones who fell in line behind the last wild horn man strutting like the rest of them everyone joined in the march around the hall but their energy would not be contained five or six hundred hoppedup woogies tumbled out into belmont avenue defying sunday night traffic narrator jones reflects we screamed and screamed at the clear image of ourselves as we should always be ecstatic completed involved in a secret communal expression it would be the form of the sweetest revolution to hucklebuck into the fallen capital and let the oppressors lindy hop out we marched all the way to spruce weaving among the stalled cars laughing at the dazed white men who sat behind the wheels the book is tales grove press and includes of them the best of whichas in the screamers abovecelebrates the truly black experience perhaps better than has yet been accomplished in the world of letters leroi jones in these mostly autobiographical works depicts black life as he saw it indeed lived it never sacrificing authenticity in favor of white readers understanding the clear image of ourselves as we should always be is a recurring and never dully stated theme of jones last few years labor with much poignancy he gives evidence of a mature understanding of the black lifestyle and in these tales as in his essaysthere is an omnipresent insistence that the power of black people is found in their lifestyle jones commands to be heard we are the zigzags of our own design is it secret are they walking the streets each night with hands in their pockets to see god the question burns and one knows immediately that the answer is not found in the very white sociology of the harvard irishman it was jones yearning as he puts it for any further separation from where my good grades were sure to lead that led him to the graham that same yearning led him also to the point where he couldnt walk stupid or unfeeling or in hip germany forever it was my own life i looked at it watched it in other peoples eyes it was nothing to me but real an extraordinary craftsman probably more genius than we dare admit jones has emerged not as americas leading negro writer but rather as her most formidable black artist because he has not turned his back on that energy which is black and which in this land makes black and white diverse and diametrically opposed he recognized that energy and rooted his work in it and only the wild and very poor thrived in grahams or could be roused by lynns histories and rhythms he writes but others have not merely failed to recognize that energyits powerbut would disclaim it america had choked the rest who could sit still for hours under popular songs or be readied for citizenship by slightly bohemian social workers writing about his childhood the short skinny boy with the bubble eyes his military days hitched like a common fool to the air force of the united states or a fantasy about the day after the crackers were defeated this ol cat me an pinball recognized still had a fag thing going for him in a fur coat he was some kind of magistrate bobby and moosie were questioning him about some silver he was supposed to have stashed he was a silver freak the dude was actually weeping crying big sobs the women crowded away from him i guess they really couldnt feel sorry for him because he was crying about money jones always excites one with his ability to communicate motion and his wit compliments his anger which brings to mind something he said before a chicago audience a little over a year ago after years yall still checking the cracker out or at fisk university six months later vietnam is simply whiteys greatest work of art jones laughs at a stupid world and he could have chosen to take some of its more valued prizes a tale called new spirit reveals a humility as rare as his arrogance it is a painfully personal undertaking about a young girl who died who was his lover filled with haunting honestyall the more haunting if you dug the young girls speed and jive one morning in newark for just a few minutes and thought her unusually kind and remember that you were a mite confused by the presence of the young girl and the other woman who were like sisters and who spoke lovingly of roi leroi jones doubtless is a man obsessed with a need to share all that is his life in these tales he does exactly that with a perfect dignity meanwhile he is placed on trial in the wilderness of new jersey for something or other while in the country of his birth the president lacks even imperfect dignity while calling for a national day of prayer who is the enemy but jones can write the shapes in the darkness had histories falling out of windows failing to become mayor of their mothers universes we must work together put on the right brightness stop killing each other wheel to face the actual killers i wanted to do this and wheel and wheel and wheel and be and couldnt monkees walked on my fingers people misunderstood is there a more painful truth in our day any daydavid llorens begin with there v i is reason to hope i that the long famine of kztdesa significant theater in the black communities of america is nearing an end the hope lies in the resurgence of cultural excitement and creativity among the young if for no other reason than through cultural fallout there is cause to be optimistic about the theatrical arts but there also appears to be more concrete cause all over the country young black minds which have been inspired and liberated by the black revolution are seeking out fresh and native modes of expression they are finding the courageand increasingly the supportto turn their backs on the grand gurus of the arts in america who would define for them the nature and needs and limits of their artistic expression with that said it also must be admitted that there is little theatrical activity around at the moment to make the hope for the future seem much more than that there is a great deal of theatrical activity yes but much of it is of the conventional variety primarily conventional in both conception and goal there are however certain outstanding exceptions most of them centered in the area of manhattan in a way the most important theatrical enterprise in new york is the new lafayette theater which under the direction of robert macbeth got off to a bright start last october mr macbeth and his small company took over the rehearsal hall of the old lafayette theater in harlem and aided by grants from the ford foundation the new york state arts council and the rockefeller foundation launched a season with playwright ronald milners whos got his own which a season earlier had been produced downtown at the american place theater they also did athol fugards the blood knot mr macbeth brought in playwright ed bullins from san francisco as playwrightinresidence and scheduled mr bullins threeact play in the wine time for spring production things did not go entirely well however and the first of the year found mr macbeth and company on the premises of the american place theater where mr bullins three oneactersa son come home which is published on page and the being the claras old man electronic niggerwere prepared for performance problem uptown was primarily one of funds an old sad familiar story the beautifulif impractical innovation of the new lafayette theater was the free entrance policy for the people of harlem the people came to the seat theater that reported percent and mr macbeth the theater was filled on week days and completely filled on weekends then in february the new lariously ing comvard ver phil cohran copyrighted material the mr fayette theater myste burned leaving the fledgli pany with no base tov end of the month howe macbeth announced that he had received another grant from the new york foundation contingent upon his raising matching funds and that a campaign was underway to secure for the theater meanwhile he was searching for a theater of some seats in the harlem community and he seemed hopeful mr macbeth was quoted in the new york times as saying that the new theater when it is located will do adaptations or revisions of the works of bertold brecht and albert camus as well as the works of black playwrights one hopes that he will reconsider this there are hundreds of theater groups on and off broadway performing the works of white playwrights black playwrights desperately need the exposure black theater groups can give them the theater which had raised the highest hopes and which caused the most excitement over the past few months is the negro ensemble company the brainchild of douglas turner ward and robert hooks the nec as it is popularly termed is considered elsewhere on these pages in articles by peter bailey and dick campbell but it is fair to note that the unfurled program of the theater met with considerable disappointment in the black community the nec received an unprecedented from the ford foundation ostensibly for the promotion and cultivation of the theater arts among black people and it was generally accepted that the nec went out of its way in failing to fulfill a part of its purpose the criticism centered around the necs failure to seek out and produce the works of black american playwrights of the four plays announced for necs first season three are the works of white playwrights although one play was adapted from the french by the late richard wright the fourth play kongis harvest by the nigerian wole soyinka had its premiere performance during the first world festival of negro arts at dakar senegal in april confronted with this criticism mr ward responded by indicating that acceptable plays by black playwrights were not available such playwrights as loften mitchell alice childress ted ward and ronald milner replied that they had not been approached by mr ward or anyone else from nec that criticism aside the nec evidently is living up to its expectations in other areas in the companys first production peter weiss song of the lusitanian bogey the acting was all firstrate the staging provocative the direction keen and powerful and this was the work of black actors directors and technicians mr ward has indicated that in succeeding seasonsthe nec will produce the works of black playwrights it is to be hoped that this will be so nevertheless one is left with nagging questions about the real intentions of the nec directors relative to the black community mr ward sought to justify the location of his theater in greenwich village on the grounds that it was between harlem and bedfordstuyvesant the two major centers of black population in the new york area thereby facilitating travel to second avenue and eighth street by people from both communities it is a flimsy rationalization the nec appeal is directly to sophisticated white audiences on a typical weekend night there were five black people in the capacity audienceand at least two of those gained admission with press tickets a short distance from the negro ensemble company headquarters in the st marks theater the greenwich mews theater provided a showcase for two plays by wole soyinka the highly regarded nige rian playwright the plays the strong breed and the trials of brother jero were produced under the aegis of farrisbelgrave productions in association with diana sands and afolabi ajayi cynthia belgraves the actress also served as director of the plays the production received almost unanimous raves from the critics and the performances were unquestionably excellent although this writer had seen a superior production of the trials of brother jero several years earlier at karamu house in cleveland ohio as an example of the vitality and enterprise present among black theater people the farrisbelgrave production was singular also it was high time that new yorkers were exposed to the work of black africas most respected playwright again however it is a pity that the people of harlem and bedford stuyvesant will not have easy access to the presentation of talented black theater people in this writers opinion the theater group in the general new york area with most immediate promise for reaching the black communities is playwright leroi jones group over in newark the spirit house movers and players is a repertory company which already has traveled as far afield as massachusetts washington dc connecticut and pennsylvania and there are plans to troupe out to the midwest in the spring at the present plays in the repertory include the militant preacher by ben caldwell arm yrself or harm yrself by leroi jones and we own the night by jimmy garrett three additional jones playsa black mass great goodness of life and home on the range plus plays by ed bullins joe white and ben caldwell are in preparation for the company the spirit house movers and players is of course innovative in intent its format is broad enough to embrace for example skits and poetry readings and a youth group called the young black militants all presently years of age is a popular feature of the theater group among the actors at spirit house are yusef iman barry wynn carl boissiere david mitchell larry miller mubar ic mahud salimah barbara wynn jacqueline bugg sandra lein sylvia jones and herbie stokes robert washington is stage manager and james campbell and leroi jones are directors march was scheduled as the month for the opening of a doublebill by playwright william wellington mackey in new york assisted by actors agent ernestine mcclendon the playwright brought in from chicago the young director who staged a successful production of one of the two plays requiem for brother x at the hull houses south side theater a year ago the companion play family meeting has never been produced previously dick gaffield is the director during the past season there were several plays both on and off broadway which featured black actors in substantial roles diana sands of course portrayed the title role in george bernard shaws st joan a production of the repertory theater of lincoln center miss sands is a fine actress and st joan was well staged and well acted but the whole affair held little attraction for black audiences claudia mcneil appeared in a silly charade called something different and pearl bailey headed still heads a cast of beautiful black people in the colorful fluff hello dollyl josephine premice took the leading role in a new version of truman capotes fanciful house of flowers and cleavon little was the black sex symbol in scuba duba a group of vibrant and attractive young people black and white made of the musical drollery hair an especially delightful and provocative evening all exuberance and irreverence and as relevant as rain and air almost unnoticed black dancers and choreographers have stolen the theater lead from black actors and playwrights never before has afroamerica been represented by so large a contingent of superlative dancers several of whom also are choreographers of the first rank among them carmen de lavallade alvin ailey donald mckayle eleo pomare talley beatty miguel godreau judith jamison james truitt rod a rodgers arthur mitchell most of these dancers and the works they perform unfortunately are unknown beyond the new york commuting area it is a pity one of the cultural foundations could do a great service by sponsoring say the alvin ailey dancers on a national tour of black communities across the country los angeles seems to have completely overshadowed san francisco in significant theater activity according to our west coast editors the five most active theater groups in the metropolitan los angeles area are mafundi institute douglas house foundation pasla performing arts society of los angeles iccc inner city cultural center and ebony showcase there are of course other groups the institute for black studies for example has a theater wing mafundi which in swahili means artist institute was founded to explore black art and culture it was funded through the brooks foundation actor william marshall is director of the actors workshop and oscar brown jr heads the resident musical group the actors were preparing a black version of oedipus rex at deadline and the musical theater was plan ning a musical under browns direction mafundi institute also is concerned with developing the cinematic arts within the black community the douglass house foundation is perhaps the best known cultural center in the los angeles area because of screenwriter bud schulbergs association with it harry dolan whose screenplay losers weepers was performed on nbctv is director the theater group recently presented an adaptation of herbert a simmons novel corner boy douglass house also sponsors a tv film theater workshop pasla is directly concerned with establishing relevant theater in the black community and the thrust of the organization is nonprofit the theater performed a play for children liar liar during the winter and was preparing several projects at press timein times like these an anthology of folklore among them the iccc is federally funded and is designed to serve the total community with emphasis on those members of minority groups which have not previously had access to training in the theater arts it has received almost from the us office of education and from the national foundation on the arts and the humanities the iccc produces such plays as the seagull richard lit and the caucasian chalk garden the classics in other words of the better known theater groups affecting the black community in los angeles perhaps the ebony showcase is most important the seat theater which is owned by nick stewart was presenting douglas turner wards two plays day of absence and happy ending at press time professional actors as well as novices are involved in the theater and it could develop into the western anchor of a string of independent black theaters across the country in between new york and los angeles the picture of black theater is gloomy in detroit there is the usual number of embryonic groups with talent dispersed and interest uncorralled the most hopeful group now as in the recent past is concept east theater which considers that was an exciting year like newarks spirit house movers and players the concept east theater has turned to repertory theater the actors traveled outside of the state for performances and it is available for community organizations within the state under a joint arrangement with the michigan state council for the arts david rambeau is director mr rambeau also is editor of a new publication the black arts theater magazine chicago is virtually without a vital theater group althoughhere againthere can be found a number of small striving drama units playwright ted ward founded the south side center of the performing arts and reconditioned the louis theater a former movie house but the theater company has not been able to touch the vast black community for several months mr ward presented his yearold play our lan playing on weekends it is not unfair to say that a more recent play might have brought mr wards valiant efforts more attention another chicago theater reconditioned like mr wards is proving a more attractive center for the black community although the theater is not reserved for drama alone the affroarts theater is the base of operations for phil cohran the composer and his artistic heritage ensemble fridays through sundays the public is invited to be entertained by a package assembled by mr cohran consisting of singers and dancers all accompanied by the artistic heritage ensemble the theater also serves during the day as a center of black studies with classes in arabic and swahili lectures in african history and islam during weekday evenings the theater is available for blackoriented presentations and mr cohran is especially interested in having drama groups make use of the theater facilities local dramatists such as val gray ward and gerald wallace alone and with groups help to keep the spirit of theater alive in the city the best known black theater group in the south remains the free southern theater which operates out of new orleans traveling to nearby rural areas under the direction of tom dent black actors however do find employment in white theaters in minneapolis michigan and washington dc it was in washington incidentally that one of the best plays of the season was produced how ard sacklers abrasive the great white hope the play is based on the life and career of former heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson and it is a lulu both episodic and long over hours the play nevertheless demands the attention and it is never boring much of the credit for that of course must go to james earl jones who portrayed jack jefferson johnson he was superb and he was supported by a fine sensitive performance from jane alexander it has been announced that the great white hope will be produced on broadway next season over in rochester mich a suburb of detroit the john fernald company of the meadow brook theater presented and people all around a play based on the murders of three civil_rights workers in mississippi four years ago the play is by george sklar and it was produced a year ago in england at the bristol old vic the play was not warmly received here whether because it is not a good play we cannot report not having seen it but the music and lyrics by booker t bradshaw jr were wildly praised mr fernald it should be noted is not an american but an englishman a former director of the royal academy of dramatic art in london the university of california extension at santa barbara in cooperation with the department of dramatic art conducted under a grant from the us office of education will hold a summer institute repertory theater featuring plays by four black playwrights between june and august the plays will be performed by a repertory company of teachers and trainers in theatrical programs in junior and senior high schools throughout the nation the institute staff includes owen dodson and william brown both familiar to drama students at howard university fellows at the institute will receive weekly with an additional per week for each dependent hoyt w fuller ear don when you told me that you were writing a review attacking robert haydens book kaleidoscope i told you that if i did not agree with you i would write an answer i have read your review and i am writing an answer this is not easy as i know and respect both you and hayden however i shall try to keep my eyes on the object which is the book and to avoid irrelevant issues first i must say that it is not so harsh a review as i expected you tacitly admit the importance of the book by writing a sixpage review of it if it were a negligible book it would be dismissed in one or two paragraphs or not reviewed at all you say that for most readers a sad disappointment is in store then you contradict yourself by praising most of the poems one does not expect every reader to like all the poems in an anthology but when you treat the poets one by one you express liking for the poems of all but two or three you find fault with haydens choices of hughes and jones poems but thats a matter of personal taste the remark you attribute to leroi jones that all it takes to compile an anthology is scissors and a little imagination may be taken out of context as it stands it is so obvious as to be silly an anthology is a collection where else can an editor gather a collection than from previous publications sometimes an edi tor solicits unpublished poems but such collections are not always successful as some poets submit old poems which have been rejected or new poems not quite worked out which later they regret having published prematurely perhaps jones remark would make better sense if it were amplified to say that editors should not confine themselves to other anthologies but should do research in periodicals and the books of individual poets that is what hayden did you say hayden used his imagination in writing some of the biographical sketches but you dont document your charge its true that some of the poems have been anthologized before but you should note which poems and how often some poets like hughes have a large body of work and an editor has a wide choice which hayden took advantage of including several littleknown hughes poems others like toomer whom you praise have published only a few poems and an editors choice is limited in an anthology readers expect to find some familiar poems along with unfamiliar ones a reader reaches for his anthology not the individual poets book which most likely he doesnt own to find classics like if we must die and from the dark tower an editor includes classics like these along with unfamiliar or new poems which will be come classics in their turn what is bad is to constantly reprint a poets secondbest work like tolsons dark symphony preventing exposure of his better work hayden avoids this trap with tolson you call countee cullen emasculated true he wrote in the traditional forms and was influenced by john keats that does not emasculate anyone i dont remember just what i said to you about poems being reprinted in anthologies as i have said various things one remark mav have been that poems become wellknown by being reprinted in anthogies as collections sell more widely than single works another remark may have deplored the reprinting of one poem to the neglect of other work you say that was the second appearance of booker t and w e b in an anthology actually it was the third as it also appeared in rosey pools ik ben die nieuwe neper i dont think three appearances is overexposure in addition hayden selected two poems of mine which had never been anthologized george and souvenirs a percentage of two thirds new poems is a good ratio i believe as i said before i dont find too much to object to in your review your biggest criticism seems to be not with the poems but with haydens introduction i cant follow the beginning of your review very well as its incoherent and confused as one example you say those very words poems by american negro poets and not the books title will sell this anthology those words poems by american negro poets are part of the books title they are what is known as the subtitle often but not always an author chooses a striking original word or phrase for the first part of the title and explains it by a second phrase i think kaleidoscope is an excellent choice a brilliant poetic word suggesting the color and the variety of the poetry in the book the hackneyed second part of the title is a prosaic explanation of the poetic first part this word was chosen by a poet not by a salesman nevertheless i think it will attract many buyers who will feel that the sensitivity which could make such an apt choice would also select good poems as a second example of confusion you ask why we need negro sic anthologies hayden answered that question on page xxiv of his introduction ideological weapons are needed hayden does not antagonize black poets by calling them negro poets he calls them negro poets we do not need ghettos etc television and the other mass media are indeed white ideological weapons all the more reason for us to have some hayden paid his dues by writing distinguished black poetry before you were born his gabriel hanged for leading a slave revolt frederick douglass runagate and middle passage will be alive when you and i are dead and what a gifted poet has to say about poetry is always worthy of consideration have you forgotten voltaires i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it as i interpret haydens remarks they boil down to the conviction that a poet can write about anything without restrictions and that his work should be measured by rigorous standards without inferior work being puffed up just because its black either by white condescension or black chauvinism i agree with your approval of the format and arrangement one excellent feature is the short critical remarks about each poet although perhaps few of the poets will like them as hayden impartially touches not only their strengths but also their weaknesses the book was not intended to be a comprehensive survey and enough poets are left out to make a creditable anthology among them don l lee etheridge knight sonia sanchez carmin auld goulbourne le graham sarah webster fabio welton smith edward spriggs bobb hamilton rolland stallings lawrence p neal theodore horne raymond patterson jay wright and others this is not to criticize as the book accomplishes its purpose of giving an introduction to negro poetry but to observe that other editors can say here is gods plenty and can roll up their sleeves and follow your prescription or proscription of taking their scissors and pasting up another anthology yours dudley randall dear editor sir mr randalls objectivity is somewhat ambiguous or is it just a device he uses to make his remarks sound more convincing at times faulkner in reference to negroes thought he was objective too mr randall is about as objective as an anteater looking for food his friendship with mr hayden is widely known and he should not hide behind a meaningless euphemism mr randall indicated to me before my review was printed that if he disagreed with me he would write a rebuttal which is fine but lets not hide behind an innocent term friendship is preciousa friend is a rare book of which but one copy is madeand a friend or his work should be defended if one deems it necessary first i did not start out or intend in anyway to write a harsh review of mr haydens book i tried to constructively criticize kaleidoscope as truthfully and as honestly as possible in accordance with my beliefs and ideals naturally my personal feelings as to what art is and the function of said art would be expressed in very certain terms i am not so objective as mr randall i agree with mr randall mr haydens book is important the question is in what way does the importance of kaleidoscope live within the context of being a meaningful and eloquent addition to black literature i doubt it is it that kaleidoscope exposed us to young new inventive writers no or even old new inventive writers is it that mr haydens book published heretofore unpublished and hard to find poetryif you consider miss phillis wheatley hard to find yes what is the significance of kaleidoscope there is none except that it is a poor extension of western white literature the bookif not for this brief exchange of wordswould have traveled from editor to publisher to printer back to publisher to book stores unnoticed few if any advanced reviews were written the publishers promotional efforts were minute and the majority of black stores as well as white ones did not stock the book mr randall misread me for i didnt say that for most readers a sad disappointment is in store i qualified my statement with for those of us who buy and read anthologies a sad and also added that blacks who carefully read negro anthologies will be aware of the fact that of the poems in kaleidoscope almost half have been anthologized elsewhere by my count as i see it there is no contradiction but a case of poor reading on mr randalls part as to where the reprinted appeared and to their frequency i would need another six pages yes i feel that mr haydens book is important i reviewed it yet those people who he is obviously trying to appeal to have virtually overlooked kaleidoscope why has not kaleidescope been reviewed by white critics why has the budd schulberg watts anthology received reviews while mr haydens bookboth came out late last yearwas completely blanked out is kaleidoscope important only to black people or will whites read it too mr hayden not only used his imagination in writing some of the biographical sketches but he expects us to believe him he says of miss brooks that she is considered bv some as a spokesman for her race miss brooks has had valuable things to say but she has said them as a poet not as a polemicist that is to say that one who is a polemicist cannot be a poet first we must not forget that to be black in this country is to be controversial and that polemics are associated with controversy second good poetry by nature of style and content can be polemic eg the chicago defender sends a man to little rock of leroi james he said much of jones poetry is in no legitimate sense racist and propagandist which is to say that a good portion of jones poetry is racist and propagandist for negro professors of literature it may appear to be that way but i suggest that mr hayden reread jones as a black poet and not as the type of poet he wishes him to be jones art is that of the present day black man and he sent that other art back to where it belongedgreece bc all jones is doing and very well i might add is telling the truth which is problack and it seems that the truth is not only offensive to mr hayden and others who try to cut jones up but also to a judge in new jersey if kaleidoscope is such an excellent title why should one need a subtitle to explain it mr hayden as a poet and teacher is i am sure aware of the power of words and understands the motivating factors behind them in my estimation kaleidoscope will only attract people interested in lights colors and rainbows black people will not be moved to seek out such a title and most may not even know the meaning of the word kaleidoscope in content as in its title was established to appeal to white readers and to those readers who consider themselves near white which brings us to countee cullen who was so busy trying not to write black or negro that his only significance as a writer is that he was a good imitation white poet what did mr cullen contribute to black literature to read countee cullen is to read duplicates of robert hillyer john keats and a e housman mr cullen being the exact opposite of langston hughes who did create new forms and explore new ideas and who was able to grow and mature as he advanced in age and who left a great body of black literature which will enable other black writers to learn from and grow too most if not all black poets writing today feel that the word negro with its past and present denotations and connotations is not an accurate description of them or their work ie its an insult just like being called boy all your life evidently mr randall does not know the meaning of paying dues a few distinguished poems aint gone get it black poets like leroi jones are paying dues it is a perpetual thing like eating and dying no black person living today has paid his dues exceptmaybepaul robeson and for mr randall to remotely suggest that mr hayden has is simply a lie people like web du bois and malcolm_x paid dues i now question mr randalls awareness as to the position of the black man in this country is he sick dont quote voltaires political crap to me who mr randall defended web du bois and leroi jones right to say it who mr randall defended those students of the orangeburg sc massacre of right to say it then again mr randall doesnt it depend upon what you are saying and to whom you are saying it that counts mr hayden doesnt have to worry about anyone trying to curtail his right to say it he knows what to saykaleidoscope if nothing else explicitly showed this leroi jones knew what to say too but he wanted to be a man don l lee chicago ill
new needs of f i black people define in ii r large measure the new responsibilities of black leadership because of the success rather than failure of the civil_rights movement and because of socioeconomic changes a new set of priorities has been given to the many needs of black people the new priorities are generally agreed to be those of furthering the political and economic empowerment of black people the new responsibility of black leadership is thus to implement this empowerment some of the more successful leaders in another context have reminded us that political power flows from the barrel of a gun likewise and in a related matter economic power flows from the use of the dollar in both cases however the ultimate power resides in the man behind the gun or the dollar and the force that guides the man is his ideology from the premise that the most fundamental needs of black people are for economic and political power the major thesis of this discussion is that the empowerment of black people has needs of its own the foremost of which is the need for a compatible ideology ideology refers to the interrelated philosophies ideas and assumptions which guide thoughts shape attitudes and thereby underlie actions both groups and members of groups possess either conscious or unconscious ideologies some of which become dominant thus it is difficult to consider the struggle for black empowerment without also considering the dominant ideologies among black people although black people have achieved unity on many specific issues an ideological dualism has existed in black thought since the s this dualism has since then divided black people into two schools of thought polarized around the ideologies of assimilation versus black nationalism the confrontation today between the advocates of black and white together and the supporters of black_power is but the latest stage of this ideological dualism assimilation refers to the process whereby minorities are eventually absorbed into the majority group assimilationist ideologies among black people have been dominated by the pursuit of absorption into the majority as an end in itself minor themes in this ideology have advocated the dispersal of black communities and people the insistence upon a colorblind and individualistic approach to group relations and a deep and abiding faith in the goodwill of the better elements of the majority group on the other hand nationalism in the general case refers to shared group identity or consciousness of kind purposely expressed in institutional or cultural terms minority group nationalism in pluralistic societies such as the united states may take as its prime concern the affairs of the nationality group itself and may or may not seek to establish an independent nationstate more specifically ideologies of black nationalism have traditionally involved the efforts and desires of black people to control their own affairs maintain group cohesion define their own identities and to appreciate and develop their own cultural forms rather than absorption black nationalism has stressed coexistence with the majority and other minorities its most common form of expression has been in black communal and educational institutions thus black nationalist ideologies contrary to assimilationist ideologies have viewed the preservation of the black community as an end in itself the ideologies of assimilation have received considerable attention but serious literature on black nationalism is mixed in quality and lacking in quantity the tendency both in popular and academic literature has been to concentrate almost exclusively on a very narrow range of nationalistic thought devoted primarily to marcus garvey in the s and to the nation of islam after world war ii these two manifestations while important represent a very small segment of a much older larger and broader tradition garvey did not bring black nationalism to the united states it was here waiting for someone exactly like him garvey simply organized a long existing reservoir of black nationalist sentiment in a distinctive manner much the same holds true of the nation of islam to clarify the point of this discussion let it be noted that the general phenomenon of black nationalism discussed here is nationalism with a small n both ideologies of assimilation and of black nationalism have shared a concern for achieving desegregation and the removal of externally imposed constraints upon black people and both have from time to time shared some of the more specific interests of the other but the advocates of assimilation have traditionally displayed more ambivalent attitudes in conflicts between black and nonblack interests black nationalist ideologies on the other hand have historically displayed much less of this type of ambivalence and instead have been more ambivalent about whether or not to remain in the united states within each of the two major historical streams in black thought the respective ideologies have existed in many variants and have been applied to different usages and ends thus allegiances have changed with the issues and conditions of the time but throughout the broad outlines of the duality have remained most important the dominant position within the ideological dualism has shifted back and forth throughout history generally shifts in the dominant position have followed either major historical or sociological changes in the conditions of black people it is difficult to locate the historical ideological positions of black people as a whole but an approximation of the dominant ideology during different periods of the struggle can be found in the writings and statements of black leaders and intellectuals assimilationist ideologies dominated during the colonial period during the war of independence black people as in all wars hoped that their support of and service in the american revolutionary effort would bring the rewards of full citizenship rights and as in the cases of all wars fought by the united states all of which black people served in and supported these hopes were never realized wars however are great stimulators and innovators men are mobilized organized and gain wider perspectives therefore as black people came to recognize that the slogans of freedom and democracy excluded them they turned to themselves and began to develop nationalistic ideologies thus it was in the s that black people began to create black institutions and associations on a nationwide scale by the s black nationalist ideologies had become dominant the civil war and reconstruction witnessed the return to dominance of assimilationist thinking as emancipation and reconstruction gave black people the promise of freedom and full citizenship rights the promises were broken and reconstruction was shortlived but during this brief period black people secured a socioeconomic beachhead and in doing so released nationalistic social forces for this period also marked the beginning of the rise of a new black middle class and the founding of many black colleges businesses and communal institutions thus even though the ideology of assimilation dominated black thinking during the reconstruction period the sociological forces at work beneath the surface were nationalistic and thus the end of reconstruction was rather quickly followed by a return to dominance of nationalistic ideologies the unleashing of the ku klux klan in the south and the rise of the klan mentality all over the country affected black people of both ideological camps the dominant leadership bore the brunt of the attacks and chose to take a position of eschewing civil and political rights in favor of economic development as a result the dominant black leadership in the postreconstruction period came to be both nationalistic and accommodative the rationale was that political and civil_rights would follow economic growth but by the turn of the century such a position proved to be untenable since without legal rights or political power black economic interests were attacked at will and often violently destroyed it was in such a setting that the modern civil_rights organizations first appeared in the first decade of the th century as a minority challenge to the accommodative tendencies of the dominant leadership the appearance of the civil_rights leadership represented a conflict that beqan as a difference of strategy but soon the conflict expanded along the lines of the traditional ideological dualism of assimilation versus nationalism this period from the s to the s is vital to the understanding of todays ideological conflicts these decades opened an important era in the history of black people an era that is drawing to a close today these decades witnessed a leadership conflict that led to the rise to dominance of the civil_rights organizations much though not all of the leadership conflict raged within the black middle class the assimilationist side was represented by the civil_rights leadership which in its early days was considered an overly militant minority within the black community the civil_rights leaders were able to put together a coalition of black intellectuals who opposed the accommodationist policy of the dominant leadership black businessmen who were losing their white customers and the old black middle class which had achieved a degree of integration on the other side ranged the supporters of the dominant leadership which was nationalistic and had its locus at tuskegee these supporters included members of the new middle class whose livelihood was based exclusively on a black market and black political and educational figures whose interests favored black constituencies the undoing of the postreconstruction dominant leadership was its accommodative policy in regard to civil and political rights the civil_rights leadership used this weakness very effectively to appeal to the uncommitted and the confused the course of history was on the side of the civil_rights leadership black people came to be disenfranchised and segregation became recodified the needs of black people grew ever more clearly to be those which the dominant leadership believed to be too radical to publicly advocate the needs were those of full civil and political rights thus the ascendancy of the civil_rights leadership to the dominant position was inevitable because this leadership recognized the more relevant needs of the time it had the courage to challenge the dominant leadership and it acted quickly and professionally to organize and institutionalize civil_rights sentiment and with the ascendancy of the civil_rights leadership came the ascendancy of the ideologies of assimilation the civil_rights leadership has met its responsibilities of fulfilling the need of black people for a reaffirmation of their citizenship rights and it is because of the success rather than failure of the civil_rights leadership that black people have today again given the first priorities to furthering black political and economic power and development for with rights won power can be developed economic and political development are two of the classic themes in black thought both intellectually and intuitively black people have always realized that economic and political power are the ultimate powers in american societywith an edge given to economic power for this reason many black people today look to the civil_rights organizations for leadership in these areas however while the civil_rights leaders can and even must assist black political and economic development they are neither structually nor ideologically equipped to provide direct leadership in these areas the organizations which provide the structural base for the civil_rights leadership are designed for and specialize in the vitally important areas of the elimination of discrimination legal aid and defense social welfare services voter registration and a wide range of other important services but because of its specialization the structural base of the civil_rights leadership does not lend itself to developing constructing and managing those black institutions that are needed for creating jobs generating wealth organizing and educating voters and providing the independent centers of strength necessary for empowering black people the dominant black leadership for implementing black political and economic power must come from elsewhere from other structures and from a different ideological orientation one example must suffice to illustrate the incompatibility of the assimilationist ideologies with the new needs and priorities of black people an exceedingly clear statement of this incompatibility comes from a book published last year by one of the foremost national civil_rights leaders speaking of housing programs he argued both rehabilitation and some new building in predominantly negro areas is immediately needed to alleviate inhuman conditions but this should be done without foreclosing possibilities of later integration emv u added the implied assumption of the necessity for integration for its own sake strikes to the heart of the contradiction between assimilationist ideologies and black_power development assimilationist ideologies attack the very foundation of black_power the black community this same leader goes on to clarify his point and remove any doubt about his true meaning the new and rehabilitated housing in ghetto areas should be temporary constructed for a relatively shortterm period of fifteen to twenty years units should be built with a plan to tear them down at the end of that period as housing integration is advanced aside from the question of the quality and the attractiveness of temporary housing not to mention the fact that black people have had experience with temporary housing before there remains the fact that housing is one of the most fundamental internal affairs and also the fact that for black people internal affairs are power affairs experience has shown that too few members of the majority group accept the offer of integration as posing a threat to the black political base but a more serious and immediate threat to black_power shows itself in a more subtle form many black civic and religious groups are sponsoring and controlling middle and lowincome housing developments but outside interests are being allowedpartly by default but also by invitationto come in the back door and economically exploit and control the black economic market created by the black housing development such invitations are a direct immediate and harmful consequence of assimilationist ideologies a leadership whose ideologies lead it to think in terms of literally tearing down black communities for the sake of integration and whose actionswhatever the intent threaten the political and economic base of the black community is not the leadership to occupy the dominant position the purpose here is not to condemn the past or the present efforts of the civil_rights leadership for indeed this leadership deserves praise for its invaluable contributions to the struggle neither is it implied that there is no longer a role for the civil_rights organizations for these organizations are centers of black_power in their own right and in their area of specialization and the demands and responsibilities upon them in the future will be even greater yet it was less than two years ago that stokely carmichael said black_power out loud and at the mere mention of the slogan a groundswell of black consciousness surfaced and clearly indicated that an old era was giving way to a new one as floyd mckissick noted at that time will go down in history as the year negroes became black people the classical ideological dualism in black thought has again brought black people to a major internal confrontation and into a period of transition and here it is well to note the wisdoms of what the civil_rights leaders themselves are fond of saying nothing is so powerful as an idea whose time has come the reemergence of black nationalist ideologies was inevitable because a nationalist approach to life in the united states is not only desirable but also practical american society has always been one in which groups have coexisted rather than assimilated this has never been a meltingpot society at least one of the themes in black thought has always tacitly recognized this it has taken the descendants of the immigrants longer to recognize the meltingpot myth but there are everincreasing indications that their third and fourth generations are becoming more nationalistic themselves intellectually black nationalism addresses itself to the cold and hard thinking and analysis necessary for economic and political development it recognizes the harsh realities facing an oppressed people and seeks to come to grips with them directly rather than by seeking to solve them by absorption into a hostile majority intellectually black nationalism looks to group rather than individual power and power in this society is a group enterprise whether the groups are racial or based upon socioeconomic class black leadership has been a sincere leadership but the present dominant leadership has made intellectual mistakes at the turn of the century the dominant leadership which was nationalistic made the intellectual mistake of assuming that black people could enjoy power without rights the dominant civil_rights leadership today seems to have made the mistake of assuming that rights in themselves are sufficient for reaping the fruits of power if todays civil_rights leadership knows better and most likely it does it has failed to enlighten many of its ideological followers both rights and power are always needed and in a society in which power is the quid pro quo of life a minority group should seek to maximize its power for the very reason that it is a minority black nationalism is perhaps even more relevant to the needs of black people in its emotional contributions to black thought nationalism seeks to show black people intellectually why and how they should struggle together it also seeks to instill the emotional reasons for wanting to struggle together it strives to create among black people feelings of selfrespect and mutual love and esteem black nationalism labors to foster a love for black companionship an appreciation for black culture and a joy in black living it is in these emotional qualities that black nationalism contributes to the struggle some of its best moments these moments soften the bitterness and hardships of the struggle and supports a faith in the potential of the struggle these emotional aspects of black nationalism are quite serious and represent one of its strongest forces of internal cohesion this warm emotional quality gives the particular form of nationalism that has evolved among black people a very positive character black nationalism is today a minor but growing sentiment among black people it first reappeared as a slogan then came to be recognized as a new concept and is now developing into a modern ideology that draws upon its tradition but adjusts to the present and the future black nationalism will grow ever stronger as it is given new definition and a wider base for it is one of the most intellectually and emotionally relevent ideologies present today yet the strongest argument for the inevitability of the continued rise of black nationalism is neither intellectual nor emotional this argument is simply that black nationalism is the product of social forces for black people are making socioeconomic and political progress and as black people advance the very structure of this society points to nationalism as the vehicle for further advancing black needs and interests this discussion must end as it began by noting that the new needs of black people will define the new responsibilities of black leadership therefore these responsibilities cannot be defined here except in the most general of terms the heart of this discussion is that in order for black leadership to meet its responsibilities of fulfilling the new needs and priorities that leadership must bring forth a new and compatible dominant ideology the parting suggestionand it is only a suggestion since we have not yet discovered absolutesis that the new ideology be in the classic tradition of black nationalism former lightheavyjnrrrj weight champ archie vv k moore warning of communist plans to foster race hatred in the united states told the house unamerican activities committee recently that he would fight the man who calls me an uncle tom it occurred to me that archie moore might well go on unclassified forever in the same week i read where whitey ne whitey young though considerably less handy with his fists boldly stood and told an audience of university of south carolina students that sncc and h rap brown are smalltime operators this set me thinking over possible solutions to a problem which long has puzzled soldiers of black equality in this country having recently been fired from a howard university professorship by a squad of uncle toms dr thomases if you please i quickly concluded that ways and means are now just as necessary to check and select our uncle toms as once was the case and is now to select and check our leadersif only to police the distinction between the two the first foil to confront me was of course the simple definition of an uncle tom websters intercollegiate dictionary defines this creature as one whose behavior toward whites is regarded as fawning or abjectly servile the difficulty sets in here of course in deciding at just what point a black fellows behavior is fawning or servile standards of tomism change with the times and what is radical today may fall tomorrow within the concept of baldfaced tomism it behooves each one of us to watch our steps and periodically check ourselves booker t washington who was once regarded by most black persons as a kind of messiah is now widely condemned as an uncle tom and the dye grows faster with each decade i remember some years ago falling out with a friend because i called booker t a tom too soon i suppose but the friend has written in years since to concur with my judgment when rev martin_luther_king jr was first catapulted into recognition by the montgomery movement a sister of mine bitterly chastised me for calling rev king a moderate at a time when the press and partly therefore the public which now recognizes him as a moderate seemed then to think that militant was his true first name today uncle toms may be divided into two main categories the utilitarian and the pathological from which might be developed a more detailed typology should anyone take the trouble to try the utilitarian toms identify with militancy to varying degrees hating the white mans guts but behave as they do for what they regard or at least claim to regard as practical or realistic motives or worse for personal gain this is the type most frequently encountered these days and is perhaps in many ways by far the most cunning and dangerous indeed lest our readers grow too smug a tenable case could be made out for the theory that the mass of silent blacks who while scorning to take aggressive stands as uncle toms bow down in apathy at best at worst in cringing docility themselves comprise as heavy an anchor as active tomism in submerging the struggle for black equality the pathological uncle tom is a true believer madly in love with the white race he has identified with the aggressor as psychoanalysts say he is to say the least a very sick man and cannot be helped much by an ordinary layman we grow too technical anyway one could just as easily quibble about the categories of body length about the exact point at which a man moves into the tall man range uncle toms too are relative and some toms naturally manage to out tom fellow toms the purpose promised in this brief essay is how to handle persons you yourself regard as uncle toms my rule of thumb is when interacting with a tom to keep my respectful distance though some of my best friends are toms and there are nice toms and impudent toms still a man has to be discriminating in his associates people are likely to link you with them despite a supreme court ruling to the contrary and yet a word about some tactics for using uncle tomsnever mind the interesting but less important means of tantalizing them our aim is to put toms to work for the black cause bringing their forces in a roundabout way to our side not to thicken the wall now standing between us granted that some toms are too far gone to be retrieved for the purposes i am about to propose and well do i know that it is a bit too hard to try to throw ones love about to everybody still there is i think a role for everybody to play hence the need to select our uncle toms or to put up some from our own ranks with strong enough stomachs to play the part then by some sort of remote control get them together with us at least maintain communication about their activities in relation to our own for instance we could agree that we will call a fellow and his project tomish before the press while he calls us extremist then we could retreat home and pour drinks in wait for his grant finally when once he receives his grant for a million dollars say he can give us about or so for apparatus guns gasoline science and mechanics books or whatever is your pleasure for our own program that way toms who plead devotion to the black cause in america could indicate to us whose side they are really on meanwhile black militants who face it are not known for their wealth could acquire much needed operating capital presently some unthinking black radicals some wearing processed hair religiously reject the idea of white financial support they seem to lose sight of the fact that money is green our fear is lest it should slowly turn red we must guard against being bought by money from any sourcewhite black or polka dottelling our donors that money given must come without tight strings i recognize the great inclination for subtle even unconscious submission to financial sources as well as the liability to dependence on the finances issued but this we must begin to overcome in any case white wouldbe controllers of black movements can entrap us no less by giving their money as some do now to black front sources who in turn may control our policies if we can be purchased by thick green this is not to mention the fact that the amount of money available in black sources at this time is very meager even black purses with perceptible bulges are too tightlipped to be opened very wide anyway bail money which black militants increasingly appear to need by the bale could be secretly paid by undercover militants posing as uncle toms and commendably this has already become a practice one black militant claims that his apparent passion for white women is really a pursuit on his part of one of them to take as a wife and place on the street to raise money and provide a social service for black militant brothers way out to be sure but how can we know that he is not on the level we cant not in the beginning but this is no need for unnecessary alarm we cannot be sure that the fiery black militant who recently joined our committee with a stunning african wardrobe an arabic name and the bushiest hair of all is not working for the man does your organizations authority on guerilla warfare with the plan to sock it to this country plan to turn your group in on a conspiracy charge after a couple of friendly conversations is a member of the fbi on your planning board could be this brings to mind another point a couple of years ago when my the black anglo saxons was published and i began to receive invitations to speak before audiences of strangers i was frequently a victim of this kind of misconception indeed many of my less educated black brethren seemed to feel threatened egowise and confused by the fact that i a howard professor identified with the black masses which unknown to them i was a part of by birth and upbringing you must be a fake one of them might shout during a postlecture exchange in the questionanswer period if you said that around howard you wouldnt be there long well i had been saying those things and more than ever since although governmental interference was later to help bring about my removal for such views still in the minds of the average black radical all howard professors were undeniably uncle toms other militants hold this view of government employees others of black policemen and detectives yet when the fbi infiltrated the kkk the kkk in turn infiltrated the fbi we need to infiltrate the fbi to have some idea of the nature of their knowledge and infiltration of us are we not as sophisticated as the klan all of this is not to deride afro hairdos and abus both of which i possess but my point is that any police force worth its salt contains a body of plain clothesmen there is no need for whites to be able to look at us and tell what we think by the way we dress we need some secretary in the pentagon wearing a blond wig and well known as a trusted tomor is it sally so that an order from lbj to send troops to detroit could be mistyped misplaced or delayed ever so slightly to give the brothers a bit more time the supply of spiesonce armageddon arrivesmust come from the ranks of those who somehow have retained trustworthy relations and the ability to communicate with otherwise wary white enemies to shut off all contacts is to sever a lethal cord of eventual subversion the more we get together in a spatial separation desirable as that is the more subject we areunless there are those lurking as enemies withinto fall victim to air raids and bombings in an allout war not only could the whites drop an atom bomb on us we would be even by land left vulnerable to a noose of white troops surrounding and decimating us the advantages of hanging on to some inside positions though again i must be brief for fear of revealing too much was apparent when a few years back the lights went out in the new york area leaving a city helpless and stranded in the darkness of suspended elevators and blackedout streets authorities sought vainly for an explanation some going so far as to suggest that god did it undoubtedly some colored night watchman pulled that switch or so he could have all of the foregoing is representative of our new and untapped potential for togetherness power a far far preferable replacement for the present smokescreen of unity or oneness there isrepeata role for everyone to play just as on a football field there are quarterbacks fullbacks halfbacks guards and tackles the same principle holds true for any collective endeavor and in the words of karl marx the revolutionary communist theoretician e very little bit helps in a sense recently however a black radical friend of mine quoted marx to refute my proposal for corralling and yoking uncle toms claiming that marx would regard them as counterrevolutionaries who should be swiftly purged i replied that while it is true that there are similarities between russian uncle toms of yore and black uncle toms marx was not writing about us colored folks of todays world and ill fight the man who says that i am tomming to uncle toms born of africa j tf born of her soil her i rhythms her multi jy tudes i was queen of egypt and bushman peasant wife i roamed the forests of the congo and the rivers nile and zambesi i saw the travels of many an equatorial sun but most of all i was a woman a black woman in love with the black manhood of the world the mother of black children the baker of the bread however high our civilizations rose however primitive our villages in the eyes of the west however strange the pale ghost faces of those who invaded us my dedication was to him to the black man and to all things pertinent to his well being i cooked for him and bathed his feet and bore him children i laughed at his jokes and stood silent and believing when he spoke of his dreams i was proud and walked with a swaying to my hips which brought delight to his handsome black face i was straight in my stance and i looked up to him for all my needs we were a people a proud black people the rulers of our own lives and when the sun was low and he sat beside the door of our home with fatigue in his eyes i danced for him and gave him much pleasure till the sun should rise again then came the marches i remember the march across the land the first of the marches we stretched out in a great line as far as the eye could see and mixed with lion howls and cheetah screams there persisted the bonerubbing bloodcrusted chainclanking of white imposed slavery my husband stumbled amidst the chains ahead of me and my pregnant sister marched behind i remember well that the only times we were allowed to stop beneath the lashing whips while the sun was still high in the sky were on the occasions of sickness striking some person in the line we stopped on such a day one week away from the day we started marching it was to unshackle my sister from the chains her ninth month had come too soon the labor of birth had begun its timeless stroke a white slave driver threw her to the ground kicked her so hard i could hear the thud above her screams and then ordered us to leave her lying with her heaving labor alone on the earth where some kind scavenger might sink its teeth into her throat her husband cried out in anguish his leg irons dragging the ground and his wrists scarred to bleeding with his efforts to reach her he fell to his knees pleading that they leave him with her if both could not go i remember well now during sinister sleepless nights the sound of the white machete as it sung through the air and cut open his heart we marched and we died we were lashed and driven like beasts despite it all west africa awaited us the prisons on the gold coast awaited us of every among us who lived of us died among them my husband my brother my sister my mother my sons and one wellgrown girlchild my heart turned to a stone harder than some may ever know and through the stone of my heart the white men tried to chisel the art of sewing and broken english and how to bow and scrape and shuffle to the tune of yas suh and no suh i learned nothing and obeyed for my lifes sake the boats came i was packed like a bag of sop into the stinking hold most of my village was there inside that floating hole in the dark there was no air no toilet no place to move we lay shackled together amidst the stench of death for months on a tossing sea and we died again one after the other we mutinied and some of us fed ourselves to the sharks rather than remain slaves finally when our numbers had dwindled to onefifth our beginnings we landed in america in that great land of the free and home of the brave for me from the beginning of my american sojourn it has been the land of the greedy and the home of the slave for years i was americas physical slave and for almost more white america owned my mind two hundred years of my backs free labor turned swamps into fertile lands and forests into bales of cotton and cotton into northern factories and mills for years i suffered the brainwash from white mouths which beat me into acting the servantslave i sowed my best of labor music invention and faith and i reaped the racists raping knife i was taught christianity and armed with my new faith i sought to love again for so long a time i had no other hope i put my trust in jesus and all in all i was a better christian than my white teachers i prayed and i kept the faith while i lived in the american hell i met a man a slave like me and according to the white christian law of that time i married him by jumping over a broomstick among our friends i would have liked a preacher but this was not to be allowed all my pastafrica my native language uraba kamba masia my family my friends of long beforewas lost and tom from my memory the past was gone to here and now i summoned all my courage to begin again we had four children my husband and i his love was a balm to all my pain ill never forget the day when the white mistress at the big house raped him for her own and on the morning when my oldest child was eight the white man who owned us all sold us all each to a different place each to hell knows where they freed us lincoln sitting in his noble chair white father of all black children leaned down like god and told me i was free he told me to run gaily in freedom not noticing the white scars which marked the places where my legs had once been when i crawled out onto the world and looked at the white fathomless sea washing against and over me i saw nothing but horror despite the one or two kind white hands which reached out to help me i saw nothing but a lonesome horror but somehow through the years lonely and misused by panting white men i held on i saw many a black sister fall but i held on again in i married he a beautiful black man dark like africa young and courageous like the african lions in my past he gave me patience and hope to run beside my ugly bitterness he gave me love and tenderness to bolster my sagging vision of the world i was able to get jobs and he could not i wore the pants because he could not i saw him shrivel up like some castoff fruit for some time you could find my husband in harlem or bedford stuyvesant or white plains lying drunk with despair and liquor in the alley behind some shambled building or sitting with a dullness in his eyes behind some southern white house or lynched perhaps in your home town hanging to a tree or burning on a stake driven into the ground you could find one of my sons on some street corner in a dorag afraid to hope and ready to kill you could find my other son sleeping beside some fabled white chick thrilled to touch her pale superhuman flesh there was a time when my daughter was raped of all that was precious and then left to cry with no one to hear there was a time when you could find me scrubbing white floors washing white clothes cooking white food and mammying white babies with a studied attention far greater than the love i was supposed to give to my own children there was a time when i watched my husband cry into his hands as his children looked to me for bread and spending change i saw his manhood beaten and denied by a country which scorned him put its big foot on his head and ground down its heel while the owner of the foot shouted nigger there must be law and order nigger always obey the law nigger i saw every last one of us sitting by and crying and biding our time while we died every hour of every day and lived on white vomit and wished to god and satan that we were white but all that has changed for us now though some of my black brothers and sisters are still in the mire that has changed for my black family and me now the fires have come to burn the white sickness the healing fires have come i will bide my time here no more its time i turned back to loving and delighting my own my patience with the centuryold system is gone now its gone away with the thudding of the years and the dripping of my lifes blood i will wish to be white no more now i will fry my hair no more bleach my face no more for the final glow of pure sweet whiteness has faded to tarnish i see who i am now and who my man is we have begged and worked in vain too long i wont lose my husband and sons and daughters again nor will they let me be lost i am a black woman and again i have found my original pride i will stand with my black man and my blackness wherever it is found to love him to give him my strength is my total reason to be again and if it means that i must rewrite my history despite those who wrote me out of it if it means i must never sleep however long the hours and if i must bleed again and suffer scorn again i will gain my freedom my black man will be free and if it means at that point in time when the white wall will not give way and we cant push without applying a final terrible fire that i must stand beside that man of mine and follow him fiercely toward the way to white and black oblivion having found the essence of myself this black woman will not turn back the very highest y praise is inadequate in l paying tribute to the late dr_king the man was indeed a king among men successful and sensitive crusader resourceful and persuasive teacher courageous exemplar of nonviolence in the united states eloquent spokesman for the cause of justice freedom peace and humanistic ideals for all men a religious leader with a deep and abiding faith in and steadfast commitment to the essential brotherhood of all mankind author and orator of classic quality whose words were filled with resounding impact and challenge alterconscience of a nation plagued and torn by the invidious distinctions of class and the pernicious divisions of race these all too briefly are some of the accolades identified with martin_luther_king jr many of his accomplishments of a short years attest to his extraordinary stature in the world chronicles of social and political relations in the united states regardless of perspective will certainly rank him as one of the most influential americans of the th century as regards especially moral issues legislation for civil_rights and social progress for the disadvantaged he exerted a farreaching and profound impact on the consciousness of the american people none of his contemporaries matched his combined efforts in all of the areas mentioned here and especially those extended for the ultimate causes of mans struggle freedom from oppression as well as to realize opportunity and fulfillment justice in the rewards and relationships of human endeavor and humanity as dignity and selfesteem as well as reason and responsibility dr_king was a studious and studied man of letters author of five books and contributor to several additional ones he has had still others written about him and his work his writing reflects penetrating insight and wide scholarship there is also the vast as yet uncounted number of essays articles speeches sermons published interviews letters and other communications of record in their own special way each skillfully appeals to the intellect the imagination and the emotion as to other credentials major american universities recognized him with both earned and honorary degrees he received awards from numerous civic agencies for his contributions to american life as orator rev king had few peers many of his speeches will long be remembered and analyzed for both content and style the most memorable perhaps is his address at the march on washington in a rising crescendo of emotion and on the refrain i had a dream he challenged the nation to rise up and live out its creed of equality for all men the last one in memphis as if in eerie premonition of his imminent demise gave clear expression to the belief that ultimately it is the purpose and fullness of life rather than its length and possessions which give it significance and provided the lasting measures of a man dr_king traveled widely and attracted worldwide attention throush his valiant efforts in the service of others increasingly he was being looked to as the most promising spiritual or moral leader of his time more than a great negro or american he was regarded as a great man of the world he went on to further renown after his international acclaim in when he became the youngest man ever to win the nobel peace prize at age unparalleled as a civil_rights leader he was one of a rare number of famous men who had the ear of presidents yet retained the common touch for reaching the masses of his people and many of goodwill of other races as well having many of the qualities of moses and gandhicourage steadfastness in the face of adversity selfless devotion to freedomhe might well have equalled their successes to the extent of winning freedom for his people if death had not come at such an early age the charisma and capacity for empathy which he had virtually would have assured this he achieved identity with the unlettered sharecropper as well as the learned scholar with the woman in the slum flat as well as in the suburban bungalow to the radical and militant he seemed mild and moderate to the forces of reaction he was radical but his commitment was crystal clear and unyielding detractors notwithstanding in his book why we cant wait he articulated the significance of his nonviolent course and cause as the able philosopher astute tactician and ardent supporter of nonviolence in america his special blend of courage style and mastery of the technique of confrontation with his adversaries served as a vital buffer between at the extreme the forces of nihilism with its accompanying violence from blacks and those of reaction and racism with their violence from whites three brief statements from his writings help to capture the essence of his philosophy which is based on the enduring law of love that the way to humanity and community is through the creative understanding of and redemptive goodwill for ones fellowman in strength to love he instructed we must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system and thereby to become a participant in its evil and through nonviolent resistance we shall be able to oppose the unjust system and at the same time love the perpetrators of the system for the expected outcome his account of the montgomery bus boycott in stride toward freedom is most revealing the aftermath of nonvio lence is the creation of the beloved community one in which friendship and understanding can prevail tragically however like the great soul gandhi rev king was victimized by the very incapa ft a i city of some to grasp the significance of his message about violence its brutality inhumanity irrationality and inexorably its ultimate futility the irretrievable loss of his bulletrained death in stealth and cowardice has its expected ignominy the king assassination stands as a symbol of the segregated society and its breeding of hatred racism and violence against which he so valiantly struggled if we are to find solace and sustenance amidst the void created by his murder we can look to his service commitment love and good works few men ever leave such a rich and varied legacy as has dr_kingideas ideals and values organizational efforts inspirational and worldwide interests these and more form the main part of his treasury for america indeed for the ages nonviolence and brotherhood selflessness and humility along with the other praiseworthy values recounted here will continue to be linked with his lifes work and aspirations some basic foundations of his thinking are sketched in the shortest and perhaps least known of his books the measure of a man although they are encountered in more elaborate form in his other writings in it he expresses basic beliefs about the purpose meaning and dimensions of life its potential rests on the boundless reservoir of mental moral and material strength which lies within the grasp of each unique human personality from this man develops the capacity to triumph with positive virtues and values in the fact of apparent weakness and even in defeat perhaps his experience and eventual disengagement in the albany georgia protests of and in his chicago efforts of to launch and sustain the movement in the north are cases in point by drawing from the reservoir hope can be retained under conditions of despair love can be evoked in the face of hate he makes it clear that when hate and despair prevail men fall victim to frustration disillusionment alienation or to an even more pathetic conditionthat of violence and destruction the full life then is one in which there is a combination of positive virtues and values with strong commitment and action that results in the reconciliation of high order principles with practice of idealistic rhetoric with reality only two of dr_kings organizational efforts are mentioned although he made contributions to others and his name is linked indelibly with organized demonstrations and campaigns for social change in cities of the north as well as the south considering their initiative timing import and successes dr_kings work with the montgomery improvement association founded in and the southern christian leadership conference founded in can be consid ered a noteworthy monument under his leadership as president the former provided the coordination and support for the successful bus boycott in that city see stride toward freedom this was an important victory because it built solidarity among the negro community led to a change in the laws of segregation and proved the efficacy of the boycott as an instrument of progress in the social economic and political life of negroes his prominence eventually transferred to the southern christian leadership conference of which he was also the first president and brought it to the forefront among the major civil_rights groups especially in the south it attacked the problems of discrimination and injustice through voter registration basic and citizenship education selfhelp programs of economic and political action and other means of nonviolent protest in summary several perspectives gleaned from his writings are instructive as suggested by the following develop a full measure of spiritual power and moral leadership for that is the path to virtue be right and resolute use reason and restraint in the struggle for freedom for these noble means carry dignity consistent with such a worthy end strive for harmony and unity in the complex and interdependent relations that make up the human condition for the whole part of man and society and must work in concert in order to realize their full potential achieve both material and spiritual sustenance in the pursuit of love and the values that sustain us in a healthy viable mental and physical state of wellbeing for that is required in developing the dimensionslength breadth and heightof the complete life these are but few of the goals and guides to be drawn from the king legacy they are extensions of his contributions in making his precepts and examples livable and believable all exerted an obvious and pervasive influence in his own life and beliefs these and other teachings he has offered to us they have been implanted in the national body politic as his challenges have been on the national conscience but like all teachings and challenges it is up to the taught to learn and use them up to the challenged to make them opportunities and benefit from them finally the insight and prophetic quality of much that dr_king expressed should serve us the living in shaping the future of life in america we have reached the crossroads of our journey as a society condoning segregation injustice and racism those marked the other way are routes leading to violence destruction and inhumanity those marked the king way are upgrading routes leading to nonviolence construction and humanity in the title of his book he posed the question which each of us must answer in some way since our own destiny will be touched by the collective answer that is finally given where do we go from here chaos or community if the answer is community dr_king in paying the supreme sacrifice to gain for blacks freedom from an environment impoverished by white oppression and for whites freedom from an environment impoverished by their own hypocrisy and racism will not have died in vain the work of martin_luther_king jr was for the good of america and mankind taken away in the vibrant fullness of manhood by his loss both america and mankind are the less his death diminishes us all because we too are involved in the work of america and mankind yet we the living can be working still we must be for the system the way of lifethe hatewhich produced the murderer holds us all in peril dr_king offered an alternative it is in his path by his creed through lovethat we shall be free at last free at last that we shall overcome letter from a black girl the rages in me now are j dangerous i am fully jl s aware of the crises the danger but i still feel the rage it rocks me totally unlike the soothing rock i was not mentally cognizant of as a babe comforted in the weight of my aunts arms i walk torn by grief bitterness depression and periodic depths of sheer hopelessness i walk into my office surrounded by white faceswhite laughing faces white apathetic facesand i drink water from a fountain surrounded by black faces black laughing faces black apathetic faces and i scream inside do you care white face do you care black face do you shed tears that the man died because all he wanted to do was help somebody somebody like you and me and i cant stand the pain it shoots through me like electricity and i scream outoh god im burning inside give me some water to quench this flame but there is not enough water in the mississippi to kill this conflagration there are not enough extinguishers to stop this burning it is growing and it is frightening me i pray for strength i must pray for strength because when i hear that white face saying oh thats too bad and i hear that black face saying oh thats too bad the effrontery is too unbearable i then know that the words of the man and the words of the apathetic smilers must make a nobody like me a somebody whose bones will ache trying to do something it seems to me that the beginning is to honestly care thus im posed with the problem of what to do what can i do i have to do something i cannot live with myself look at my plain face in the mirror and as without conscience do nothing the bell has sounded it shook me like an earthquake the lightning has struck and drenched me with care and i lay limpnever again to be the same how could i possibly be the sameunless i am an android with the reading off off flashing in my mechanical heart the point is that there is not enough action after the temporary overpowering feelings subside the constructive anger dissipates too quickly the tears dry too fast and we are our old selves too soon and it is the old selvesthe old souls that have to be washed over and over in the blood of those who die for us one would think that some bodies would start washing their own souls one would think that some bodies would be tired of the aching hands tirelessly scrubbing at them one would think that some bodies would start caring about some bodies other than their own we really act like androids waiting for someone to push our button we are the greatest beings in the worldgreat at watching great at listening and agreeing and the greatest at forgetting we just love to see others sweat and die for us what is ita kick a narcotic it seems to me its about time for cold turkey we are so insincerely touched today its pathetic and so untouched tomorrow its more pathetic what is the formula for caring sunday and not caring monday yes im in a rage and i want it shared i am appalled because not enough bodies move when a scream of help is heard in the night not enough individual human concern reaches those in need we are too busy playing bridge and golf sipping cocktails and watching the idiot box how long will fools be fools we ought to be ashamed of our parts in this cancerous society our bodies ought to be imprisoned caged like the feelings in our hearts what are we going to do the man went up to the mountain top and crossed over for us but how long will each of us smell his fragrance portrait of young writers in a workshop for chicagos obac organization of black american culture w writers workshop literature is a truly lively art for more than a year the pursuit of literary reflection of the black experience has animated the writers and their weekly sessions during this summer the workshop will publish the first of a projected series of anthologies called nommo including the work of workshop members future publications also will include the work of young writers not affiliated with the workshop during the past year two members of the workshop have published collections of their own he obac writers workshop is not just another writers workshop it has a special aim and orientation reflecting the general principles of the parent body the organization of black american culture in its statement of purposes the workshop presents the following outline the writers workshop of the organization of black american culture is a communityoriented unit with the general aim of seeking out and encouraging the literary talent within the black community beyond that the workshop strives toward the conscious development and articulation of a black aesthetic and the following goals are inherent in this larger one the encouragement of the highest quality of literary expression reflecting the black experience the establishment and definition of the standards by which that creative writing which reflects the black experience is to be judged and evaluated the encouragement of the growth and development of black critics who are fully qualified to judge and evaluate black literature on its own terms while at the same time cognizant of the traditional values and standards of western literature and fully able to articulate the essential differences between the two literatures poet gwendolyn brooks works very closely with members of the workshop encouraging them to try their wings in any direction they feel inclined to fly in the spring she contributed toward the publication of the groups anthology nommo the famed poet also frequently entertains the writers at informal gatherings in her home inviting them to meet distinguished artists and writers who are her guests while appearing locally in his hit musicaldrama golden boy sammy davis jr donated to the workshop and promised another during the year workshop members however are not merely on the receiving end last winter for example they organized a benefit for poet leroi jones convicted of guncarrying charges during last years rebellion in newark the funds will be used to help mr jones pay the costs of his appeal the workshop which has an opendoor policy receives visitors during its regular sessions and invites aspiring writers to read from their works and to join the freewheeling discussions the writers also go out into the community reading for young people at community centers and for adults at taverns and churches they have organized a speakers bureau to coordinate appearances before groups locally and nationally hoyt w fuller one of the founders of obac acts as chairman of the writers workshop leo proudhammer age and his older brother caleb had just watched their parents dance merrily to a calypso it had been a rare occasion in which the proudhammer parenis transcended their sorrow the terms of their existence in americaand discovered briefly the joy that comes with owning ones own life they were smiling writes james baldwin in tell me how long the trains been gone dial press an indescribable smile moments later daddy proudhammer in the process of clicking the radio dial away from the news is asked by his eldest son now dont you want to know whats happening in the world to which his father responds no aint no white boy living can tell me whats happening in the world not before they find out whats happening on my job it is not to be sure the novels most dramatic or exciting scenebut it is nonetheless illustrative of the powerful symbolism and imagery at work throughout this story about one black mans struggle to overcome the definition of himself handed down by his white countrymen which he accomplishes fairly quickly and his longer more difficult struggle to accept that self which rests beneath the mask of color and to discover finally something actual about the human condition one is not aware of a black actor on the american scene with as great a depth as the novels hero actor leo proudhammer however one is aware of james baldwin who because his is the voice of an unusually civilized mind in this primitive land may indeed be our greatest writer and who without question has written the most important novel of this crucial decade in american history it is precisely that american historythe ugly facts which one yet seeks to deny and which moreover prove difficult to comprehend when revealedthat must be accepted if one is to consider the life of leo proudhammer and not as his story unfolds feel menaced by its utterly painful comments upon ones own life enter the novel by way of suffering with proudhammer a heart attack enter sailing as it were on the recognizable waves of baldwins prose into the pain of an actor made famous rich and notorious because he cast himself into a love role rather than remain our kind of actorcast by directors one despises into roles one hates proudhammer takes us back to the harlem of his boyhood where we discover him to be an avid listener a sensitive youth who very early makes the allimportant connection between better acting and wisdom he learns early the art of allowing others that most desperate of needs the belief that they are winning and perceives that what is routinely dismissed as good luck is nothing other than the product of ones own cunning all of which provides him with vision beyond the garment center that claimed his father and at first appears to have invested in him an unshakeable confidence but which upon further examination turns out to be nothing more than temerity enough to carry him from the inherited degradation of harlem to a selfimposed romantic degradation in the village that further examination occurs when key actor proudhammer hardly challenged by harlem or the village attends with his white friend barbara an uptown theatrical party where he encounters a better actor than himself the party as an event in literature might prove as devastating to any number of readers as it could have been in the life of leo proudhammer on the stage of life in a very real sense for the first time proudhammerat the mercy of a white directoris dragged to the bottomless sea of his own bitterness it is the moment in which he makes that much avoided but gravely essential discovery that he too is vulnerable can be had can in fact drown and is without means of securing his life raft except by paying that historic price which price is coming to terms with the rage that is his own rage that pretended to sleep but it never slept the merest touch of a feather was enough to bring it howling roaring out it had no sight no measure no precision and no justice and it was my master still as baldwin has written elsewhere how painful it is to repeat these words that haunted the reviewer throughout his foolish years the question of color operates to hide the graver questions of the self proudhammer survives his rage and one comes upon him a hungry cat still years and much hard work away from fame standing on an empty stage in an empty theater at an actors workshop in new jersey i looked out at the dark spooky theatervery spooky now with the rain roaringand wondered if my destiny could be involved in such a place but destinies as i was beginning to discover are strangeand must be being so mysteriously hung up with desire for i desired i realized one dayif these bones could liveto stand here before those living with whom i would fill this dusty void and hear them bearing witness as i now heard the sound of the rain i had never before thought of my desire as a reality involving others neither had i thought of others as needing my desire but i now for the first time in that dusty barn suspected that this coupling defined ones destiny and that on this coupling depended the mysterious life of the world i was young perhaps it is hard now to credit still less to sound the depth of my bewilderment i merely suspected in the chilling height the dusty roaring darkness the presence of others each of whom was myself but these others could not know it and neither could i unless i was able being filled by them to fill this theater with our lives this was perhaps my highest possibility of the act of love in this era of lovelessness out of the heart and guts of james baldwin comes a rejoicingly beautiful novel that seeks not to appease any taxpayer in this republic black or white who victimized by selfestrangement would honor only that work which legitimizes ones own curious version of the american fantasy or ones own fantasylike version of the american reality to experience this novel really is to experience proudhammers love which is perhaps asking a little much of the same public that held in contempt rufus from another country and one can already hear the voices shouting proudhanvner alas as though one could have as it were the dune without a mighty wind one might for a starter find proudhammer unlovable because of his long meaningful relationship with a white woman seeking solace in the illusion that in denying proudhammers history one escapes ones own so long however as one persists in believing that the tragedy in which these or or million nobody really knows were conceived way back there on the plantation can be attributed to pigmentation or genes rather than the absence of love one remains albeit heterosexual a perverted lover of the opposite race which brings one to a consideration of bisexual proudhammers homosexual relationships conjuring in the american imagination as indeed nigger pot god and all else that one has not understood has conjured images of a hell more painful more deadly and more eternal than that which one has accepted as ones life sentence on this planet my own instinct asserts proudhammer as to the male relation is that men who are far more helpless than women because far less singlemindedneed each other as comrades need each other for correction need each other for tears and ribaldry need each other as models need each other indeed in sum in order to be able to love women one is not certain what in fact a homosexual is but one is afraid that american men are all finally faggots forbidden to touch each other because the very idea of loving each other imposes upon ones imagination an experience more incomprehensible more guilty and more heartless than the sad affairs through which one so recklessly seeks that much heralded and elusive quality called manhood if in fact the acceptance of rufus required as one suspects coming to terms with americas base cruelty the acceptance of proudhammer requires of one a face with which to confront the source of that cruelty americas profound stupidity for unlike rufus who was unable to withstand this land where one is hardly out of grammar school before plotting ones own death proudhammer outdistances the national mediocrityi had had it among all these deadly and dangerous people who made their own lives and all the lives they touched so flat and stale and joyless my countrymen impressed me simply as being on the whole the emptiest and most unattractive people in the world it seemed a great waste of ones only lifetime to be condemned to their chattering vicious pathetic hysterically dishonest company there were other things to do other people to see there was another way to live and it is in his toughness where insight is seemingly endless that one might find ones own dreaded weakness the man who some time ago insisted upon his right to criticize america perpetually because he loves her seems to understand along with so few others that years is but a fraction of history a moment in mans evolution and some years ago one is reminded a system prevailed in this land that must be calledas no man can denybarbaric men politicians with no more vision than those of ones own day in the middle of that tragic era assured themselves in the act of writing a beautiful document that despite the inhuman institution to which they committed their lives they could in social terms salvage their humanity they died indeed as they lived fools and their descendentsblack and white liberal and conservative nationalists and integrationists bigots and paternalists revolutionaries and uncle toms cling desperately and with much timidity to the myth of their creation for not very many people in america have begun to understand as james baldwin so eloquently stated in at least two essays everybodys protest novel many thousands gone included in the collection notes of a native son that the reality of man as a social being is not his only reality one might wish in the confusion of a day in which writersmen who do not for one moment imagine themselves able to lead another to the promised landare expected to perform the perfectly awful rituals of the popularity contest that baldwin had plotted a novel in which the recipe out of the mess read as clearly as reads the back of a cake box but the mess which is precisely ones own life has ever been more complex than ones most daring wish and it is in just such a wish that one misses the point of the novel the pain of the novelist that he must write out of his experience and moreover in that same wish one misses as baldwin has reminded us the point of oneself that one can only face in others that which one faces in ones self james baldwin in tell me how long the trains been gone explored that phenomenon one thinks oneself incapable of as reflected in the vain attempts to dismiss it as irrelevant yet not even the extraordinary delusion rampant in america has convinced any among her inhabitants that anything save love will spare this nation the fate that awaits any people whose sense of human life is defined by the sword the once symbolic fire has become visible can one accept this novels fury terror rage hatred and finally its love as ones own there can be one hazards only one american dream to struggle out of this nightmare perhaps it isnt after all impossible however as james baldwin remarked a few months ago ignorance is in the saddle here and we ride mankind and ignorance it must be noted is either colorless or multicolored david llorens hould retain billyboy after we take over the schools we asked why and after we heard the usual things about how long folks have been reading him and how much she enjoyed midsummer nights dream she said he was just valuable and why the devil didnt we quit questioning gods anyway we pointed out that leroi jones has said the black man is making new gods not only spiritual but economical political organizational and in every way including literatural we only wanted to know what bill shakespeare with his racist overandundertones hashad done for the black community and her answer was nothing should a people revere a literature that has done nothing for them should a people support endeavors that do not benefit them recently in negro digest dudley randall and don l lee had a similar discussion should artists support artistic endeavors that do not benefit their people and who makes that determination these are some of the questions we had while reading curling houghton mifflin the second novel by robert boles one other possible title could have been one of dem we are disappointed when we see talented young writers engaging in meaningless discussion about how weve just got to adjust to this american situation three novels have been published this season dealing with the need to be accepted by white people or the justification for loving their women this is not only unfortunate it is unacceptable it discourages our people from reading dick and jane and up the hill to get a pail of water is not zeeley and chuch othello and up against the wall scarlett is not vyry the flagellants arent whos afraid of virginia woolfe and we need to be engaged in making that distinction any artist can only articulate whether with pen or brush or clay etc what he is and feels and knows boles has done this he like all americans has a dream and that dream is that america adopt chelsea a nigger into its rich white family that dream is that chelsea a poor black boy replace the older white son who had once mistreated a black woman and he attempts to explain how all this is possible how allen chelseas younger brother does care about him how his father did do and would do the right thing how his fathers wife who would not allow him to call her mother will grow to love and accept him in time he takes us through chelseas endless wealth his endless love for a white woman who would you believe doesnt love him the endless abuse he suffers because they dont understand that he is just like them and finally to his ultimate justification for killing another poor black man the murder is central to the theme because chelsea does not want to kill a poor colored man but is compelled to kill if he is to continue playing the life game called white like them chelsea journeys to upper new england after his rejection which is probably final by that white woman he loves he vows never to go back to his family since they so obviously dont want him but the longer he stays the longer he has to long for his old way of life shades of the happiest slave in the world he needs a reason to call upon them question how can i get the family to be involved with me answer cause a disturbance question what should i do answer kill someone result the family came to the rescue result he can remain rich though rejected result two black men dead result an unfortunate book we are always disappointed when we see talented young writers engaging in meaningless discussion to justify their refusal to be free now that its written we hope mr boles will literally explore other possibilities available to him nikki giovanni the coffee house ministry by john d perry jr published by john knox press at is a very timely and helpful book it speaks of the christian churchs effort to come of age in our time this movement is ecumenical and integrated and is a new and effective means for the church to perform the service to mankind that it was commissioned to do by jesus christ the cogent ideas of our time must have a forum and this book explains in detail how this has been attempted by the coffee house ministry it is certainly a must for any who desire to attempt this work james e woodruff i in most of our history we get the upper side of history in american history we get the europeans who came and took the land and killed the indians and brought millions of blacks here to slavery but we dont get the story of the indians and the negroes tom haydens rebellion in newark random housevintage gives us the underside of the newark uprising the official story is that negroes rioted against law and order looted and burned and were finally brought under control by the forces of law and order tom hayden who has been a community organizer in newark since tells the story from the point of view of the negroes in a brief book most of which appeared previously in the review new york review of books conditions in newark were among the worst of any large city in the country it had the nations highest percentage of bad housing the most crime per people the heaviest per capita tax burden the highest rates of venereal disease maternal mortality and new cases of tuberculosis it was trying to squeeze out the negro population by creating a acre medical school in the ghetto the mayor refused to appoint a fully qualified negro to an educational post and tried to appoint a political crony instead the uprising was touched off by the arrest and the beating of a taxi driver by the police it began wednesday and continued into thursday young people tore open liquor and furniture stores and other people poured into them community organizers felt violence could not be halted and urged that burning of buildings be held down to save lives the burning was confined to not more than buildings the looting had virtually stopped by friday when the state troopers and the national guard were called in if the purpose was to prevent looting they could have stationed small detachments in front of business places to protect them instead they drove through the streets in a war against the black community their actions were punitive it was then that the sniping began the police troopers and guardsmen were panicky and would rake entire buildings when a sniper fired this indiscriminate shooting killed innocent persons in their homes some of the white casualties may have also been caused by this panicky firing the police beat up black policemen reporting at the police station police troopers and guardsmen beat robbed and killed black citizens they looted and shot out the win dows of black business places thereby losing the support of the black middleclass perhaps the most important part of the book is chapter v in which hayden discusses the use of violence in the civil_rights struggle he says it is not just an overturning of law and order for law and order do not exist in the ghetto but it must be considered by civil_rights activists as a possible new strategy after the failure of politics nonviolent demonstrations and community organization to be effective it must not be sporadic as before but must be disciplined and organized and should be applied if only by paintbrush where it can cause a crisis among oppressive forces and give people the courage to demand changes and force consideration of a new system this is not a definitive account of the newark rebellion but it should be read because it tells the side which is usually untold and discusses the possibilities of violence where other means of redress have faileddudley randall at a time when american soldiers are fighting and dying in vietnam it is good to remind ourselves of the differences between bravery and heroism this service hardly limits the value of episodes of the revolutionary war by the recently murdered ernesto che guevara international publishers paper but if you have been brainwashed into thinking negatively about castros cuba justify your curiosity with this service in mind bravery is simply the encountering of known risks heroism is fighting for a purpose and against the odds castro guevara and other men did just that when they left mexico on november on a sevenday seasick voyage in the tiny granma they were the entire cuban rebel army and they had rifles five days after they landed at playa de las coloradas the dictator batistas soldiers and air force attacked them only men survived then they faced over two years of marching with infected feet sleeping outdoors starving fighting superior numbered and armed forces succumbing to tropical diseases and discovering deadly traitors like eutimio guerra who accepted the shelter of castros blanket one night armed with a and planning to kill the rebels leader his cowardice alone prevented him from pulling the trigger heroes fight for an ideal of nationhood and against an evil they can clearly define as the revolution grew che wrote no one can say exactly when in this long process the ideas became reality and we became a part of the peasantry as far as i am concerned the contact with my patients in the sierra turned a spontaneous and somewhat lyrical decision into a more serene force one of an entirely different value later he saw welleducated revolutionaries lose their touchiness and become united with the peasants they fought for and he observed that the revolution cleanses men improving and developing them as the farmer corrects the defects on a plant and brings out its best qualities he gives us fascinating portraits of castro to whom we felt tied by a bond of romantic sympathy for adventure and the thought that it would be worthwhile to meet death on a foreign beach for so pure an ideal castro lost time and money to free che from jail where mexican police and fbi and dominican dictator trujillos spies had joined to put him right before the granma was scheduled to sail leave me behind che had requested i will not forsake you castro told che who later wrote that such personal gestures by fidel towards those he loves are the key to the strong devotion created around him where a feeling of loyalty based on principle is added loyalty based on friendship making the cuban rebel army an indivisible whole these personal episodes however are scattered sparsely in the book which makes them all the more moving the bulk of the little book documents the realities of guerrilla warfare the synthesis of which from the guerrillas standpoint is constant mobility constant mistrust and constant vigilance for the enemy noted che is magnificently protected although only willing to fight at a safe distance from comfortable positions and against an opponent practically defenseless much the same way as the colonists had fought the indians in the west of the united statesjohn woodford you have heard of books being keys to other books eg the key to finnegans wake right well this book william styrons nat turner ten black writers respond beacon press is the key to styrons unfortunate confessions of nat turnera key yes but with this difference not a key to open a door but to lock one this book is the key that locks the white liberal up in an empty meaningless and sterile room which is his white mind and history once this door is locked suffocation is the only alternative for there are no open windows no back doors to this room as a key then this book is invaluable invaluable also for some very practical reasons first there is in the appendix the complete text of nat turners confession as recorded by thomas gray second there is a variety of information regarding the historical facts and third there is a great variety of different perspectives ie the historical psychological literary political linguistic etc on the subject of nat turner in the introductory essay john henrik clarke quotes from the historian herbert aptheker historys potency is mighty the oppressed need it for identity and inspiration oppressors for justification rationalization and legitimacy nothing illustrates this more clearly than the history of writing on the american negro people now while one cannot quibble with the profundity of this observation he cannot accept the assumption implied here that history is never based on fact that both the oppressor and the oppressed can interpret a single event differently and both be right no cannot agree only one is right and that is the oppressed people granted history has always been on the side of the oppressor but this is because it was the oppressor who wrote it the world however is becoming wiser every day we see now that history can only be on the side of the oppressed since it is the oppressed who are seeking liberation and as we say history should liberate liberation this is true history false history or propaganda to give it its right name in the name of the oppressor attempts to oppress it strives for justification rationalization and legitimacy in order to continue oppressing to understand the past and hence the present it is essential to distinguish between these two histories for one is the history of the oppressed the other the history of the oppressor and we must close the door on the latters history and swiftly we badly need this distinction in order to read properly such statements as the one from maurice merleauponty that heads lerone bennett jrs essay collected in this volume history takes still more from those who have lost everything and gives yet more to those who have taken everything for its sweeping judgments acquit the unjust and dismiss the pleas of their victims history never confesses now merleauponty obviously means by history false history or propaganda or white history because we know our history has and does confess the injustice of the white man this very book under review right now attests to this fact in his essay mr bennett goes on to accuse styron of playing the new history game of reviving big black sambo in other words he is trying to prove that u b phillips and stanley elkins were right when they projected samboto bootlicking headscratching childman as a dominant plantation type page and when styrons nat is not a sambo he is according to mr bennett a neurasthenic hamletlike white intellectual in blackface this is very accurate because when one thinks about it almost all the liberals one knows believe more in sambos and hamlets a type i never did dig than they do in for example their own wives indeed mr bennett has a good many things to say for example he shows how styron manages to change the facts of nats family life to create a proper adc slave family page his most valuable idea however is this in his determination to reduce liberty to personal passions and history to some of dat white stuff styron ignores this evidence the facts of nats actual confession and questions nat turners credentials as a leader page mr bennett refutes beautifully styrons silly notion that nats having killed only one person had something to do with his psychological motivation mr bennett shows convincingly that nat operated as a field general and as such did not have the time to spend killing alvin f poussiant md in his essay points out the psychological implication of styrons natwhat such a creation must say about styron himself i do not think however this essay goes as deeply as it could have gone in pointing out the similarities between styron and his creation i mean if styrons nat is sexually abnormal as mr pouissant says surely this must say something about styrons own sexual fantasy lifeie from a professional point of view vincent harding gets very close to home when he states that although nat is a preacher there is only one attempt by styron to make this known to the reader ie the book contains only one sermon when in real life nat must have made thousands and again mr harding is correct in observing that the book fails to catch any of the peculiar rhythmic and thematic strengths of this ie the sermon folk art form equally striking is the fact that the religious music of afroamericans never enters as a major structural element of the novel as one would expect if such a work had been done by an ellison a baldwin or a wright page john o killens contribution is valuable not so much for what it says as how it says it in this essay the thin slashes of the ironists whip is laid across every inch of styrons bare back one regrets that more of the contributors did not take a more detached oblique attack on the subject matter for as would be expected there was an occasional overlap of ideas mr killens believes that styrons first mistake was to attempt the novel the second mistake was to pretend to tell the story from the point of view of turner and it was a colossal error one that required tremendous arrogance and naivete page and so mr killens goes quickly to the core of assumptions surrounding the novel here are two irreconciliable moralities the slavemasters to maintain slavery blatant or benevolent at any cost the slaves to utterly destroy the slavery system by every and any means the masters ethics are always enslavement the slaves are ever liberation the liberator is the moral man page this is the most important idea in the book there is also in this essay a long enough quote from mr arna bontemps black thunder to show that the novel is superior to styrons why didnt mr bontemps i wonder get a pulitzer prize also in terms of the language in styrons book john a williams has a lot of insight so does mike thelwell who in his essay speaks of black language as being a language of action rather than one of reflection page and i think these two contributors are right in saying that styrons basic misunderstanding of negro language resulted in some disastrous effects in his novel the most informative essay ie apart from the historical facts which almost all the contributors shared is the one by ernest kaiser mr kaiser gives a brief bibliography of novels and plays dealing with slave uprisings then he reviews the reviews of styrons novel as would be expected white conservatives white radicals and liberals all agreed that the book was as harpers said a masterpiece loyle hairston and charles v hamiltons essays are both solidly based mr hairston accuses styron of failing to create a real nat turner because styron was a victim of moral cowardice which prevented him from seeing nat as a man as a mature member of the human family mr hamilton sees styrons book as part of what he calls white liberal rhetoric that has been going on in the writing of american history text books used in our high schools and colleges we black people should give special thanks to the people of beacon press for making possible this critical reply to such an injust book as styrons as i understand it this is a first of a series of black things that beacon press is getting together carry on cecil m brown should we follow the s configurations of time and eternity if we were black man or jew we might reach a dark harbor even as we search for a haven if we were to follow the myths of the chosen people or those of the wretched of the earth this would lead us into the beginnings of history and the configurations which we would meet on this journey so various and changing would seem dark mirages thus in our comparison of two movements zionism and negritude we cannot in this brief comparison chase all the configurations of time or explore the symbols of a statement such as i am black and comely ah ye daughters of jerusalem we will but show how two forms cast their flickering shadows partir comme il y a des hommeshyenes et des hommes pantheres je serais un homme juif un hommehindoudecalcutta un hommedeharlemquinevotepas lhomme famine vhommeinsulte lhommetorture on pouvait in these lines from the cahier dun retour au pays natal the great poet of negritude aime cesaire totally identifies with the jew depicting a brutal situation which both the black man and the jew have suffered since man is his situation he derives a power from that situation making it vital and and dynamic for instance eugene oneill is the voice of the twentieth century claims professor hartman in a recent lecture because in many ways he is the victim of the twentieth century thus out of that situation in which the black man and the jew are victims two revitalizing forces have emergedthe singing voices of zionism and negritude which have given a new intonation a new rhythm to their own historical chaos chaos prepared me and i find the track through life and darkness seek my myth move toward it hunting grow more like draw near and know it through our path know only that we run one path muriel rukeyser that one path leads from exile to return from the diaspora to the geular from alienation to reconciliation from absence from the the path will lead back to the homeland back to the earth even as it had led them astray before but the time of a symbolic return is perhaps only known by the passing wind the days have passed we are a wandering camp brighter days before us perhaps god is angry the elders have gone their bones are far their souls wander where are their souls t i v the passing wind the spirit that whirls the leaf knows it perhaps pygmy poem that dark night which this traditional pygmy poem evokes the anguish of the ancestors and the dispersion of their bones are all circumstances which give rise to those motifs of suffering abandonment and death which abound in some of the poetry of the zionist poets such as hayyim nahman bialik and tchernichovski and in that of many negritude poets aime cesaire leon damas and leopold sedar senghor my memory is surrounded by blood my memory has its belt of corpses aime cesaire and in bialiks long poem the city of slaughter there is an unrelieved darkness and destruction blood spatters the walls and corpses abound behold on tree on stone on fence on mural clay the spattered blood and dried brains of the dead bialik and in the hell hole of the poem the dead seek a reason for their purgatory tumbling and stumbling wraiths they come and cower there their silence whimpers and it is their eyes which cry wherefore o lord and why bialik in this poem there is only despair dread and hopelessness but in his longer poem the dead of the wilderness so similar in many respects to cesaires cahier dun retour au pays natal bialik resurrects the dead of heroic stature here who through an apocalyptic action momentarily free themselves from a long sleep the setting for the poem is the silence and rocky desolation of a desert where symbolically the hatred of the serpent for these dead is expressed hatred instinctive and ancient runs through the shuddering body and the wilderness midnight and monsters which crept out from the dawn of creation represents the lived geography of those who lie o deep in the earth their heads sunk heavy with tangles neglected the poet imbues these dead with life and makes them rise up in revolt a song of strength and revolt has reached us and we rise behold us we will ascend with the tempest though the lord has withdrawn his hand from us bailik after this revolt there is a purer silence in aime cesaires cahier dun retour au pays natal it is the poet who gives purpose to the desolation of the island home to which he is returning who accepts the dead landscape of his country its peoples dismal hopes who by accepting their wounds cleanses them jai longtemps erre et je revie ns vers la hideur desertee de vos plaies je viendrais a ce pays mien et je lui dirais embrassezmoi sans crainte and as damas puts it nous avons besoin de toucher du doigt toutes les plaies qui zebrent le livree noire through the union of the poet with the land he exalts the anguish of the people in these two long poems cahier dun retour au pays natal and the dead of the wilderness whose landscapes are elemental in their starkness and timeless in their barreness pervaded by horizontal images of despair and death the poets by the word make of anguish and suffering a unique quality in much of the poetry of zionism and negritude there runs then a sense of uniqueness wherein the sufferings of these peoples clothe them with distinctiveness and so in the bialik poem surely the people is grass the people receive pity as great as the sea compassion as wide as his peoples weakness strong as the weight of the burden leon damas gives a converse dynamism to endurance patience charm etc and makes of these the life force an enduring quality of the black man thus by poetic conversion he can proclaim never will the white become negro for beauty is negro but this uniqueness stems from a reaction becomes positive through a counter movement when a d gordon asks this question about uniqueness it is a rhetorical one which postulates a positive and indeed many writers of zionism and of negritude inject the people with a positive quality a uniqueness which by its very nature differentiates them from others while distinguishing them it relates them to the total history of humanity the uniqueness which is often claimed in zionism lies in the metaphysical relationship between god man and the land and that of negritude in the ontological relationship between the vital forces man and earth in both instances the earth takes on special qualities in zionism with such biblical promises as say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken isaiah chap v in negritude give that postulate of the vital forces which states that anything which diminishes the vital forces is bad anything which adds to it is good the exile of peoples of african descent from the homeland is a diminishing of the total force of the land of africa and by extension of the african thus the relationship of both jews and people of african descent to a homeland takes on a special significance and return to that homeland a symbolic quality the goals of many zionist thinkers though varying in degree all relate to the question of return to the land by the same token those of many thinkers who proclaim negritude relate to an ingathering on peoples existentially destroys the special concepts of the remoteness or proximity of these people to that point of land where the vital essence exists thus the ingathering the return becomes a philosophical possibility indeed at times a political necessity albert einstein puts it thus palestine will become a cultural home for all jews a refuge for the worst sulferers from oppression a field of activity for the best among us a unifying ideal and a source of spiritual help for the jews of every country it assures the national survival of jews and the jewish culture palestine is first and foremost the incarnation of a reawakening sense of national solidarity it is for me beyond any shadow of doubt that in present circumstances the rebuilding of palestine is the only object which has sufficiently strong appeal to stimulate the jews to effective corporate action albert einstein about zionism speeches and letters einsteins statement can be taken as one possible definition of zionism in it he stresses the cultural collective possibilities deriving from an ingathering of the jewish people it is this cultural collective which lies at the base of many definitions of negritude leopold sedar senghor defines it thus negritude is the whole complex of civilized valuescultural economic social and political which characterise the black peoples or more precisely the negroafrican world all these values are essentially informed by intuitive reason because this sentient reason the reason which comes to grips expresses itself emotionally through that selfsurrender that coalescence of subject and object through mythsby which i mean the archetypal images of the collective soulabove all through primordial rhythms these primordial rhythms express the total link of man with time for the dead the ancestors are a vital continuum between the present and the past the child is an ancestor and the ancestor a child mon enfance mes agneaux est vieille comme le monde et je suis jeune comme vaurore eternellement jeune du monde in zionism as well as in negritude whether the writers are gripped by anguish or released by revolt whether they search for uniqueness of race or a freedom from selfexile they all become visionaries who perceive the possibility of a new era in the world senghor who ahad haam who hoped to make of the reconstruction of zion a bridge between east and west giving a positive force to the world also used the image leaven in the dough to denote the necessity of adding a lift to the zionist movement the poetprophets of zionism and negritude who attempted to give the jew and the black man a sense of awareness of self of dignity and pride who attempted to inject the sum total of cultural values in relationship to a heritage when that heritage and potential seemed to have been excluded from the mainstream of world culture can all say like cesaire that ultimately their work is big tobacco brown stonewall jackson fourquet was a sailor who had found the last portthe inland pantown of new franklin february homecoming man alone all of his family even obscure cousins had found their port too the sweet potatocolored clay of crown hill cemetery a half mile beyond the towns integrated junction of stonewall jackson fourquet weighed pounds and was almost six feet tall all the old people remembered him and the violin which had belonged to his father who had played at the cakewalk dances attended by sonnys grand parents the original violin had been lost many years ago had been replaced time and again the old sailor said the sea is my wife and the violin my first born he arrived in new franklin with a brand new violin that he had bought in hamburg germany and played it that friday night at the hughes chapel methodist church social played in the beginning foreign music or so it seemed we had heard such music occasionally at the movies and on the radio and when enlightened blacks and whites from howard county and the surrounding counties descended on us with a paper bag of classical music displaying a warm toothy smile hed say i played this in paris and the white folk didnt know what to think of me playing that kind of music or a chinaman in marseilles or you aint heard nothing until you have heard a gypsy play a violin im gonna do my best to be a gypsy tonight for you and we sat hushed hypnotized in our pews and were transported to the gypsy caves of spain to barcelona you knew from the tone of the violin that the gypsies in spain were not like the mongrel pickedchicken looking gypsies that visited our town coffee hot chocolate gingerbread and deepdish apple pie was served during the intermission but everyone just wanted to crowd around and say hello and shake the hand of the local boy who had traveled the seven seas afterwards stonewall jackson fourquet switched into god bless america and ended with a pure breathtaking swing low sweet chariot a foottapping handclapping when the saints go marching in hughes chapel was on fire that cold friday night already people were calling him jackson or saying hey stonewall as if they had known him all their lives a rollicking legend he shared his real foreign world with our foreign world of dreams and went to board in the widow wilma clarks house and sleep in her spare back room which overlooked her prized cherry trees soon he was playing all over the county and for white folks too winters were long lonely and cold the only warmth was from our houses open fires and from within ourselves church once a week but sometimes it snowed so hard there wasnt any church services it was work to bundle up and go uptown to the movies on sunday afternoons the roxy was often closed because of weather and poor attendance from saturday nights showing some of us had manual phonographs and your best bet was a batteryoperated radio in case the power lines blew down or were frozen that late winter was better than most because we had stonewall jackson fourquet we talked about him constantly and saw what he had seen in our minds spring came early that year and you could hear him playing under the big shade tree beside the tracks near the railroad roundhouse and in the sweet evenings when he wasnt playing for white people on mrs wilma clarks pillared side porch he often reminisced he had a locker trunk of mementoes and photographs carefully pasted into handtooled leatherbound scrapbooks he had arrived during the cold weather which made the tattoos turn ashen like the skin of an old alligator sitting in the sun but now it was spring and his great brown arms glowed through hairy sweat an iridescent frieze roses mermaids skull and bones ships girls names and crude berber blue xs on his lollipop ears reciting foreign tales in a deep slow preachers voice or like a dying wind storm sitting on a wooden soda pop case down by the viaduct or in front of the red dog cafe someone would say hey jackson play us a little tune and hed reply what would you boys like to hear while waiting for us to make up our minds hed drift into something like darktown strutters ball the violin secure under the double layer of chin fat like a stiff board in a ton of soft concrete closing his eyes on you are my sunshine and the early morning air seemed filled with daisies daisies sprouting in moist green fields and we knew what we had suspected all along stonewall jackson fourquet was courting mrs wilma clark who was seven years his senior we were very happy for the woman who had lost her lower dental plate and lived in a dark antiquecluttered house and baked the best cakes in town that missouri summer was a county fair the yearly flood never reached its peak there was only one death sonnys girl friends oldest sister died mysteriously in weston sam lawson the town drunk found a permanent job sonnys cousin graduated from high school in boonville and received a scholarship to jefferson citys lincoln university and sonny had discovered hemingway and a new world swallowed him whole it took him a long time to recover from hemingway he did not understand mary ellas volume of freud and if he did not understand the gypsies he was at least fascinated by them foreign colorful wanderers a caravan of them arrived late in july and camped in the vacant lot fronting the new handsome white high school this lot was also headquarters for the toby ward tent shows the midwests broadway and summer stock sonny visited the gypsy caravan each morning the gypsies slept late except for a gypsy boy and girl who met him beside the school children crossing sign where they shared dr pepper soda pop and ate green apples stared and grinned at each other in a shy warm fashion the gypsy children were not interested in baseball and always did number one and two in broad daylight they seemed to eat nothing but corn one day stonewall jackson fourquet said to sonny gypsies all over the world boy once i was in algeciras spain it was a hot august night and i was a little blue black and blue i didnt even feel like playing my violin i didnt want no spanish poontang i jest started and walked out of the crowded harbor walked until i saw some gypsies camping on a little bay just outside of town behind pine trees it was hot and i was sweating like a nigger on election day the gypsies were frying fish and there was light from the campfires and moon like croquet wickets a strange light that wasnt like no day or night light pretty soon the gypsies started singing and clapping their hands they played guitars too and i wished had brought along my violin i was so lonely i jest stood a little ways off and watched them and id never felt lonely nowhere in the world i looked up at that sky getting a little black like dark was setting in though it must have been around midnight the moon was trapped like a rabbit behind clouds i knew i had to go home i was born here and i was tired of traveling i jest wanted to rest with my violin sonny and the old sailor were standing up by smittys gas station where the local fayette and boonville buses stopped heres a dime boy git you some soda pop or something thanks mr fourquet sonny said starting off he had learned when the old sailor wanted to be alone that very night mrs wilma clark had a stroke and died before morning and soon it was september and we knew winter was just around the bend and we began rationing our laughter or so it seemed sonnys grandpa was very happy that september his daughter laura jane scudder arrived with her naval bridegroom sonnys grandpa had worked for her parents as housemangardener had babysat with laura jane just as soon as laura jane had unpacked and introduced her husband to her father she brought him over to meet uncle charlie and aunt dora grandma served iced tea in the company glasses and stonewall dropped by and played sweet and sassy until dusk the naval officer kept his eyes on stonewall they talked of hong kong bombay port said of ships and the sea and soon afterwards they were meeting every day in the negro beer garden behind oconnors bar and restaurant where they drank corn liquor until it was time for the young groom to stagger to his fatherinlaws house on east main street and fall into his fairhaired brides arms mr scudder told sonnys grandpa hell he hasnt finished sowing his wild oats him and jackson are both navy men hell laura jane was worried crazy she stopped sonny in front of the post office one afternoon jumped out of her new ford car and grabbed sonny by the arm sonny boy i want you to tell uncle charlie that hes got to do something about stonewall and my husband keith hasnt had a drop since hong kong and look at him now what will people think grandpa upon receiving the message sighed so hard his mustache looked as if it might take off like a long winged bird ill talk to him grandpa said the following morning a saturday stonewall jackson fourquet walked slowly through the gate of their house morning dora he said im leaving i jest came by to say goodbye to sonny sonny was in the kitchen devouring his favorite breakfast scrambled eggs and potato cakes he had heard stonewalls dying wind storm voice and had silently said no and looked down at his plate sonny grandma called brightly someone wants to see you and guess what they have for you im coming the boy said running out of the house and feigning a smile ill see you boys later grandma said i have to bake bread sonny and the sailor sat down on the front porch stoop and stared out at the morning monochromatic street scene the sky was colorless the air humid white frame houses sand colored dust and gravel and like a giant proclamation the motionless leaves on the trees i saw your grandpa and i aint leaving cause of what miss laura jane said youre leaving for good yes stonewall jackson fourquet said he gave sonny a long razor with a carved ivory handle thank you sonny said accepting the gift for seaborne dreams thats all right the old sailor said i came back home i cant say i have been unhappy here it was jest as good as growing up in new franklin but talking to that young man made things stir in me again all the love and money in the world couldnt make me stay in this town the sea is my friend and what man would desert his best friend a white man creates a sexless black man and then invites the cats momma and daddy to dinner and we who have some kind of wild unique copyright on signification are expected not to recognize same it would appear that the white imagination scene of the assumption overload would cast upon us an unbelievable nigger in yet another attempt at denying the nigger they hold sacred which of course implies that theyre not so out of it as reflected by their endless rituals of the mind and those lame reports that flow therefrom the wouldbe work of art in question is the years smash sidney poitier spectacular that will leave you not merely trying to guess who came to dinner but indeed drive you to a whole new level of confusion if you seek to understand exactly what came to dinner the black hero dressed too sharply to be a renegade arrives in the west coast city by the gate drooling from eyebrow to belt buckleand no further brotherover dagwoods daughter who in short days convinced him that all the pains of loneliness encountered since being widowed would vanish like dandruff blending with supermarket blond hair she is bringing him home to meet mommy and pappy who of course belong to that select group of white citizens who did not instruct her in the ofay science of racism but as though to prove that modern white folk are slicker than them bygone crackers they give sugar and spice the urge to act human and save the blindfoldthe one that leaves man thinking his relation to animal is a mythfor puppy dog tails you dig it wasnt because i didnt want to says little miss muffett to a shocked mommy who in the world we know wouldve taken everybody through new chances with her tales about w wanting to get in a groove with sambo but the moviemakers their insidiousness approaching distant heights would take that ancient value that has so rigidified and immobilized white america and contaminate we who have never thought lovemaking a crime you instinctively know that the fan is not safe from the bowels but they dont even bother to bring the crap on subtly old dad turns out to be no more than another awkward elmer fudd who never once conceived of the abstractions in his lifelong philosophy coming to life and his response to this event that left him and his money helpless is that all that superficial leverage which had been his manhood came to a rapid demise he peels before our eyes and with out our sympathy down to his core near his dried up old seed symbolized of course by his dropping his coffee up tight the hollywood way but he could just as easily have gone running for the exlax but one cannot be certain that the old dudes disassembling was entirely the result of the impending nuptials for we too would endure some kind of wild shock if we were whitey come face to face with this fellow of cottonfield heritage strutting into our oalace with credentials enough to embarrass einstein who was they say one of the great white thinkers notwithstanding the fact that he failed to save jack and jill from their perversion so much for the plot the circus ensues featuring the same old drumbeat that has taught the world how much mr and mrs america are out of tune but of course claims contemporary relevance because the boy with the briefcase pretending to be a man once was a cat who knew an honorable way of getting out of his bvds true to its reputation as a world of few real climaxes white america using her socalled artists as much as her copsimposes another unreal climax upon us cloaked in garments of weakness designed to attract our tears but guaranteed to remind us that its all a farce covering up the same human body and its condition to the scene come superniggers parents all aflame over his decision to wed little red riding hood pun but sweet mother black soon succumbs to the depth of understanding emerging from mother hood which leaves out of harmony with the universe only papa hood god himself and naturally the big black wolf whose laddie went astray bring on the dramatics baby some mystical voice must have hollered because mr world leader suddenly inhales a streak of cool honesty and digs his faulknerian legacy for what it is cops a pleait was nothing moreand proceeds to give as though it contained some pertinence his blessings to the brave and daring couple of course he did not mention that the first step towards their happy dointhethang days would best be to behead him with precision not unlike that with which he had long ago deballed himself but the black conquerors old man must have been hip to that because even as they faded away from the screen finally he appeared to be doing something less than sanctioning what had just gone down perhaps even whitey is unable to tell a whole lie having not extracted all the humanity from either the black father or the soul sister maid who on occasion delivers real lines that evoke real laughter but he sure as hell tried and one is actually left pitying him because he used the same old broad to turn the same old trickdavid llorens following is the way james h malone describes his approach to art and the people i like

ghetto mother making handmedowns and i walk around the corner and run into a pretty ghetto girl my people this ghetto area just exists it is something different to paint im not a crusader and trying to say something about poverty its just an accident that im painting it im surrounded by the things i portray mr malone is talking about detroit where he lives and works he lives on the midwest side near one of the communities which went up in smoke during the rebellion of he works as a commercial artist doing newspaper advertisements for a large retail department store a native of georgia mr malone attended morehouse college later studied under scholarship at the famous artists art school and at the society of arts and crafts in detroit his works have won awards at atlanta university in the us army and he has the distinction of being the first black georgian to receive the george h clapp art award his artistic focus on the black community has gained him salutes by local radio and television stations mr malone also creates cartoons some have appeared in negro digest and greeting card illustrations he plans to offer a series of cartoons for syndication i feel that i am immortalizing americana he says americana of my time making the contemporary live though i have much respect for abstract art and appreciate it it does not give enough record of our clothing styles architecture habits and moods i am white not povertystricken freer than most because of a certain nimbleness of utterance too old now to feel or regret the loss of all the promises of the american dream but i am sick at heart of the paralysis that will not let me be my brothers keeper of the years and the agonies that let me know fully as much as the black people that my life in this country and its ideology have been a lie that the whole testament of libertarian ideas and promises i was told to live by and defend with my life has been a pious fraud i look upon our gross corruption of the rights of man the ground rules that are supposed to order my daily existence here and know that to accept this corruption is committing a sin against my own senses against the light that is in me if i accept without daily rising anger these present past and future disparities in the human condition i realize i am committing the greatest of sins that of hypocrisy which blinds a man to his own failings and gives him a false idea of his position and purpose in the world those words written from the soul of a man in a chapter called the souls of white folks reveal the rare honesty of a white american who could write a book the right of revolution beacon press in which hetruman nelson supports the black mans right indeed his human obligation to free himself from the tyranny of whites by as malcolm said any means necessary truman nelsonslike stringfellows and mertons and lennie brucesis a voice too few of his white countrymen have actually heard which is of course related to the institutionalized racism brother carmichael speaks of for let there be no mistake if the liberals whove been running the show hadnt so cleverly stored such voices in the attic of idealism and entertainment the my fellow americans mentality would not be the intelligence level to which most of this republics citizens aspire any black man who has faced a white audience in this country and their nauseating questions has wanted desperately to shove such books as this down their throatsliterallyuntil they choke up all those tv commercials without which they would have no testament to their being for truman nelson historian and novelist did not start writing yesterday and one cannot sympathize with white people who rather than face their ignorance persist in defending and glorifying an educational process in which one who would have had them know something real about their history and their real heroes john brown robert david thoreau theodore parker wendell phillips had no place but this book as well should be digested by those blacks who are occupying the places and the rejected personalities of liberated whites as fast as they fleebecause there is not alive in this land today any man more deluded than a black man who has convinced himself that he doesnt understand why the brother is raising so much hell functional blacks are asking some pretty inane questions these days giving truth to nelsons observation that there has never been an instance in the history of the world where an oppressed people have been educated for freedom by their taskmasters my italics that sentence and this book should be read as many times as is required to comprehend their importance david llorens
ruchard wrights t revealing statement concerning the literam ture that he wrote had little to do with literature at all in his autobiography black boy wright recorded there are some elusive profound recondite things that men find hard to say to other men but with the negro it is the little things of life that become hard to say for these tiny items shape his destiny a man will seek to express his relations to the stars but when a mans consciousness has been riveted upon obtaining a loaf of bread that loaf of bread is as important as the stars metaphorically speaking the choice was one between the abstract and the pragmatic between a literature which did not in the words of critic stanley braithwaite hover over the race question but instead owed its highest allegiance to poetry and a realistic art which dealt with the fundamental problem of being negro in americaart which refused to either ignore or subsume the problem through adherence to critical standards acceptable to the american academic community having made his choice richard wright refused to compromise believing always that words were weapons he dared to probe levels of experience which more timid writers bypassed like goethes faust he was obsessed by an insatiable desire to delve into the pits of darkness and despair in an attempt to reveal the inferno of human discontent fear hatred and violence which is the most telling characteristic of twentieth century man having himself undergone experiences which can only be called kafkaesque in their grotesqueness like coleridges ancient mariner he was ravished with a passion to tell his story to inform the naive of the malady of terror with which everyman trapped in a brutal oppressive environment is inflicted for this reason his earliest fiction was naturalistic and there was certainly a great deal of truth in his admonition that all my life had shaped me for the realism the naturalism of the modern novel yet neither his writings nor his experiences can be so narrowly categorized the negro writes saunders redding lives on two planes of awareness which is close to saying that the negros experiences are likely to be at one and the same time both realistic and existential to be sure the negro lives in a society in which his outlook upon life his personality and his psychological makeup are predetermined to a great degree howeve r each negro despite the disclaimers envisions a coming gotierdamerung when like the existential hero he undertakes the establishment of his own identity by destroving in total the oppressive restrictive societal apparatus which he secretly loathes it is not true therefore as ralph ellison among others has intimated that wright was stifled and restricted by the form of the naturalistic novel for in the lieht of whis myriad experiences wright could not completely adhere to the naturalistic formula despite his indebtedness to emile zola the father of the naturalistic novel or to theodore dreiser whose sister carrie had a tremendous effect upon him unlike his counterparts for wright there was always the insurmountable barrier of color which constituted a wedge of such fortitude between reality and illusion as to produce a fiction vastly different from that of other naturalistic adherents but insofar as a black writer could be true to any formula wright was true to the naturalistic code yet he never forgot his earlier injunction that a loaf of bread is as important as the stars his literature therefore would always contain a schizophrenic quality wavering as did the lives of those whom he wrote about between pragmatism and transcendence he never lost sight of the pull of those tremendous forces upon the individual yet he took cognizance of the individuals obsession to crush those forces he never ceased to marvel at how smoothly the black boys acted out the roles that the race had mapped out for them most of them were not conscious of living a special separate stunted way of life yet in some period of their growinga period they had no doubt forgottenthere had been developed in them a delicate sensitive controlling mechanism that shut off their minds and emotions from all that the white race said was taboo yet he knew and perhaps he was his own best example that the personality had not been totally destroyed that all emotions had not been channeled into a predetermined direction that the social institutions had not completely transformed million people into nonthinking nonsensitive nonfeeling robots and never mind that men wore masks never mind that men refused to articulate the truth never mind that men practiced the art of mimeticsand american negroes have made a profession of the artthe atmosphere of hatred and fear which created bigger thomas is still present in modern day america goading and pushing each negro across the nihilistic brink where in one transcendent moment he is lifted above his predetermined state gaining a sense of manhood identity and social worth through the only means possible in an oppressive societythe medium of violence this is the reality of bigger thomas ignored by white and black critics alike there can however be no doubt of biggers transcendence in book one of native son bigger thomas is indeed the mechanical robot the prototype of the naturalistic character he had the feeling that the robbing of blums would be a violation of ultimate taboo it would be a trespassing into territory where the full wrath of an alien white world would be turned loose upon him it would be a symbolic challenge of the white worlds rule over him a challenge which he yearned to make but was afraid the bigger thomas of book two however transcends this fear this section is appropriately labelled flightfor it signifies not only biggers flight from the law but also his flight from the frightened unsure boy of book one to whom white folks formed a kind of superworld the thought of what he had done wright elaborates after bigger murders mary dalton the awful horror of it the daring associated with such actions formed for him for the first time in his fearridden life a barrier of protection between him and a world he feared he had murdered and created a new life for himself americans wright was to record much laterreferring to native sonhave not been able to accept my vision which is not completely trueamericans were capable of accepting the vision in part critics admit to the sanctity of the sociological argument agree that the institutions of the american society have been repressive in regard to its black minority indeed few would disagree with the indictment of the american social svstem leveled by biggers lawyer max that part of the vision which americans have not been able to acceptdespite the recent yearly insurrections in the ghettosis a nation of bigger thomases for whom no hope can be found for whom no peace can come for whom no transcendence is possible save through the flaming armageddon of violent revolution but on another level as james baldwin has pointed out americans have little to fear from bigger thomas the underlying thesis of native son offers hope to the american society if that society will come to the unmistakable conclusion that men live despicable lives of continuous desperation and undertake those programs which by resurrecting bigger thomas will grant salvation to the nation as a whole it is on this level baldwins critique to the contrary that bigger thomas serves as the christ figure the martyr to the hopes of desperate men everywhere the catalytic agent by which a society can be redeemed but hope writes matthew arnold once crushed is less quick to spring anew and the bigger thomas of the s is the embryo of the bigger thomas of the s and s this is not to maintain as wright has been accused of doing that blacks have not made progress in the american society since the s but rather to suggest that progress must be measured not in terms of civil_rights material wealth or governmental appointments but instead in terms of level of consciousness and the awareness by black people of those tremendous forces of which bigger could only conjecturea realization that the human spirit must be free unrestricted by either demagogic men or demagogic institutions wright was among the first to recognize such progress and to create a character who serves as a footnote to black men today those for whom all hope has been dissipated all optimism subsumed under the weight of constant rejection men who see salvation not in terms of resurrecting the society but in dismantling it in toto to produce a social order in which each individual will be the architect of his own destiny the outsider written years after native son is the archetype of the new spiritthe first black character in american fiction to dare all in an existential attempt to stave off personal dehumanization in damon the bridge from bigger thomas to nihilistic man is traversed for by the nature of things such a man sooner or later was bound to appear modem man sleeps in the myths of the greeks and jews those myths are now dying in his head and in his heart they can no longer serve him when they are really gone those myths man returns and whats to guide him nothing at all but his own desires which would be his only values such a vision was totally rejected by americans both black and white a nation of men clutching a dream which has long since become a nightmare for most of its citizens a nation whose people are daily tranquilized by the rhetoric of its leaders portraying a land of freedom promise and opportunity while one tenth of its population knows only misery despair and frustrationis it any wonder that such a nation would be incapable of accepting the existence of a character for whom the society is so degenerate as to produce a savage obsession to destroy everything that society has constructed even wright himself was ambivalent towards this vision he could not accept cross damon as readily as he accepted bigger thomas for it is damon not bigger who is the real monster that aberration as one unkind critic has remarked upon humankind bigger blunders into murder cross skillfully executes it biggers motives are guided by urges beyond his control damons are premeditated each step well calculated bigger desired to create a new identity cross desired no less than to create a new world bigger wants to share in the protestant ethic cross will settle only for an ethic devised by himself bigger is the disgruntled reformer cross is closer to being a nihilist in the camus sense than any character in american fiction a nihilist is not one who believes in nothing writes albert camus he simply does not believe in what exists at the moment and wrights creation but not wright himself could adhere to this philosophy wright believed wholeheartedly in the ethics and values which damon theoretically at leastwanted to destroy and thus wrights most complex character got out of hand refusing to allow his master to resurrect him even at the end of the novel damon remains the prophetic portrait of modernday black men who are putting forth the most nihilistic of questionswhether a nation which continues to physically and mentally murder and maim onetenth of its people has any valid reason for existing wright himself had asked a similar question before in the short story bright and morning star aunt sue is forced to choose between saving her life and that of her son or protecting the movement which is to eventually usher in the new jerusalem over the dying corpse of the old her hatred of the old system is so intense that she chooses in favor of the movement despite the tenuous position upon which the movement rests wright never made such a choice despite periods of overwhelming doubt he remained wedded to the theoretical concepts of western democracy despite his brief excursion into the communist party despite his selfimposed exile he remained convincedas he argued in black_powerthat the survival of western civilization rested upon the coexistence and corecognition of multicultures in which the sanctity of all would be inviolate his vision though often varied remained true to the theme of his earlier writings he saw the possibility of transcendence in the bigger thomases of the nation and he warned america that a nation incapable of putting its ideals into practice would produce cross damons seeking their manhood through a nihilistic attempt to negate the very structure of democracy itself he reaffirmed this thesis in white man listen projecting his vision onto the world arena here he admonished the world powers east and west that at present the wretched of the earth could transcend their conditions only through violence and if this remained the price that men would have to pay for individual freedom then pay it they would this was wrights final message to white men and in light of the turbulence of the past years the message is perhaps already outdated for wright is the last black writer to admonish men to listen today the representatives of that third force which frantz fanon envisioned as moving beyond existentialism to create a world order out of many varied identities no longer seek to communicate with those who continue the oppression begun by their ancestors each day the lines of communication between black man and white man in particular and man and man in general drift wider apart and perhaps the telling mark of the twentieth century is the inability of one man to communicate with another this wright would not have liked he believed always in the community of man and he realized that complete dedication to nihilism would make impossible the building of such a community true then to his basic idealsto those ethics and values hewn out of the violence and terror of those most darkest of southern nights he would still believe even at the time of his death with andre malraux that every man is a mad man but what is a human destiny for if not to unite the mad man with the universe richard wright and i were sitting in a bedroom of the zephyr on the way to nashville tennessee we had for us luxurious accommor dations and we were both enjoying the comfort of the double compartment we had taken off our jackets donned slippers and called the porter for ice and soda to mix drinks it was april in and we had just left chicago on the way to fisk university where dick was to speak to the students and faculty and i was to address the sociology department charles s johnson head of the sociology department had invited us and we traveled in style for the university was paying our expenses dick had been staying with me in chicago for a week filled with parties dinners and meeting people from the university of chicago and members of the institute for psychoanalysis we were both tired and the privacy and comfort of our accommodations suited our mood we sat facing each other before the broad picture window in this deluxe surrounding our drinks on a small table between us the train speeding along wheels clacking a rhythm under us the scenery swirling past in a blur the hoarse mooo of the zephyrs horn swept back over us like drawnout notes of a trombone caught up the clang of bells to warn of a railroad crossing standing in the dust just off the rightofway was an old bentover black man leaning on his cane this zephyr went so fast it swirled papers and stuff into a small tornado whipped his overcoat over his bony frame and rocked him about as we hurtled on down the tracks dick said that old man tell you what hes thinking these white people millions and millions go by and blow smoke and dust in this old mans face and i can hardly get home to cook my grits and beans and side pork they go on and on and i wonder where my family has gone up north someplace but not on that train he could enter the mind of this old man identify with affection and joy but as an artist he could not make such identification or empathize with a white person we were silent awhile the incident enhanced our mood were over the border now dick said were over the old masondixon line in these days crossing the line was a matter of consequence for here formal jim crow came into force nashville isnt too bad for the south i said fisk is an oasis once were on the campus well its okay dinner chimes sounded in the corridor lets eat in the room i suggested i dont feel like putting on shoes and a tie and i dont feel like looking into the faces of a lot of redfaced peckerwoods dick said a solicitous waiter served us excellent steaks and we went to bed earlv the next morning we got up rested both in a good mood i was in the small bathroom shaving what time do we get into nashville dick asked about eleventhirty how about breakfast i can ring for the waiter i thought what the hell weve got a hard day ahead of us but i knew dick would goad me into going to the diner i knew he would persist driven to a new experience in jim crow living which he knew would humiliate and infuriate him how do they segregate you down here i really dont know on this particular train they pull a curtain or something i honestly dont know for sure lets go try it i slammed the razor stuff into the small cabinet and stepped into the compartment look weve got this bedroom lets call a waiter god i dont need to go through everything to know how it feels but he goaded me because he had driven himself to experience this thing i didnt want to weasel out to be a coward and besides i was curious too i took my jacket from the hanger okay lets go we had to walk through three cars down narrow passageways bumping into other passengers the train rocking over its uneven roadbed we came to the diner at the kitchen and pantry end and stood waiting in line to be seated the white steward moved from one end of the car to the other seating people as they came in he glanced at us two two i said other people crowded behind us the steward looked over our shoulders and said three onefour he seated these people right away then others and in the meantime i knew we were going to be seated in one or the other of the end tables nearest the pantry the pantry where the waiters set up their trays call thjr orders fill their water pitchers and coffee pots didnt i know how many times had i as a waiter crowded into that hot little space these tables are the most undesirable in in the dining car the jim crow section i recognized as the four and the deuce tables nearest the pantry they were occupied by whites we waited the people at the four soon finished our waiter rushed up to stack the dishes he was short stout darkbrown sweat was popping out in beads on his lined face i poked dick and said were getting special attention you know that i laughed but inside me i spilled obscenities in every language i knew against these whites i heard my voice crack as i said see theyre getting our table ready for us you know dick were really special he lit a cigarette ran his eyes the length of the diner with a detached clinical look like a surgeon preparing to remove the guts of a dying man nobody will be seated at that four its killed i told dick you see the regulations are strict evervthing according to rule nothing crude theyve got a standard i know this station the waiter has certain duties look at him build up steam poor bastard he doesnt want to lose money from his white passengers on his station but he doesnt want to lose money on us either he wants to serve us but hes caught up in the whole goddamned system and must play his role the waiter began to clear the four then the deuce was empty the steward said just a minute sir getting to you aside he whispered to the harassed waiter clear the deuce not knowing i understood the lingo the waiter snarled im going as fast as i can youre putting me up a tree he picked up a tray of dirty dishes and muttered dont put me up a tree returning from the pantry the waiter whipped our table into shape tossed the clean cloth on the table laid down the gleaming silver the whole setup the steward with visible relief seated us dick slipped into the chair against the wall facing the whole dining car and i was seated opposite him it was magic as i sat down the steward slipped behind me as though to pull out my seat to give me splendid service and with one smooth movement of his arm slid the curtain behind me right to the edge of our table magic with the grace of a ballet dancer the steward moved across to the four straightened the one rose in the slender vase and with the same economy of movement reached up and swished the curtain across the back of that table that table was dead they could not fill it there were not that many negroes on the train this waiters tips would suffer he was getting it in the neck along with us i didnt know what to tip him no use to ask dickhe wouldnt know or care the steward gave us our mealchecks menus a polite smile bow and left the waiter served us well when we had finished eating the steward came to total our checks he spoke to the waiter and now that the pressure was gone the black mans voice his demeanor his entire personalityhad gone through a metamorphosis as we lingered over coffee dick said did you notice that waiter when he talked to the steward yeah sure poor black devil his voice went up two octaves and his testicles must have jumped two inches into his stomach yes i guess so dick persisted he does that to emasculate himself to make himself more feminine less masculine more acceptable to a white man it was so obvious so shockingly true and so graphically stated that i laughed oh hell dont probe his guts youre right but youre spoiling my breakfast i complained a four days later we boarded the train looking forward to the ease of a compartment for it had been a frantic and hectic time at fisk and we were exhausted we thought we had a bedroom but dis w covered a mixup in our reservations we complained vigorously but had to settle for an upper and lower berth we flipped and dick won so i climbed to the upper berth in the middle of the night i got up to go to the john and as i climbed down the ladder i noticed a light through the curtain dick was lying on the bed fully clothed except for his jacket reading a book what the hell arent you going to sleep i inquired when im below the masondixon line i want more between me and white people than a curtain i want iron and steel richard wright was a decisive incisive powerful intellectual giant a prophetic writer he is being rediscovered for wright dealt with the major issues and questions of all timeswith the deep meaning of mans existence with the nature of the feelings thoughts and emotions of oppressed people with mans inhumanity to man the cast of wrights characters were black but the plot is eternal was life simply fever feeling without knowing seeking without finding he grew thin and his eyes held the red blood of his body after this anguished question felt by bigger thomas and this vivid expression of the failure and turning inward of his sensory yearnings native son closes with an interchange between the condemned man and his lawyer max that has never been completely analyzed a close comparison with albert camus existentialist novelette the strangerincluding such related images as droning and stuttering such related characters as camus priest and wrights preacher and such related themes as knowledgethroughdeath and the artificiality of all courtroom trialswould advance the critical establishment toward a professionally full understanding of book three especially native son has had many admirers for thoroughly defensible reasons its racial passion and sociological and psychological richness so complement wrights other signal achievementsblack boy and uncle toms children among othersthat none of a succeeding generation of black novelists has been able to replace him in the esteem of his fellow writers the excellence of wrights work however still needs to be minutely analyzed the phrase protest literature no matter what adjectives surround it reveals almost nothing of the permanent virtues of native sonalthough those virtues are profoundly anchored in blackness in racial oppression and in the militant spirit of the author native son is a novel of remarkable agony individualized in bigger thomas yet universalized in ways grievously recognizable over a quarter of a century later on almost every page by negro readers especially the question of how the author transmitted such power and truth should have been perfectly answered by now to observe that wright suffered keenly from racism and wrote feelingly about his experiences is merely to repeat what might equally be said of many black writers wrights racial fire is widely known and it has long warmed a race in need of strong voices the still challenging question however is literary by what verbal techniques did the author help bigger thomas make the reader peep through his knothole in the fence and understand his feelings about his existence bigger did not want to die without being understood by somebody and richard wright has bequeathed one large means of understanding each bigger thomas among us the very thing that bigger hungered for after his capture that vast configuration of images and symbols whose magic and power could lift him up and make him live so intensely that the dread of being black and unequal would be forgotten it is more than aestheticism that argues the value of images and symbols in biggers life largely existential in his perceptions bigger knows himself and his environment most surely through images when despairing he sees his life as an obscene joke happening amid a colossal din of siren screams and white faces and circling lances of light under a cold and silken sky when bigger is walking with bessie his mind could feel the soft swing of her body a young man consumed always with a body hunger sensitive bigger is vulnerable even to a ray of sunshine in his cell near the end of the novel a shaft of yellow sun cut across his chest with as much weight as a beam forged of lead with a convulsive gasp he bent forward and shut his eyes he yearns for wholeness of experiencemade possible only when his feelings merge with some equivalent object around hima yearning graphically portrayed when lying on his cot in jail biggers hands were groping fumblingly through the city of men for something to match the feelings smoldering in him viewed internally as a conflict of forces he is physically a centrally expanding impulse always throbbing but seldom countered by anything outside of him to meet it and explain it the symbolic cast of biggers mind is often made clear for example while he hides in an empty building a chunk of bread in his pocket and his gun nestled under his shirt against his chest are described as symbolic of his rejection of folk religion biggers tragedy his abortive sense of power a power born of a latent capacity to live is made palpable to the reader primarily through the sharing of his many images charged with terror native son then enables the reader to live with a black man of feeling in the truest sense of the phrase a young american whose specific ambition is to merge himself with others and be a part of this world to lose himself in it so he could find himself to be allowed a chance to live like others even though he was black the constant frustration of that simple ambition and of the feelings supporting it is the psychological substance of the novel the network of images that most authentically attend that daily frustrationand their personal racial and national significanceis the jamesian stuff of consciousness to be conveyed a few miscellaneous techniques serving that end might be briefly mentioned images of light and dark as expected recur frequently without special emphasis the light in the dalton house is hardly ever ratural it is a bright flood in the kitchen a room important in racial history is dim elsewhere in the home and is hallucinatory and glaring in the semihuman furnace images of snow often suggest biggers complex connectionsincluding aesthetic oneswith the white world when he leaps from the daltons window after the discovery of marys bones for example the shock of his fall went through him up his back to his head and he lay buried in a cold pile of snow dazed snow was in his mouth eyes ears snow was seeping down his back a related type of imagery temperature contrasts such as biggers despairing wonder about the warm red blood here and cold blue sky there marks the protagonists awareness of paradox in his surroundings natural images of those surroundings used for the sake of sensory appeal unrelated to biggers mood of the moment occur fewer than five times in the whole novel other images of nature are even more rarely thematic and the exception is interesting after bessies murder bigger lifted her feeling the wind screaming a protest against him finally what might be called intestinal imagery is skillfully used the repeated image of marys severed head urgent in biggers feelings rather than merely sensational on the page catches fully the ambivalence and sensory horror that drive him similarly effective are pictures of the demonic furnace with its muffled breathing of the fire the furnace emphatically described about times stands in the middle range of key images found in native son that almost living demandingtobefed gorge whispers and sucks in its air as bigger sucks in air during his many moments of fearful tension and no air can get through the furnace while bigger stands breathless before the imminent discovery of marys bones her earring and the hatchet blade the full identification of the furnace activities with biggers own bodily sensations was incipient earlier when he neared collapse after sticking his ransom note under the daltons door a wave of numbness spread fanwise from his stomach over his entire body making his mouth gap here the furnace mouth that bigger has often peeked anxiously into becomes his own mouth and the fanshaped grate of glowing coals becomes his burning stomach later as the incredulous newsman pokes at the bones in the furnace ashes bigger himself was a huge furnace now through which no air could go and the fear that surged into his stomach was like the fumes of smoke that had belched from the ash bin and as bigger runs from the house the inside of his stomach glowed whitehot the identification persists as bigger notices newspaper headlines while walking to bessies room resenting the failure of newsmen to take any interest in his storymeaning his very lifeas long as it had remained buried and burning in his own heart a rather peculiar image reminiscent of its striking usage by chekhov in ward no occurs slightly more often than that of the furnace the picture of an excited bigger standing in the middle of the floor he leaps to this position at bessies when he wonders if he can trust her and when he wonders if the police are questioning his family at that very moment he takes the same stance in his own room when he discovers that he has forgotten to burn his incriminating gloves pencil and paper and he moves to the center of his jail cell when he is excited about the revelations of his first long talk with his lawyer max and again minutes later when he first tries to see himself in relation to other men the meaning of these postures is specified when bigger fearfully embarrassed by the addition of his servile family and friends to the ranks of staring white people the whole cast of the novel already standing in his cell was so tense in body and mind that when the door swung in he bounded up and stood in the middle of the room this peculiar image then pictorially frames some of biggers moments of maximum tension and freezes him at the point of maximum flight within areas that restrict his movement or thought daily trapped in corners and pockets on chicagos south side at crucial instants bigger needs spaceat least that semblance of it represented by equidistance and centrality a subtler geometric pattern comparable to effects achieved by nathaniel hawthorne in the marble faun emerges when bigger appears at the center of another figure the christian cross at the inquest with one policeman on each side of him and with two in front and two behind totaling six and therefore matching the number of jurors bigger moves ironically at the center of a cross afterwards speeding through the streets toward the dalton home for a bullying interrogation bigger rides with one officer seated on each side of him and with six police cars in front and a similar string behind carried thus is the middle of an elongated crucifix realistically adjusted to the spatial restrictions of traffic while bigger is resisting in the dalton home the imposition of a false charge of rape he confuses a cross being burned atop a building on the other side of the street with the cross recently hung around his neck by his mothers minister reverend hammond thinking that a holy cross should not be burned but hearing outside the cries burn im and kill im bigger suddenly knows that he is not looking at the cross of christ but the cross of the ku klux klan he had a cross of salvation round his throat and they were burning one to tell him that they hated him just as his body had metaphorically become the furnace it becomes the cross when a jailer attributes his rebellion against the religious symbol to communist dogma thats a goddamn lie bigger shouted his body seemed a flaming cross as words boiled hysterically out of him after bigger throws his cross awav three times the au w thors condensed metaphor shows the meaning of these several pages in book three bigger reflects that the cross the preacher had hung round his throat had been burned in front of his eyes wright takes pains with less noticeable images such is the case with his depiction of eyes as emblems of blindness and guilt exclusive of his many pictures of the blind mrs dalton strangely liberated by his accidental murder of mary bigger thinks about nearby people waiting for street cars he did not look at them they were simply blind people blind like his mother his brother his sister peggy britten jan mr dalton and the sightless mrs dalton and the quiet empty houses with their black gaping windows those blind houses in the ghetto according to biggers feelings have stares like that of the daltons white cat that leaped upon his shoulder in front of photographers in the basement when marys bones were discovered its big round black eyes twin pools of secret guilt and like that of the murdered bessie staring at him with those round large black eyes her bloody mouth open in awe and wonder and pain to a person like bigger his life reduced to occasional sensory joys snuffed out by a constant overbalance of pain images of the corruption of the eyehis only receptor of magnitudewould disturbingly crowd his mind two kinds of images are thematically as well as numerically impressive in native son each found in various passages between fifteen and twenty times the type discernible slightly less often the blotout image shares the powers of physical violence upon its initial appearance the day bigger first comes to drexel boulevard and wants to wave his hand and blot out mr dalton for making him feel embarrassed or failing in that to blot himself out using the same or quite similar words bigger wants to blot out a number of people and things before the novel ends this list of people includes negroes because they never act in unity catching the i mind and body in certainty and faith whites because they are measuring every inch of his weakness and all the people at the inquest because they look at and cause him to look at bessies corpse but biggers destructive impulse as made known through this kind of image is usually aimed elsewhere it is aimed for example at inactivity planning the ransom note he does not need to dance and sing and clown over the floor in order to blot out a day and night of doing nothing it is aimed at sound blotted out by the roaring noise in his ears for instance when he hates britten so hard and hot for being a bigot at fear blotted out by his sudden confidence when he eats breakfast with his family and thinks of how blind they were and at death itself a different and bigger adversary than the white mountain of vengeful society in a reversal of this variety of imagery white society itself becomes an arbitrary agent of the blottingout impulse surrounding bigger for it feels that nothing short of a quick blotting out of his life would make the city safe again all of society colludes in such destruction points out max your honor injustice blots out one form of life but another grows up in it place with its own rights needs and aspirations max himself however his hat jammed on his head in that subtle last scene of the novel has in effect blotted out of his head all the words from bigger that he did not want to hear those expressions of the black prisoners superior humanity that outdistanced communist dogma the other kind of image thematic in native son with about equal frequency is the white blur and its variant forms biggers certainty of the color and his uncertainty regarding the substance of these sense impressions invest them with a degree of pathos and irony blind mrs dalton always dressed in white both a victim and an object of faulty external perception is typically a white blur standing by the door silent ghostlike other people pictorially share her color and meaning while bigger stands bewildered by his discovery that he has killed mary a vast city of white people blurs the reality of the room while viewing his picture in the newspaper in which the white cat perches accusingly on his shoulder bigger feels that the whole vague white world would track him down and while he is being cruelly dragged and cursed and stamped in the snow he dimly sees around him an array of faces white and looming an implicit image of the white blur and a source of monumental frustration in bigger thomas and in many of his progenyis voiced by max who tells the judge that the prisoner had no notion before he murdered and he has none now of having been wronged by any spe cific individuals material objects in the white world also appear as blurs the reader slowly realizes that the whiteowned cars that whirred over the smooth black asphalt shot past them at high speed and zoomed past on swift rubber tires early in the novel have been varicolored forerunners of the white blur when images like the white flash of a dozen silver bulbs occur the mass image of the newsmen in the basement has a manifold significance a reversal like that observed in the blotout images appears in the use of the white blur states attorney buckley himself part of the white blur urges the death penalty to enable whites to sleep in peace tonight to know that tomorrow will not bring the black shadow of death over the homes and lives the sentence of death brings another reversal a counter image to biggers perception as he understands every word while reacting only to the judges white face his eyes not blinking the blur now disappears from the language of the novel clarified by its own revealed deadlinessto recur implicitly and indirectly only once transformed into a new adversary for bigger the opaqueness in the mind of max that blurs his deeper awareness of his client by far the most numerous and the most meaningful wrights closely related images of the wall and the curtain widely distributed in over fifty separate passages in native son deserve a closer study than is possible here but their categories thirteen in number at least can be indicated when ranked according to frequency of usage the wallcurtain as a shield of indifference and detachment emphasized in eleven different passages is predominant on the first morning of the novel bigger has lurked behind his curtain of indifference snapping and glaring at whatever had tried to make him come out into the open several such images cluster on the pages describing biggers capture where the reader sees him trapped on the icy water tank going behind his curtain his wall looking out with sullen stares of contempt behind his curtain now looking down at himself freezing under the impact of water in subzero winds and when his fingers are too stiff to pick up his gun something laughed in him cold and hard he was laughing at himself the final such image in the novel is especially interesting biggers eyes were wide and unseeing his voice rushed on as he explains to max important things about his life and recent actions that max really does not want to hear bigger is walling max out of his perceptions so that he bigger can better gauge with his feelings whether his own tone is carrying his meaning it had been maxs tone in court not his words that had made him believe that max knew how he felt a category of wallcurtain images used somewhat less often and used negatively is one reflecting or the artificial separation of certain classes of people bigger for classes of people bigger for example rides in the front seat of the dalton car between two vast white looming walls mary and jan the suggestion of protectiveness in this kind of image disappears from the novel after white but honest jan has approached bigger flung aside the curtain and walked into the room of his life a passage important also for its metaphor showing biggers life as a room and therefore enhancing the meaning of every wallcurtain image thus reversed the image later pictures bigger trying to break down walls to reach other people one of the most gratifying passages in the novel employs such an image when the prisoner wonders whether if his hands were electric wires and his heart a battery and if he reached out through these stone walls and felt other hands would there be a reply a shock not that he wanted those hearts to turn their warmth to him but just to know that they were there and warm and in that touch response of recognition there would be union identity a wholeness which had been denied him all his life similarly moved by his new insight bigger wonder how he can break down this wall of isolation between him and max whom he now sees upon another planet far off in space and he apprehensively tells max that maybe the wall between him and other men will still be there when he is executed ill be feeling and thinking that they didnt see me and i didnt see them an early expression of ralph ellisons invisible man theme the remaining subdivisions of the wallcurtain image spread throughout approximately passages need not be illustrated by more excerpts to document the variety and authenticity in this area of wrights style nevertheless the following list of the subdivisions ranked again according to their frequency of use should be informative the other figurative walls and curtains then vividly represent the suppression of certain feelings hatred resentment and mistrust the stunting or perversions of intelligence and imagination the withering of familial and friendly affection the ineffectiveness of certain barriers the deprivation of fundamental human needs natural barriers entrapment deceit defensive counterfeelings and the acceptance of certain isolation a knowledge of all the images in native son does not produce automatically a knowledge of bigger thomas and bigger himself feels more than he thinks concluding at last existentially that his feelings are the surest guide to truth and to morality but when i think of why all the killing was he says apparently including all the fancied killings of his life i begin to feel what i wanted what i am to know what and why a man desires and to know what he is is the deepest human engagement of our faculties the furnace the trembling poise in the middle of the room the crucifix the haunting blind eyes the wish to blot out the white blur of the hater and avenger and the looming wall so massively effective and yet so useless and wrongall these images metaphorically dramatize part of the black mans american experience and native son preserves them for us to feel and to believe perhaps not knowing wright makes it possible for me to evaluate his works objectively certainly we know of his influence on baldwin george lamming and others ralph ellison is not the least of these one has only to compare ellisons invisible man the start of it to wrights short story the man who lived underground it has been reported more than once that ellison admitted his debt to wright this has always been reported secondhand ellison himself to my knowledge has never done it in public i found pagan spain to be one of wrights most perceptive books and frequent travelers to spain would do well to read it if it can be found wright had no particular stake in spain except as a human being interested in the plight of other human beings this marked a very special growth i think and it is the kind of growth all black writers must move towardfrom the burning consideration of the black oppressed to the final consideration of all oppressed peoples in the final analysis it is this consideration that makes wright the most important black writer american of all times it is after all amusing to reread wright and to find that he has said so succinctly if not always quite correctly but with the awesome power he employed what so many of us are trying clumsily to say today it really makes you want to quit trying he has said it all so well who among the current crop have been so bold as to explore the ramifications of racism in america europe africa and asia no one there is one final consideration now that wright is dead how we line up to celebrate his gifts now that he offers us no competition how wonderful he was we say the prejudice and discrimination in publishing makes us jealous of the tiny and very dispensable positions we hold in it only we can change that and i suggest that in memory of richard wright we cease scuffling amongst ourselves to attain what in the end is illusory anyway to the very end of his days as great as he was wright was pressed for bread demeaningly pressed for it if things go on as they are the end will be the same for each and every one of us lets change them lets salute next time the living like chester himes before he goes without our best wishes admiration and a medal with a field of collard greens rampant and chitlins diagonal for having written the good fight if others care to assume my mental stance and through empathy duplicate the atmosphere in which i speak wrote p richard wright in one of his last books white man listen cfd gm they can imaginatively grasp the factors in my environment and a sense of the impulses motivating me they will if they are of a mind be able to see more or less what ive seen will be capable of apprehending the same general aspects and tones of reality that comprise my world part of the reality that comprised his world at the time the words were written was the experience of some thirty years in the united states a decade in paris and travel in parts of europe africa asia and latin america all of it had given him a focus that few black americans at the time tried to accept or understand either for the benefit of ourselves the world or for richard wright and many whites have not accepted or tried to understand it since he was before his time and as all men who break forth with the truth before the world seems to be ready for it he sufferedchided misunderstood accused of abandoning america and its racial problem for another orbit dying finally before some of the predictions he made about the future would come true his death in at the beginning of a decade in transition for america africa and asiaall three about which he had written so muchbrought the end of a literary career that had produced published books innumerable poems short stories essays book reviews dramatic works and speeches in the late forties he had chosen to take leave of the u s the country in which he had been a secondclass citizen but where in his own way he had always been one step ahead together with his wife and young daughter he now finally left it all behind before leaving he had written five books depicting americas racial situation the american decade that followedbringing mccarthyism the korean war the eisenhower era and the long overdue supreme court desegregation ruling of was one in which because he had once been a communist he would have been made to suffer but perhaps with a gift of prophecy the mccarthy days found him away interpreting the racial situation in other areas he was in bandung writing his own analysis on the future of asia and africa and in africa making notes for a book on the colonial heritage of the gold coast ghana his book on africa in black_power antedated by years the two words stokely carmichael turned into a now famous phrase and told of kwame nkrumah before most of the world had heard of him or could pronounce his name he took his family off to paris during a period when he and his jewish wife ellen could not without harassment and embarrassment rent property in new yorks greenwich village or buy it in new england when lynchings in the south were still not uncommon when jim crowism in the south and in many places in the north was still written into law and when he was the preeminent black figure in american letters not only because he was talented but because only one black writer at a time especially in richard wrights time could be eminent in american letters he had been forced to become a spokesman for a black population of then people all the conditions of living and writing in such an atmosphere had become too much finallyafter first one visit to france in followed by a brief return to the united states then a decision to go to france soon after to liveexile became the answer from his first departure until the appearance of the outsider in no new book from richard wright would come for eight years the last to be published before it would be his autobiographical black boy in the interim years as seen later were crucial to a new phase of his career and some of the most valuable if the least acclaimed of his works would come after this period of silence ellen wright the late authors widow told me in paris in during an informal talk about the writers work my husband didnt write for almost seven years he was reading then were her affectionate and rather quiet wordshe was reading reading reading his silence in a way that silence can be golden gave him a new psychological distance and perspective that some black americansthose who have it and have revealed ithave come to usually in only one of three ways through serving as we would discover through malcolm_x time in prison or by going as ralph ellisons invisible man did in a sense underground or as with richard wright by living for a time in exile it does not usually happen by living in the mainstream of american life but by living outside it out of the period of richard wright in parismidway between africa and americahe emerged to reveal not only what it meant to be a black american but the meaning of being a black man in the western world and with this discovery he probed not only himself and his past but the western psychein a way that no black writer in the u s had ever probed it or been able to probe it or in quite the same way has probed it since he knew and understood what slavery had done in america and he discovered what colonialism had done in africa and asiaa lesson which american history hiding both the legend of slave revolts and the colonial west had not wholly taught him he learned it himself and nearly a decade after his death that same lesson is being taught now only because the independence of africa and asia the war in vietnam and a new black militancy have all made it a lesson which can no longer be ignored he became as men in exile do a cultural interloper living between two worlds and as a black man africa inevitably would become part of one or both those worlds to come face to face with this reality is to assume loyalty to one world or the other or to become a neutral and richard wright in his outlook and stance from all indications had become something of the lattera neutral man though were he living now it might well have changed but in in white man listen he would tell us im not nonwestern im no enemy of the west neither am i an easterner when i look out upon those vast stretches of this earth inhabited by brown black and yellow mensections of the earth in which religion dominates to the exclusion of everything else the emotional and mental landscapemy reactions and attitudes are those of the west i see both worlds from another and third point of view to set his later work beside that of frantz fanon or the later web du bois after his expatriation of ghana wright by comparison is neither a panafricanist nor a revolutionary and to some black american militants for whom fanon has become both hero and revolutionary example wright today would not quite offer the same appeal both writers died within a year of the otherwright at in and fanon at in and it is impossible not in some way to compare their messages as quite different whereas wright three years before his death would pen the words the west must aid and yes abet the delicate and tragic elite in asia and establish national areas of living fanon was telling us at almost the same time though he would not until much later be translated into english as for us who have decided to break the back of colonialism our historic mission is to sanction all revolts all desperate actions all those abortive attempts in rivers of blood neither man however spared the newly liberated bourgeois african who was the first to exploit the masses at the end of colonial rule but wright unlike fanon despite what some may argue and what richard wright may have believed himself to be was no revolutionary in the sense that like fanon he preached and sanctioned global revolt wright a forerunner on paper courageous and the father of the black american literary revolution had few contemporary rivals but his work when put beside that of some black american writers today would be considered mild in tone and message to say the least but it was he who as a kind of franctireur of the black literary vanguard had given us the first warningwho years before the report from the presidents commission on civil disorders was ever thought of had presented to us all that it could ever say with his native son and before the first signs of neocolonialism would appear along with what some now call wars of liberation occurring in countries of third world he was trying to give the message of how to avoid holocaust with white man listen exile had made him at one with himself much of the outspoken state of rage and the tone of protest is absent from his later essays and rather than a polemicist he had become a social critic in residence and travel abroad he saw and understood the three ms of western collusion as he called themmissionaries merchants and mercenariesand he spoke out against them but he had come to believe essentially in mans humanity to man that the west might finally end up being less selfish than it had been for years that the future offered hope however he became in spite of it all in the end one of the most misunderstood black writers of all time he was finally criticized by africans who believed he had misinterpreted africa and flayed also by many american blacks who insisted he had lost touch with the american reality whatever that means in a country which then as now has reality defined by hollywood television madison avenue public relations and two political parties so similar as to be indistinguishable and if he was misunderstood by blacks he was resented as much as a black man could ever be resented by countless whites those who could accept uncle toms children native son bright and morning star twelve million black voices and black boy but could not have a black man tamper with the western myth in literature as in life if white critics could have their way he was to keep his placewrite about what it was like to be black in mississippi or on the south side of chicago and leave the moral judgments about africa asia and socalled western civilization to the white civilizers he had turned his back on the american dream and gone into exile and the white literary establishment began to drop him and politically he would learn that a black american abroad was to be anything but an independent international voice having any overtones of politics if any speaking or writing about america or western policy was to be done it was supposed to be done on a state department tour his travels however produced books inspired them and brought speeches between trips to africa and asia he traveled widely in spain a country he admitted having ignored because of franco and fascism but finally visited at the advice of gertrude stein who shortly before her death told him in paris what he later wrote in pagan spain dick you ought to go to spain youll see the past there youll see what the western world is made of he saw in spain much of what he saw in africa and asia the reasons christianity had been able to triumph why it could do so over one people and not another and why spain still bound by religious traditions of the th century and by an unquestioning conscience had permitted religion for four centuries to overlap every facet of spanish life he found it like no other country in europe in the th century and he named it pagan spain where james baldwin would tell us what it felt like as a black man to gaze at the cathedral of chartres or to look upon his past in a way that made him despise black people because they had failed to produce rembrandt richard wright would give us the foibles and contradictions of how western mankind lived religion and race and the meaning of tradition played a greater role in his interpretation of europe africa and asia than politics or economics although in apropos preposessions an introduction to black_power he noted he would use throughout the book a marxist analysis of the historical events that had transpired throughout the last five centuries in one part of africa he analyzed finally more through the doctrines of race and religion than through marxist ideology much the same approach is to be found in pagan spain white man listen and a book on the meeting of afroasian nations in indonesia which he entitled in the colour curtain a report on the bandung conference made obvious in his work is his own knowledge that he traveled through countries as an outsider marginally he saw what insiders are not in a position to see and he showed us what no european no asian or no african traveling in the same places could interpret in quite the same way he had acquired as outsider a double vision and he knew it this double vision of mine he wrote in white man listen stems from my being a product of western civilization and for my racial identity long and deeply conditioned this condition of being born western and a man of color creates a psychological distance so to speak between me and my environment at bandung at what he called the meeting of the rejected he was present as a westerner and man of color who had known rejection i feel my life has given me some keys he wrote in the colour curtain to what they would say or do im an american negro as such ive had a burden of race consciousness and like many of those from the nations represented he had a religious background and had been a communist out of the bandung trip came a document encompassing asia africa the left the right race religion communism and all the values of the western world and for all the reasons it was unique he would have trouble finding a publisher the dutch and french did not want it for reasons which need no explanation his own american publisher harpers refused it publication came finally in england as thesiswhether one agrees or not with its presentationit is to be recognized as courageous courageously attempted and courageously written the bandung conference scorned by most of the western world as its judgment day found the then u s secretary referring to it on the american news media before it happened as the socalled afroasian conference and with the approaching united states role in vietnam where american advisors at the time of bandung were already moving in swiftly behind the french it was no doubt judged at the time by many as too political a book for an american author to write or to have writtenespecially if he was black an expatriate and had once been an avowed communist for all the control he had over his life and times richard wright was an honest writer but as a black man living in exile in the capital of the western world his intellectual honesty for all its intent could not be quite as complete as the desire for it before his death he had lived years in francethe france of a colonial policy in asia and africa the france which had fought to keep indochina french at dienbienphu and battled to crush algerian nationalists in setif kabylia and algiers and though the history of french colonial policy was to be deemed no better or worse than that of the british whom he admonished in black_power the same author who traveled to bandung one year after dienbienphu and had lived in france throughout the algerian war had watched french colonialism go down unwillingly and in defeat and he had remained silent about it but unless part of his life was to become a contradiction he had little other choice through no fault of his own part of the paradox of black americans living in western countries with a colonial history is that to remain silent about it implies a complicity in it for lack of choice rather than complicity as wright showed silence is usually the result but if as camus once wrote by our silence or the stand we take we too enter the fray richard wright for lack of choice had unwillingly entered the fray he had not chosen to be born a westerner it had been thrust upon him and he had been as much westerner in america with its stain of slavery as in europe with its blot of colonialism but unlike fanon who a black french citizen from martinique could attack the french renounce citizenship and did preaching revolution against the french richard wright black american expatriate in france man with a passport but no longer really with a country was doomed to silence about french colonial policy lest he become an unwelcome alien on adopted soil for the moral and intellectual dilemma in which he would inevitably find himself but which he never admitted the french with a history of such moral dilemma long ago introduced the word for it richard wright would become a man in engrenage caught up unwillingly in a situation in which there was little choice but the same choice he had believed himself though essentially a free manan alien liberated on foreign soilunbound by tradition habit culture or country and in a way that he never quite revealedthough it is between the lines of his later workliving in europe had contributed to a mental state of freedom in more ways than being free from racial oppression no longer forced to live by the values of american society nor responsible to think or act according to the traditions of europe and economically independent he was free to create his own values becoming as free perhaps as a black man could ever be free as a citizen of the western world the freedom which gave him his double vision permeated his nonfiction but in fiction neither vision nor freedom would be quite as complete for the same reasons he had acquired freedom in nonfiction he revealed in fiction what can happen to the black writer as foreigner cut off from the sources of the past remembering but no longer living them his characters became cultural interlopers in no work of fiction written abroad during yearsinclusive of short stories of which there were fewer than novelsdid he penetrate european life or but barely bring any of his characters into it the first novel written in europe the outsider is set alternately in chicago harlem and greenwich village the second savage holiday all of whose characters are white and american has a setting in new york city the third the long dream his last published novel and the first in which he attempted to bring a character into french lifebut has him arriving and going no furtheris the story of fishbelly who decides to leave his native mississippi where the storys action is set and takes a plane for paris in writing what he knew bestmississippi chicago harlem and greenwich village all places he had livedhe did what most black writers who go to paris to live and write do not usually choosing paris as a place to write about the varied works of chester himes and james baldwin written there to name only two are other examples of it wright used paris and mentioned other european locales in his fiction in the way that most american writers have as a backdrop a mood but not a way of life for it to be otherwise is by necessity to have plunged into european life learned its language and its ways in order to transform the experience into fiction if not an american just as wright did writes only of americans in europe a character comes goes but never comes aliveor as with his fishbelly only arrives and because to become more than a foreigner and an onlooker in europe takes time and worktime and work which if one is writing for a livelihood as was richard wright is time which must be spent writingwhat usually comes into american fiction is what he brought the past rather than the present for some black americans to do otherwise as may have also happened to richard wright is an obstacle for both personal and racial reasons to enter the life of europe rather than remain on the periphery to master a foreign language requires submission by its nature to be forced to learn everything over again to do in rome as the romans do accustomed to doing at home in the white mans world some black americans are abroad to escape it rather than enter into it in any way even if not for the same reasons they thus remain outside in the company of each othergathering in favorite cafes keeping company with others who seek the same existing in an expatriate colony richard wright shortly before his death had written a novel island of halluci nation as a sequel to fishbelly on the paris expatriate colony of the fifties the story of its infiltration by espionage agents many of them blacks spying on blacks for the cia his american publisher never took it without a doubt he knew the inner life of the america expatriate colony in paris better than he probably ever realized except for close friends the french he was married to an american lived as an american american familystyle speaking english he read in english probably more often than not and wrote in english and it is more likely that to a worldfamous writer french friends conversed with him in english more often than he was called upon to put his thoughts to them into french the french the most xenophobic of all europeans toward foreignersother than his close friends and the companionship of french intellectuals among them sartre and simone de beauvoirwere not the easiest people for him to know his whole experience abroad however seemed to affect his work in one way or another and much of it a period of adaptability as painful as writing he had undertaken as he would discover himself the most difficult task for a writer to pull up roots in one place and transplant them in another and still turn out valuable work and for a black writer even as prolific as richard wright the experience would not be the same as for ernest hemingway gertrude stein f scott fitzgerald or some lesser american writers who also chose exileand have since been eulogized in a way that wright never has whether at his death he found his exile worth it we will never really know it is more likely he did but those who choose exile dont usually tell us otherwise had he been a less important literary figure or as some american writers who have gone to europe unknown and subsequently become known the issue might not count for so much but rather than an obscure talent he was a major american author who chose europe not only as a place to write but also to spend the rest of his life and whatever he produced later would be judged accordingly unlike james baldwin a relatively unknown writer until he came home to america richard wrights career assumed another burden to compare the works of baldwin and wright as simply two black american writers who lived in paris at the same time is not important they are too different to make an important comparison except that this viewer has for a long time maintained that much of the commercial american success of james baldwin was somewhat due to his attack upon richard wright in part also to his return home which wright even for burial had chosen not to do and because those who set standards of giving titular head to black writers for public consumption elected to give it to james baldwin at wrights death had baldwin remained in europe longer than his year duration he might still be unknown to the american reading public upon his return to america he had written already three books and the fourth published soon after his return nobody knows my name was probably the most fitting title that might have been chosen if for no other reason than to compare the works of baldwin and wright as two black writers who lived abroad there is the necessity to compare them as they now seem to appear during this day when black has achieved an unparalleled vogue in the american popularity syndromeinclusive of writers books on sale if the two are compared as two black writers both equally famous some distinct differences become apparent on the commercial market as to who is being promoted and who isnt the works of james baldwin are all presently available in paperback the works of richard wright in paperback are uncle toms children native son and black boy the only work written abroad paperback or otherwise presently available is white man listen none of the rest are for sale at all but are out of print that wright is dead and baldwin alive would appear as a consequence except that many more american writers dead long before wright are far more accessible in american libraries and bookstores his complete works appear to be available now only in private collections at the schomburg collection in harlem and in the moreland room of howard university the library of congress might also be a complete source except black_power has been omitted from its card catalogue it is known that his later books were not well received in america though most were being translated into foreign languages and accepted well abroad toward wrights downward slide in the united states james baldwin attempted to add what could only appear as a final push he had already made an attempt with everybodys protest novel in notes of a native son during wrights lifetime but it looked as if finally he had been told that to become king of the jungle is to first kill the lion what he did was to throw the corpse of a man who had befriended him to the lions his now famous alas poor richard nobody knows my name after wrights death was probably his greatest literary coup with the establishment outside publication of letter from a region in my mind published as part of the fire next time in the madison avenueminded the new yorker as an example of how far he went with that establishment and how far wright didnt go this writer who had both the good fortune and misfortune of working for the new yorker some years ago suggested in as a possible story for talk of the town that the magazine do a conversation with ellen wright then in new york city for the first time in years and visiting the u s especially for the march on washington the new yorker editor william shawn answered with a polite but abject no encircled with his initial and that was that james baldwin could appear in the magazine book length but a conversation with the widow of richard wright no over a year later in paris i personally interviewed the authors widow myself for a swedish newspaper she had words then on among other subjects james baldwin and the alas poor richard essay they are perhaps more apropos here since she wanted known what her husband was no longer alive or in america to say the disagreements baldwin writes of she said were onesided my husband never indulged in public criticism or open arguments with james baldwin he always considered him baldwin a valuable contribution with the makings of a major talent everything baldwin had to say of him he wright said time and events will settle the course its just unfortunate that certain statements baldwin has made date since the death of richard wright and that they seem an attempt to change his image and create a new one posthumously it is doubtful that the image of richard wright could be affected permanently through the work of james baldwin although the effort seems to have been made more than not that the content and perhaps the volume of the late authors work would have been different had he never left the united states there is no longer any question it would have been different in the way byrons would have been had he never left england joyces had he never left ireland or henry james had he never left america he never produced in a vacuum but he left america and he didnt return he was an expatriate from a land whose foundation is expatriatism and whose heritage is the sons and daughters of expatriates and exslaves as a lonely and troubled intellectual he left his own testament of that heritageof africa of europe and americaa testament from him that had he never left we would not in the same way have had and he passed it on with a vision that was the first and perhaps the last of its kind we may see again from a black american writer in this generation wright it was a man t mes frc s seems important kpt rsk that this fact be re membered in the new times at the beginning of what already has been labeled as the new black renaissance when richard wright was born in mississippi most black americans lived in the southand not in the urban south at that as he grew up the great migration north was reaching its first peak but the southparticularly mississippiremained very much as it had been since the end of reconstruction the differ ence between slavery and voluntary servitude was minimal black people still had few rights which white men were bound to respect and the price of survival was bitter adjustment to this fact richard wright spent his childhood and early youth learning the rules of survival eventually he too joined the northward trek and his road led to chicago there in carl sandburgs city of the big shoulders the young mississippian found that the suburbs of his states mentality stretched the length and breadth of the land and that there was no physical journey he could make that would leave him beyond its limits he reached out to whatever refuge there was andfor a long and crucial timehe thought he found an escape in communism that in any case anchored him and freed the clamoring urge to art locked in his tortured psyche he wrote and the various literary organs of the left recognized his gifts and published his works then in when he was he published the novel native son which was to break many precedents for a book by a b ack writer and which made him famous for a while he lived the fe of literary lion in new york but as a literary lion of a certain hue and color made all the d fference after a second book the autobiographical black boy richard wright accepted an invitation from the government of france to come to paris and he went his household now included a wife who was jewish and white and a young daughter julia in france where he was lionized anew richard wright found a kind of freedom it was first of all physical but it also was spiritual and most important of all this freedom had a base which rested on a negatism which his own intelligence must have told him had to be resolved it never really was in any case the writers past had taught him lessons which applied no less to the world and he spoke to the world with several books black_power the color curtain which reflected his insight and his concern time passed another daughter rachel came and richard wright the expatriate hungered for a return to his roots it was this hunger which led him to try a little pathetic farming in the countryside beyond paris fame diminished american publishers grew less interested in his work sinister forces haunted him and finally his health and his marriage were threatened so notoriously s void of honesty is white society in this country that any writer made famous by it is an immediate suspect and if he is a negro writer double suspect black writers who are of extreme value to the black community for example cannot by definition be of much value to white society i am thinking of such writers as leroi tones and eldridge cleaver and conversely white writers of national popularity are the black communitys enemy one might say that a writer of richard wrights status is an exception but let me hasten to add that as a chronic black reader of literature i have felt in reading wrights books a strange uneasiness not about the subhuman puppets dangled before me but about the man controlling these puppetswho is really the booker t washington of american letters and is it not the messianic urge for another b t washington that haunts the white critic like irving howe who can so swiftly conclude that wright is ralph ellisons and james baldwins spirtual father because i had barely survived the dirt farms of north carolina myself i stayed away from wright as long as i could and even after i broke down and read native son and enjoyed it and was surprised even then i felt i was patronizing negro literature when i read baldwin ellison jones or cleaver however i read for mvseif i feel i understand something about myself as a black man and a wr ter i feel involved with these writers lives because they themselves are involved in explaining to themselves and to all who listen to their weird position in white america wright in contrast spent his life explaining someone else ie the bigger thomases to white people indeed bigger existed but not who were anxious to believe that wright himself it is not that the social reality portrayed by wright is false but that in so far as it represents wrights own life it is i do not wish to use the word lie so lets say simply that wright availed himself of a literary convention anyone wishing to view the distance between the benighted bigger thomas and the enlightened richard wright with more accurate measurement should compare for example wrights attitude towards white women in his fiction and his attitude towards them in his biography and his autobiographical works by insisting on the disparity between wrights life and the social reality he created i am not saying that wright was dishonest and that he betrayed however unwittingly the values of the black community rather to emphasize the extent to which literature is dependent for its impetus and impact on literary fashions and conventions one should avoid the implication of wrights social reality that south chicago was worse in the s than it is now wright wrote about chicago in the manner that he did because that was what white america was ready to accept in terms of literary fashion and social imagery or more accurately needed to accept white america branded wright the official negro protester the genuine article to reject him was to reject official genuine negro protest no matter what your own experience as a negro might have been in terms of popularity wright was the great american writer and in europe even more soand probably for the same reason that patch of blue was so popular in denmark i remember walking out of that movie in copenhagen trying to explain to sympathetic danish friends its not that simple i mean its more complex why i rejected the movies reality to reject wrights art is not to reject protest it is to reject negative protest to reject the white mans concept of protest which is that of a raging ferocious uncool demoralized black boy banging on the immaculate door of white society begging not so much for political justice as for his own identity and in the process consuming himself so that in the final analysis his destiny is at the mercy of the white man no to reject wright is not to reject protest it is to reject negative protest every black person who realizes how sick american white society is by the logic of this awareness makes a protest a positive protest this is a delicate point which the oversimplification of wrights social reality has obscured positive protest that creates as it eliminates it deals with the oppositions ugliness by concentrating on its own beauty leroi jones prose is positive protest because it is witty and beautiful to black people which means simply white people cannot understand it black children in the doorways of the ghetto doing the james brown or the uptight are positive protest directed against white people because white people cant dance negro digest is positive protest against the readers digest every ghettoi do not mean slumis positive protest against white insipid suburbs black people together involved with their lives carrying on with their black and bluesy culture is positive protest against the simpleness and the uninterestedness that haunt the abstracted lives of middleclass whites the argument that the value in richard wrights work lies in how well it describes the specific social climate that produced it is nothing more that a rationalization for the mans success and an erroneous one at that for it misses the point that it was wrights attitude towards the negro writer and negro literature that led him to believe there was a gold mine in explaining to white america the lives of black people it was his definition of negro writer that led him to select from his own vast and rich experiences those horrifying scraps from which emerged a dozen or so unbelievably dumb negroes just as the monster was created not by frankenstein but by mary shelley so wrights creation cannot be foisted off on society if we want to get to the key to wrights work we would do best by examining the theories of fiction wright accepted during his day a crucial question in wrights definition of the negro writer had to do with subjectmatter which stated simply that a negro writer was someone who wrote about negro life jesus this would make jessie hill ford nat hentoff robert penn warren and wiliam faulkner negro writers and as though this was not enough there was definite itemized catalog ie setpieces of what constituted negro lifethis of course was a much easier way out than saying negro life is anything that a negro does because this leaves a definition of negro too opened and baby white people werent having that just yet an intellectual life literary success marriage to a white woman for example did not constitute negro life at least not for the white reading public which explains why wright published not one scratch about this aspect of his life in order to see how black writing handles this compare for example the manner in which leroi jones handles these aspects of his life in plays dutchman and the slave wright believed as far too many people still do that there are certain categories which constitute black experience and others white experience that these white and black categories are and this is a shame ascribed with you when you are born and cannot be shaken by individual will for wright it was his damnation to be born black and his will to achieve whitenessie to pull himself up to the literary standards of white america the tenets of black writing today are the reverse of what wright believed for black writing a black writer is first of all black which means simply that he accepts the standards of black people over those of white america every negro baby in america is bom white born that is into a world of white values and if he is to survive that world he has to achieve blackness somewhere in the marrow of his youth must be that experience that awakening that rebirth jesus talked so much about which must carry him over to accept the reality of blackness this journey is ultimately an achievement of both grace and ones own will one must as ellison so strongly insists upon will to be a negro being a negro american involves a willed who wills to be a negro do affirmation of self against all outside pressures but the irving howe types freedom can be fought for but it cannot always be willed or asserted into existence wishes this werent so so then a black writer is not just some colored person trying to prove to white society that he is not a nigger orand that if he is white society is to blame no when we meet the black writer in the pages of his work we encounter someone who has achieved and willed an identity of blackness someone who has accepted negro life not as a burden as ellison puts it but as a discipline subjectmatter then is not part of the criteria in determining a black writer but quality of life will discipline and moral courage are a black writer can write about anything i mean this literally and what he has to say will still be said by a black man as leroi jones puts it if i say i am a black man all my writing is done by a black man whether i label each thing i write written by a black its still written by a black man so that if i point out a bird a black man has pointed out that bird and it is the weight of that experience in me and the way i get it from where it is to you that says whether or not i am a writer anger and beyond p the tragedy of richard wrights life is that he subscribed to a definition of the negro writer that was perniciously paradoxical on the one hand the role of the negro writer as wright saw it allowed him the potent power of the raging satirist while at the very same time rendered him in the last years of his life impotent and exiled it was near impossible for wright to change his ideas about the function of the writer because such ideas were as always intricately woven into the writers definition of his self to me wright as writer was less interesting than the enigma he personified ellison can say that he could so dissociate himself from the complexity of his background while trying so hard to improve the condition of black men everywhere that he could be so wonderful an example of human possibility but could not for ideological reasons depict a negro as intelligent as creative or as dedicated as himself anger and beyond p wrights idea of a negro writer was extremely middleclass which means that he believed that what white society thought to be negro reality was more important than what negroes knew to be their reality wright was exiled because his definition of negro life was too narrow too confining too puny and too dependent on white society wright was afraid to define negro life too broadly for fear it would cease to be negro a weird kind of insecurity ill it was wrights conception of what he thought his function as a negro writer should be that is primarily responsible for his style ie his attitude towards his reader and his characters the negro world that wright wrote about was so strange so far from the lives of his white audience that wright indulged too often in the explanatory the negro characters that he created are usually so subhuman so dumb that for the most part wright was forced to stand in the pages of his fiction as a kind of negro spokesman in order for a work of fiction to mean anything it must first of all involve the reader for a black reader it is difficult to become involvedi mean really involved with wrights characters because he is always there intruding with his commentary explaining as it were what to a black reader needs no apologetic explanation this explanatory mood of wrights resulted finally in a dull dessicated prosaic sentence structure that leaves nothing to the readers imagination it is not as some critics have stated that wright doesnt have a sense of humor in his fiction it is simply that his prose style strangles his humor which like most elements of black culture has nuances that are difficult to grasp with discursive prose it is only after we have laid the story aside for some time and have allowed our minds to rearrange the images the setting the tone of wrights stories only after that methodical and plodding rhythm of his prose has ceased to reverberate in our minds that we appreciate his humour one of the reasons incidentally that leroi jones is such a funny writer the alternative has to be one of the funniest stories ever written in america is that his style is essentially poetic and this is why too in tales he can convey so much of negro life poetry rather than prose seems to be the tool that is best for conveying the subtleties the nuances the complexity of negro culture wrights style is about as close to poetry as say booker t washingtons or richard nixons with the exception of two stories man of all work and man god aint like that both of which were written in dialogue which was wrights forte the book eight men is the dullest i have ever read everywhere the reader turns in the book there is the dumb subhuman animallike nigger and his eloquent interpreter who possessing some smattering of sociological theories usually has the responsibility of forging the animals actions into some acceptable universal or literary theme take for instance the first few lines of the very first story the man who was almost a man dave struck out across the fields looking homeward through paling light whuts the use talkin wid em niggers in the field anyhow his mother was putting supper on the table them niggers cant understan nothing one of these days he was going to get a gun and practice shooting then they couldnt talk to him as though he were a little boy p id wrights negroes never think although wright will tell you they do this is left up to wrightas ellison said wright could imagine bigger but bigger could not possibly imagine richard wright wright saw to that the third is by the narrator ie wright but it is and this is importantonly an interpretation of what presumably the character is thinking the fourth which is dave speaking again is fused with the narrators interpretation and finally the fifth sentence although written in the language of the narrator is the thoughts of the boyor is it the narrator putting words into the boys mouth the problem is this we believe we know something about the boys mind but we cant be sure for after all it was reported to us by the narrator we can never really know the boy the narrator stands between us such that at the end of the story our feeling towards the boy are ambivalent and anxious this anxiety builds up to disastrous proportions if in the course of the story the protagonist is the victim of violence because one is forced to feel great sympathy for someone one does not know and does not know why maybe this is why upon finishing each of these stories i felt a bit frustrated and unsatisfied the long short story the man who lived underground collected in eight men suffers greatly from wrights dumb negroeloquent spokesman device the story cites he adventures of a negro murderer fred who lives in a manhole making robinson crusoetvpe discoveries fred is quite childish and when he finds a stack of money unlike crusoe with his mature sense of what monev can do in english societv fred is only intrigued with the form and color of ptl he steals a typewriter and radio upon which he literally sperds hours tinkering like a yearold but it is not of a child wright wants us to think his s imagining fred as a subhuman as some human who has become less human because he has been shut out of whte society and this is what ic behind wrights statement about tred never in fredsl life had he used a typewriterl it was a oueer instrument of business somethin beyond the rim of his life italics addedas though usig a typewriter is going to add something to the quality of ones life fone is reminded of course of te demoralized bigger thomas who wants to do things to fly airolanes like white boys a cryin shame yet this subhuman who has no humanity to speak of or at least one is not convinced of it is transformed into an intellectual before the story endsbecause wright has to give the thing a universal theme he selects the theme of orestes and the furies fred then marches out of his manhole into the police station and confesses he is guilty the police try to convince him that they had already caught the murderer of the woman whom fred claims he killed the story ends when fred finally persuades two policemen to go down into the underground to witness what he had experienced so that at last he would be free of his burden when they are deep in the tunnel one of the police shoots him with the explanation youve got to shoot his kind theyd wreck things wright not only ended up with the universal theme but he even achieved a bit of tearjerker what black writing has come to realize is that meaning ie theme is always implied in the image one has only to paint the metaphor of blacknessthe whole community despite its pretense to the contrary knows that the meaning is and again the history of black people in this country is within itself a universal themethe most universal of themes what universal theme means that is in wright is to write so white people can understandie without really understanding in the few stories in which wright left off the dscursive prose and let his character do their own explaining he created masterpieces in lawd today for example the dialogue gets as close to poetry as wright ever got in this novel the dialogue is fascinating because it is used to provoke the atmosphere the mood of black people that the most skilled prose writer would have difficulty in capturing the last fourth of the book is the best piece of writing wright accomplished the proof of this being in the fact that one can return to it and reread it again and again the novel depicts one day in the life of a postal clerk and in order to give the events his inevitable commentary wright has that day happen on february abraham lincolns birthday throughout the novel there are brief reminders of the civil war reminders that are so planted in the novel as to remind the reader that these negroes although wrapped in their own black culture are not free yet if this novel in its celebration of negro life could shake itself free of wrights commentary device it would rival native son as being wrights most valuable book ill i have been talking about technique and style and how they were influenced by wrights definition of the negro writer let me now deal with the treatment of theme which in wrights work was as subject to being dictated by white society as well as style let us take for example the theme of the white woman and her relationship with the black man there is only one kind of interaction between these two and that is one of unadulterated violence inflicted by the black male who is imaged as an animal this relationship is as rigid and codified as any element of medieval sym bolism the idea that a white woman is only a human being and one to whom it is possible to feel something other than hate is an idea that wrights blacks are incapable of this despite the fact that wrights own experience taught him otherwise when max is questioning bigger thomas about his alleged rape and murder of the white girl mary dalton he suggests that bigger might have liked mary biggers reaction is depicted as that of an animals did you like her max asked like her biggers voice boomed so suddenly from his throat that max started bigger leaped to his feet his eyes widened and his hands lifted midway to face trembling italics added no no bigger max said p thus bigger the prototype nigger in his attitude towards the white woman is more of a creation of white society which is why white men like irving howe can so eagerly lay claim to him than he is of any black mans and so are those other black males in the pages of wrights fiction whose only response to white women is to chop off their heads concerning this baldwin has written in most of the novels by negroes until today there is a great space where sex ought to be and what usually fills this space is violence this violence as in so much of wrights work is gratuitoils and compulsive it is one of the severest criticisms that can be leveled against his work the violence is never examined i do not believe that wright did not examine that violence if it existed in his personal life what seems to be the case is that wright subscribed to a literary convention that had as much to do with life as say menthol cigarettes a convention responsible only to white society one could k for example at the treatment of the theme of the white woman in an autobiographical story called the man who went to chicago in which the hero is an intelligent young man whom we must recognize as none other than the author and his attitude towards white women is simply normal it is only when wright had to create fictional characters that he insisted on gratuitous violence iv native son bigger thomas like othello another victim of white society is dumb but whereas othellos error lies in othello in his perception biggers lies in bad style in richard wright biggers dumbness is only a thematic device wright is not so much interested in the character of bigger as he is in using whatever literary conventions to make an ideological point thus at the beginning of the novel it is convenient to have bigger extremely stupid for purposes of motivation and after the murder again it is convenient to give bigger some awareness of his crime thus adding to the significance of the crime as a theme so that on page bigger is so stupid that he doesnt know what a communist is when his friend helps him with a communist is a red he dumbly asks whats a red yet on page he is suddenly ruminating on world issues of late he had liked to hear tell of men who could rule others for in actions such as these he felt that here was an escape from his tight morass of fear and shame that sapped at the base of his life he liked to hear of how japan was conquering china of how hitler was running the jews to the ground of how mussolini was invading spain one ceases to believe in bigger as a character and there are moments when the reader grasps at biggers action and the ideas behind them with the same awe and lack of understanding that his own family did and this happens because one feels he does not know bigger which is because he doesnt exist as a human being a rebel without a brain biggers tragedy is a personal one and it exists in the fact that he simply refuses to cannot see wrights tragedy is that he fails to condemn this blindness though it may be that biggers demoralization is wrights ie wright as artist bigger for instance prides himself on the knowledge that no one would ever think that a black timid negro like himself was responsible or is this wright putting words in his mouth for he felt that they white people ruled him even when they were far away and not thinking of him ruled him by conditioning him in his relations to his own people p bigger is only embodying a fantasy white society created for him long ago and this is why he feels that the murder is an act of creation he talks about the murder bringing out the hidden meaning of his life this has to be taken ironically because what is really meant is that bigger a kind of racial correlative objective was created to serve white society biggei wanted to be white but he wasnt smart enough to see that what can be had in whiteness can most certainly be had in blackness why couldnt wright see this v criticsblack and white the distance between bigger thomas and richard wright even after the publication of black boy was so notoriously great that ellison in his famous essay richard wrights blues set out to explain it by discussing some of its cultural sources i hope to answer those critics who would make of the book a miracle and of its author a mystery one of those cultural sources ellison took to be the blues and so began his essay a much quoted paragraph on the function of the blues after this insightful opening ellison dwindles into some wellstated sociology about the southern rural family and has nothing else to say about the blues except in the last paragraph despite its title and general ini tent ellisons essay in retrospect sheds much doubt on whether wright ever really understood the blues in another essay a rejoinder published years later ellison disparages wrights knowledge of blues and says hemingway was more important to me than wright not because he was white or more accepted but because he appreciated the things of this earth which i love and which wright was too driven or deprived or inexperienced to know hemingways love for life ellison says in couiiterdistinction was very close to the feeling of the blues in terms of explaining wright i think ellison was much closer when he said recently that wright was as much a product of his reading as of his painful experiences and he made himself a writer by subjecting himself to the writers disciplineas he understood it this changing critical attitude of ellisons toward wright i cite as an example of how critical theory has changed in the last years it is interesting too that during the writing of his essay ellisons criticism was about as equally imbued with sociological theories as was wrights writing baldwins criticism of the protest novel everybodys protest novel in general and his essay alas poor richard in particular is very good critically on wright and precisely because baldwin stayed clear of theorieswell at least sociological ones irving howe is typical of the white critics who harbor a vested interest in richard wrights negroes in his now famous essay black boys and native sons howe claims his disagreement with ellison and baldwin has something to do with protest but howes real objection is that these writers unlike wright refuse to create demoralized unintelligible subhumans whose sole lifetime concern is consumed in hating the invincible force as howe lkes to imagine it of the white world rather these writers have given us humane courageous profound aware conscious heroes who are reallv more j concerned with themselves and their own realities than with those of white jewish intellectuals lke howe whom wright apparently was so respectful of howe accuses baldwin and ellison of not protesting but what he refuses to acknowledge is that baldwin and ellison for all their faults by virtue of their existence as excellent moral craftsmen are protesting their protest is positive protest because in addition to blasting the white world ie not letting white people get to them they erect black positive images richard wright begged baldwin ellison leroi jones eldridge cleaver are not begging and this upsets the howetypes because they need to hear the rasping rage of groveling demoralized bigger thomases at the door of white society in order to be assured themselves that white society still exists as the only possible alternative for the negro personality howe writes for example that in native son wright struggles to transcend violence that he did not fully succeed seems obvious one may doubt that any negro writer could now this cracker must be kidding because almost every black writer i know of has transcended violence at least that violence of biggers howe like wright believes that violence is the negro writers lot not to write about violence is to avoid writing about negro life this is why he finds giovannis room a flat failure because it abandons negro life entirely finally howe assigns wright as spiritual father to both ellison and baldwin ellison because he didnt come around to protest is suffering as a result but baldwin has come around baldwins most recent novel another country is a protest novel quite as much as native son no longer is baldwins prose so elegant or suave as it once was in this book it is harsh clumsy heavybreathng wth the pant of suppressed bitterness obviously this white man is speaking of negative protest demoralized protest and not the protest of james brown or leroi jones in other words positive protest that asserts its own beauty if you will its own elegance as it protests is not viable well howe and his buddies had better wake up or not wake up as they wish in that limited and almost barren field known as the negro novel arna bontemps black thunder fills a yawning gap and fills it competently covering all those skimpy reaches of negro letters i know this is the only novel dealing forthrightly with the historical and revolutionary traditions of the negro people black thunder is the true story of a slave insurrection that failed but in his telling of the story of that failure bontemps manages to reveal and dramatize through the character of his protagonist gabriel a quality of folk courage unparalleled in the proletarian literature of this country gabriel is a young slave who hearing of the struggles of the french proletariat and the exploits of louverture decides to avenge the murder of a fellowslave by leading the negroes of richmond virginia against the landowners on the night when the attack is to take place gabriels ragged slavehost armed with cutlasses pikes and a peck of bullets hides in the woods near richmond waiting for the call to advance and capture the arsenal at the crucal moment a terrific rainstorm sweeps down flooding the fields and bogging the roads this coupled with the treachery of two members of his band makes the uprising impossible gabriels army deserts him the next three weeks are times of wild terror for everywhere the white plantation owners are asking one another what negro can you point to and say definitely he is not involved from that juncture onward black thunder is mainly the story of gabriel who believes in the eventual triumph of his destiny in spite of all the forces which conspire against it he is convinced that god and the universe are on his side he believes he must and will lead the negro people to freedom he seems to have no personal fear and no personal courage he thinks dreams and feels wholly in terms of negro liberation his mind is a confused mixture of superstition naive cunning idealism and a high courage born partly of his deep ignorance and partly of an amazing ability to forget his personal safety he contemptuously refuses to run to the mountains to save himself and decides to stay near the scene of the insurrection to get in twothree mo good licks fo my time comes when considering gabriel solely as an isolated individual he seems sustained by an extremely foolish belief in himself but when one remembers his slave state when one realizes the extent to which he has made the wrongs of his people his wrongs and the degree in which he has submerged his hopes in their hopeswhen one remembers this he appears logically and gloriously invincible the plan for the uprising is so simple and daring that when it is disclosed and tracked to its source the fearridden whites can scarcely believe it but gabriel believes he believes even when he is caught even when the black cowl is capped about his head even when the ax swings he believes why for me the cardinal value of bontemps book besides the fact that it is a thumping story well told lies in the answer to that question perhaps i am straying further afield than the author did in search for an answer if i do it is because i believe we have in black thunder a revelation of the very origin and source of folk values in literature even though gabriels character is revealed in terms of personal action and dialogue i feel there is in him much more than mere personal dignity and personal courage there is in his attitude something which transcends the limits of immediate consciousness he is buoyed in his hope and courage by an optimism which takes no account of the appalling difficulties confronting him he hopes when there are no objective reasons or grounds for hope he fights when his fellowslaves scamper for their lives in doing so he takes his place in that gallery of fictitious characters who exist on the plane of the ridiculous and the sublime bontemps endows gabriel with a myth and deathless quality and it is in this sense i believe that black thunder sounds a new note in negro fiction thereby definitely extending the boundaries and ideology of the negro novel she stood with her black face some six inches from the moist windowpane and wondered when on earth would it ever stop raining it might keep up like this all week she thought she heard rain droning upon the roof and high up in the wet sky her eyes followed the silent rush of a bright shaft of yellow that swung from the airplane beacon in far off memphis momently she could see it cutting through the rainy dark it would hover a second like a gleaming sword above her head then vanish she sighed troubling johnnyboys been trampin in this slop all day wid no decent shoes on his feet through the window she could see the rich black earth sprawling outside in the night there was more rain than the clav could soak up pools stood everywhere she yawned and mumbled rains good n bad it kin make seeds bus up thu the groun er it kin bog things down lika watahsoaked coffin her hands were folded loosely over her stomach and the hot air of the kitchen traced a filmy veil of sweat on her forehead from the cook stove came the soft singing of burning wood and now and then a throaty bubble rose from a pot of simmering greens shucks johnnyboy coulda let somebody else do all tha runnin in the rain theres others bettah fixed fer it than he is but naw johnnyboy ain the one t trust nobody t do nothin hes gotta do it all hissef she glanced at a pile of damp clothes in a zinc tub waal ah bettah git t work she turned lifted a smoothing iron with a thick pad of cloth touched a spitwet finger to it with a quick jerking motion smiiiitz yeah its hot stooping she took a blue workshirt from the tub and shook it out with a deft twist of her shoulder she caught the iron in her right hand the fingers of her left hand took a piece of wax from a tin box and a frying sizzle came as she smeared the bottom she was thinking of nothing now her hands followed a lifelong ritual of toil spreading a sleeve she ran the hot iron to and fro until the wet cloth became stiff she was deep in the midst of her work when a song rose up out of the far off days of her childhood and broke through halfparted lips hes the lily of the valley the bright n mawnin star hes the fairest of ten thousan t mah soul a gust of wind dashed rain against the window johnnyboy oughta c mon home n eat his suppah aw lawd ltd be fine ef sug could eat wid us tonight ltd be like ol times mabbe aftah all it wont be long for he comes back tha lettah ah got from im las week said don give up hop yeah we gotta live in hope then both of her sons sug and johnnyboy would be back with her with an involuntary nervous gesture she stopped and stood still listening but the only sound was the lulling fall of rain shucks ain no usa me ackin this way she thought ever time they gits ready to hoi them meetings ah gits jumpity ah been a lil scared ever since sug went t jail she heard the clock ticking and looked johnnyboys a hour late he sho mus be havin a time doin all that trampin trampin thu the mud but her fear was a quiet one it was more like an intense brooding than a fear it was a sort of hugging of hated facts so closely that she could feel their grain like letting cold water run over her hand from a faucet on a winter morning she ironed again faster now as if she felt the more she engaged her body in work the less she would think but how could she forget johnnyboy out there on those wet fields rounding up white and black communists for a meeting tomorrow and that was just what sug had been doing when the sheriff had caught him beat him and tried to make him tell who and where his comrades were po sug they sho musta beat the boy somethin awful but thank gawd he didnt talk he ain no weaklin sug ain hes been lionhearted all his life long that had happened a year ago and now each time those meetings came around the old terror surged back while shoving the iron a cluster of toiling days returned days of washing and ironing to feed johnnyboy and sug so they could do party work days of carrying a hundred pounds of white folks clothes upon her head across fields sometimes wet and sometimes dry but in those days a hundred pounds was nothing to carry carefully balanced upon her head while stepping by instinct over the corn and cotton rows the only time it had seemed heavy was when she had heard of sugs arrest she had been coming home one morning with a bundle upon her head her hands swinging idly by her sides walking slowly with her eyes in front of her when bob johnnyboys pal had called from across the fields and had come and told her that the sheriff had got sug that morning the bundle had become heavier than she could ever remember and with each passing week now though she spoke of it to no one things were becoming heavier the tubs of water and the smoothing iron and the bundle of clothes were becoming harder to lift with her back aching so and her work was taking longer all because sug was gone and she didnt know just when johnnyboy would be taken too to ease the ache of anxiety that was swelling her heart she hummed then sang softly he walks wid me he talks wid me he tells me ahm his own guiltily she stopped and smiled looks like ah jus cant seem t fergit them ol songs no mattah how hard ah tries she had learned them when she was a little girl living and working on a farm every monday morning from the corn and cotton fields the slow strains had floated from her mothers lips lonely and haunting and later as the years had filled with gall she had learned their deep meaning long hours of scrubbing floors for a few cents a day had taught her who jesus was what a great boon it was to cling to him to be like him and suffer without a mumbling word she had poured the yearning of her life into the songs feeling buoyed with a faith beyond this world the figure of the man nailed in agony to the cross his burial in a cold grave his transfigured resurrection his being breath and clay god and manall had focused her feelings upon an imagery which had swept her life into a wondrous vision but as she had grown older a cold white mountain the white folks and their laws had swum into her vision and shattered her songs and their spell of peace to her that white mountain was temptation something to lure her from her lord a part of the world god had made in order that she might endure it and come through all the stronger just as christ had risen with greater glory from the tomb the days crowded with trouble had enhanced her faith and she had grown to love hardship with a bitter pride she had obeyed the laws of the white folks with a soft smile of secret knowing after her mother had been snatched up to heaven in a chariot of fire the years had brought her a rough working man and two black babies sug and johnnyboy all three of whom she had wrapped in the charm and magic of her vision then she was tested by no less than god her man died a trial which she bore with the strength shed by the grace of her vision finally even the memory of her man faded into the vision itself leaving her with two black boys growing tall slowly into manhood then one day grief had come to her heart when johnnyboy and sug had walked forth demanding their lives she had sought to fill their eyes with her vision but they would have none of it and she had wept when they began to boast of the strength shed by a new and terrible vision but she had loved them even as she loved them now bleeding her heart had followed them she could have done no less being an old woman in a strange world and day by day her sons had ripped from her startled eyes her old vision and image by image had given her a new one different but great and strong enough to fling her into the light of another grace the wrongs and sufferings of black men had taken the place of him nailed to the cross the meager beginnings of the party had become another resurrection and the hate of those who would destroy her new faith had quickened in her a hunger to feel how deeply her new strength went lawd johnnyboy she would sometimes say ah jus wan them white folks t try t make me tell who is in the party n who ainl ah jus wan em t try n ahll show em somethin they never thought a black woman could have but sometimes like tonight while lost in the forgetfulness of work the past and the present would become mixed in her while toiling under a strange star for a new freedom the old songs would slip from her lips with their beguiling sweetnessthe iron was getting cold she put more wood into the fire stood again at the window and watched the yellow blade of light cut through the wet darkness johnnyboy ain here yit then before she was aware of it she was still listening for sounds under the drone of rain she heard the slosh of feet in mud tha ain johnnyboy she knew his long heavy footsteps in a million she heard feet come on the porch some woman she heard bare knuckles knock three times then once thas some of them comrades she unbarred the door cracked it a few inches and flinched from the cold rush of damp wind whos tha its me who me reva she flung the door open lawd chile c mon in she stepped to one side and a thin blondhaired white girl ran through the door as she slid the bolt she heard the girl gasping and shaking her wet clothes somethings wrong reva wouldna walked a mile t mah house in

ironing board her hands as usual folded loosely over her stomach watchin reva pull off her waterclogged shoes she was feeling that johnnyboy was already lost to her she was feeling the pain that would come when she knew it for certain and she was feeling that she would have to be brave and bear it she was like a person caught in a swift current of water and knew where the water was sweeping her and did not want to go on but had to go on to the end it ain nothin bout johnnyboy an sue said reva but we gotta do somethin er well all git inter trouble how the sheriff know about the meetin thas whut

eyes po critter gotta go back thu all tha slop though she felt sorry for reva not once did she think that it would not have to be done being a woman reva was not suspect she would have to go it wis just as natural for reva to go back through the cold rain as it was for her to iron night and day or for sug to be in jail right now johnnyboy was out there on those dark fields trying to get home lawd don let em git im tonight in spite of herself her feelings became torn she loved her son and loving him she loved what he was trying to do johnnyboy was happiest when he was working for the party and her love for him was for his happiness she frowned trying hard to fit something together in her feelings for her to try to stop johnnyboy was to admit that all the toil of years meant nothing and to let him go meant that sometime or other he would be caught like sug in facing it this way she felt a little stunned as though she had come suddenly upon a blank wall in the dark but outside in the rain were people white and black whom she had known all her life those people depended upon johnnyboy loved him and looked to him as a man and leader yeah hes gotta keep on he cant stop now she looked at reva she was crying and pulling her shoes back on with reluctant fingers whut you carryin on tha way fer chile yuh done los sug now yuh sending johnnyboy a got t honey she was glad she could say that reva believed in black folks and not for anything in the world would she falter before her in revas trust and acceptance of her she had found her first feelings of humanity revas love was her refuge from shame and degradation if in early days of her life the white mountain had driven her back from the earth then in her last days revas love was drawing her toward it like the beacon that swung through the night outside she heard reva sobbing hush honey mah brothers in jail too ma cries ever day ah know honey she helped reva with her coat her fingers felt the scant flesh of the girls shoulders she don git ernuff t eat she thought she slipped her arms around revas waist and held her close for a moment now yuh stop that cryin aaah cccant hep it everythingll be awright johnnyboyll be back yuh think so sho chile cos he will neither of them spoke again until they stood in the doorway outside they could hear water washing through the ruts of the street be sho n send johnnyboy t tell the folks t stay erway from pas house said reva ahll tell im don yuh worry goodbye goodbye leaning against the door jamb she shook her head slowly and watched reva vanish through the falling rain ii she was back at her board ironing when she heard feet sucking in the mud of the back yard feet she knew from long years of listening were johnnyboys but tonight with all the rain and fear his coming was like a leaving was almost more than she could bear tears welled to her eyes and she blinked them away she felt that he was coming so that she could give him up to see him now was to say goodbye but it was a goodbye she knew she could never say they were not that way toward each other all day long they could sit in the same room and not speak she was his mother and he was her son most of the time a nod or a grunt would carry all the meaning that she wanted to convey to him or he to her she did not even turn her head when she heard him come stomping into the kitchen she heard him pull up a chair sit sigh and draw off his muddy shoes they fell to the floor with heavy thuds soon the kitchen was full of the scent of his drying socks and his burning pipe tha boys hongry she paused and looked at him over her shoulder he was puffing at his pipe with his head tilted back and his feet propped up on the edge of the stove his eyelids drooped and his wet clothes steamed from the heat of the fire lawd tha boy gits mo like his pa ever day he lives she mused her lips breaking in a slow faint smile hols tha pipe in his mouth just like his pa usta hoi his wondah how they woulda got erlong ef his pa had lived they oughta liked each other they so mucha like she wished there could have been other children besides sug so johnnyboy would not have to be so much alone a man needs a woman by his side she thought of reva she liked reva the brightest glow her heart had ever known was when she had learned that reva loved johnnyboy but beyond reva were cold white faces ef theys caught it means death she jerked around when she heard johnnyboys pipe clatter to the floor she saw him pick it up smile sheepishly at her and wag his head gawd ahm sleepy he mumbled she got a pillow from her room and gave it to him here she said hunh he said putting the pillow between his head and the back of the chair they were silent again yes she would have to tell him to go back out into the cold rain and slop maybe to get caught maybe for the last time she didnt know but she would let him eat and get dry before telling him that the sheriff knew of the meeting to be held at lems tomorrow and she would make him take a big dose of soda before he went out soda always helped to stave off a cold she looked at the clock it was eleven theres time yit spreading a newspaper on the apron of the stove she placed a heaping plate of greens upon it a knife a fork a cup of coffee a slab of cornbread and a dash of peach cobbler yo suppahs ready she said yeah he said he did not move she ironed again presently she heard him eating when she could no longer hear his knife tinkling against the edge of the plate she knew he was through it was almost twelve now she would let him rest a little while longer before she told him till one erclock mabbe hes so tired she finished her ironing put away the board and stacked the clothes in her dresser drawer she poured herself a cup of black coffee drew up a chair sat down and drank yuh almos dry she said not looking around yeah he said turning sharply to her the tone of voice in which she had spoken had let him know that more was coming she drained her cup and waited a moment longer reva wuz here yeah she lef bout a hour ergo whut she say she said ol man lem hada visit from the sheriff today bout the meetin yeah she saw him stare at the coals glowing red through the crevices of the stove and run his fingers nervously through his hair she knew he was wondering how the sheriff had found out in the silence he would ask a wordless question and in the silence she would answer wordlessly johnnyboys too trustin she thought hes trying t make the party big n hes takin in folks fastern he kin git t know em you cant trust ever white man yuh meet yuh know johnnyboy yuh been taking in a lotta them white folks lately aw ma but johnnyboy please don talk t me bout tha now ma yuh aint t ol t lissen n learn son she said ah know whut yuh gonna say ma n yuh wrong yuh cant judge folks jus by how yuh feel bout em n by how long yuh done knowed em ef we start tha we wouldnt have nobody in the party when folks pledge they word t be with us then we gotta take em in wes too weak t be choosy he rose abruptly rammed his hands into his pockets and stood facing the window she looked at his back in a long silence she knew his faith it was deep he had always said that black men could not fight the rich bosses alone a man could not fight with every hand against him but he believes so hard hes blind she thought at odd times they had had these arguments before always she would be pitting her feelings against the hard necessity of his thinking and always she would lose she shook her head po johnnyboy he don know but ain nona our folks tol johnnyboy she said how yuh know he asked his voice came low and with a tinge of anger he still faced the window and now and then the yellow blade of light flicked across the sharp outline of his black face cause ah know em she said anybody mighta tol he said it wuznt nona our folks she said again she saw his hand sweep in a swift arc of disgust our folks ma who in gawds name is our folks the folks we

mo minutes now n hell be gone like sug mabbe her throat tightened this black mans fight takes everthin look like gawd put us in this world jus t beat us down keep this ma he said she saw a crumpled

drink this glass of soda watah she watched him drink then put the glass away waal he said take the stuff outta yo pockets she lifted the lid of the stove and he dumped all the papers from his pocket into the fire she followed him to the door and made him turn round lawd yuh tryin to maka revolution n yuh cant even keep yo coat buttoned her nimble fingers fastened his collar high around his throat there he pulled the brim of his hat low over his eyes she opened the door and with the suddenness of the cold gust of wind that struck her face he was gone she watched the black fields and the rain take him her eyes burning when the last faint footstep could no longer be heard she closed the door went to her bed lay down and pulled the cover over her while fully dressed her feelings coursed with the rhythm of the rain hes gone lawd ah know hes gone her blood felt cold she was floating in a grey void somewhere between sleeping and dreaming and then suddenly she was wide awake hearing and feeling in the same instant the thunder of the door crashing in and a cold wind filling the room it was pitch black and she stared resting on her elbows her mouth open not breathing her ears full of the sound of tramping feet and booming voices she knew at once they lookin fer im then filled with her will she was on her feet rigid waiting listening the lamps burnin yuh see her naw look in the kitchen gee this place smells like niggers say somebodys here er been here yeah theres fire in the stove mabbe hes been here n gone boy look at these jars of jam niggers make good jam git some bread

veins bulged the kitchen was crowded with white men in glistening raincoats though the lamp burned their flashlights still glowed in red fists across her floor she saw the muddy tracks of their boots yuh white folks git outta mah house there was quick silence every face turned toward her she saw a sudden movement but did not know what it meant until something hot and wet slammed her squarely in the face she gasped but did not move calmly she wiped the warm greasy liquor of greens from her eyes with her left hand one of the white men had thrown a handful of greens out of the pot at her how they taste ol bitch ah ast yuh t git outta mah house she saw the sheriff detach himself from the crowd and walk toward her now anty white man don yuh anty me yuh ain got the right sperit sperit hell

of yo kind that wuznt too low fer he slapped her again she reeled backward several feet and fell on her side is tha whut we too low t do she stood before him again dryeyed as though she had not been

kill im he wont be the only nigger yuh ever killed she said she was consumed with a bitter pride there was nothing on this earth she felt then that they could not do to her but that she could take she stood on a narrow plot of ground from which she would die before she was pushed and then it was while standing there feeling warm blood seeping down her throat that she gave up johnnyboy gave him up to the white folks she gave him up because they had come tramping into her heart demanding him thinking they could get him by beating her thinking they could scare her into making her tell where he was she gave him up because she wanted them to know that they could not get what they wanted by bluffing and killing wheres this meetin gonna be the sheriff asked don yuh wish yuh knowed ain there

followed yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted she thought exultingly n yuh ain gonna never git it hotly something ached in her to make them feel the intensity of her pride and freedom her heart groped to turn the bitter hours of her life into words of a kind that would make them feel that she had taken all they had done to her in her stride and could still take more her faith surged so strongly in her she was all but blinded she walked behind them to the door knotting and twisting her fingers she saw them step to the muddy ground each whirl of the yellow beacon revealed glimpses of slanting rain her lips moved then she shouted yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted n yuh ain gonna nevah git it the sheriff stopped and turned his voice came low and hard now by gawd thas ernuff outta yuh ah know when ah done said ernuff aw naw yuh don he said yuh don know when yuh done said ernuff but ahma teach yuh ternight he was up the steps and across the porch with one bound she backed into the hall her eyes full on his face tell me when yuh gonna stop talkin he said swinging his fist the blow caught her high on the cheek her eyes went blank she fell flat on her face she felt the hard heel of his wet shoes coming into her temple and stomach lemme hear yuh talk some mo she wanted to but could not pain numbed and choked her she lay still and somewhere out of the grey void of unconsciousness she heard someone say aw fer chrissakes leave her erlone its the nigger we wan she never knew how long she had lain huddled in the dark hallway her first returning feeling was of a nameless fear crowding the inside of her then a deep pain spreading from her temple downward over her body her ears were filled with the drone of rain and she shuddered from the cold wind blowing through the door she opened her eyes and at first saw nothing as if she were imagining it she knew she was halflying and halfsitting in a corner against a wall with difficulty she twisted her neck and what she saw made her hold her breatha vast white blur was suspended directly above her for a moment she could not tell if her fear was from the blur or if the blur was from her fear gradually the blur resolved itself into a huge white face that slowly filled her vision she was stone still conscious really of the effort to breathe feeling somehow that she existed only by the mercy of that white face she had seen it before its fear had gripped her many times it had for her the fear of all the white faces she had ever seen in her life sue as from a great distance she heard her name being called she was regaining consciousness now but the fear was coming with her she looked into the face of a white man wanting to scream out for him to go yet accepting his presence because she felt she had to though some remote part of her mind was active her limbs were powerless it was as if an invisible knife had split her in two leaving one half of her lying there helpless while the other half shrank in dread from a forgotten but familiar enemy sue its me sue its me then all at once the voice came clearly sue its me its booker and she heard an answering voice speaking inside of her yeah its booker the one wuht jus joined she roused herself struggling for full consciousness and as she did so she transferred to the person of booker the nameless fear she felt it seemed that booker towered above her as a challenge to her right to exist upon the earth yuh awright she did not answer she started violently to her feet and fell sue yuh hurt yeah she breathed where they hit yuh its mah head she whispered she was speaking even though she did not want to the fear that had hold of her compelled her they beat yuh yeah them bastards them gawddam bastards she heard him saying it over and over then she felt herself being lifted naw she gasped ahma take yuh t the kitchen put me down but yuh cant stay here like this she shrank in his arms and pushed her hands against his body when she was in the kitchen she freed herself sank into a chair and held tightly to its back she looked wonderingly at booker there was nothing about him that should frighten her so but even that did not ease her tension she saw him go to the water bucket wet his handkerchief wring it and offer it to her distrustfully she stared at the damp cloth here put this on yo fohead naw cmon itll make yuh feel bettah she hesitated in confusion what right had she to be afraid when someone was acting as kindly as this toward her reluctantly she leaned forward and pressed the damp cloth to her head it helped with each passing minute she was catching hold of herself yet wondering why she felt as she did whut happened ah don now yuh feel bettah yeah who all wuz here ah don know she said again yo head still hurt yeah gee ahm sorry ahm awright she sighed and buried her face in her hands she felt him touch her shoulder sue ah got some bad news fer yuh she knew she stiffened and grew cold it had happened she stared dryeyed with compressed lips its mah johnnyboy she said yeah ahm awful sorry t hafta tell yuh this way but ah thought yuh oughta know her tension eased and a vacant place opened up inside of her a voice whispered jesus help me wwwhere is he they got im out t foleys woods trying t make im tell who the others is he ain gonna tell she said they just as waal kill im cause he ain gonna tell ah hope he don said booker but he didnt hava chance t tell the others they grabbed im just as he got t the woods then all the horror of it flashed upon her she saw flung out over the rainy countryside an array of shacks where white and black comrades were sleeping in the morning they would be rising and going to lems then they would be caught and that meant terror prison and death the comrades would have to be told she would have to tell them she could not entrust johhnyboys work to another and especially not to booker as long as she felt toward him as she did gripping the bottom of the chair with both hands she tried to rise the room blurred and she swayed she found herself resting in bookers arms lemme go sue yuh too weak t walk ah gotta tell em she said set down sue yuh hurt yuh sick when seated she looked at him helplessly sue listen johnnyboys caught ahm here yuh tell me who they is n ahll tell em she stared at the floor and did not answer yes she was too weak to go there was no way for her to tramp all those miles through the rain tonight but should she tell booker if only she had somebody like reva to talk to she did not want to decide alone she must make no mistake about this she felt bookers fingers pressing on her arm and it was as though the white mountain was pushing her to the edge of a sheer height she again exclaimed inwardly jesus hep me bookers white face was at her side waiting would she be doing right to tell him suppose she did not tell and then the comrades were caught she could not ever forgive herself for doing a thing like that but maybe she was wrong maybe her fear was what johnnyboy had always called jus foolishness she remembered his saying ma we cant make the party grow ef we start doubtin everbody tell me who they is sue n ahll tell em ah jus joined n ah don know who they is ah don know who they is she said yuh gotta tell me who they is sue ah tol yuh ah don know yuh do know c mon set up n talk naw yuh wan em all t git killed she shook her head and swallowed lawd ah don blieve in this man lissen ahll call the names n yuh tell me which ones is in the party n which ones ain see naw please sue ah don know she said sue yuh ain doin right by em johnnyboy wouldnt wan yuh t be this way hes out there holdin up his end les hoi up ours lawd ah don know is yuh scareda me cause ahm white johnnyboy ain like tha don let all the work we done go fer

gotta tell me sue mistah booker please leave me erlone is it murphy she answered yes to the names of johnnyboys comrades she answered until he asked her no more then she thought how he know the sheriffs men is watchin lems house she stood up and held onto her chair feeling something sure and firm within her how yuh know bout lem why how ah know whut yuh doin here this tima night how yuh know the sheriff got johnnyboy sue don yuh believe in me she did not but she could not answer she stared at him until her lips hung open she was searching deep within herself for certainty you meet reva she asked reva yeah lems gal oh yeah sho ah met reva she tell yuh she asked the question more of herself than of him she longed to believe yeah he said softly ah reckon ah oughta be going t tell em now who she asked tell whot the muscles of her body were stiff as she waited for his answer she felt as though life depended upon it the comrades he said yeah she sighed she did not know when he left she was not looking or listening she just suddenly saw the room empty and from her the thing that had made her fearful was gone v for a space of time that seemed to her as long as she had been upon the earth she sat huddled over the cold stove one minute she would say to herself they both gone now johnnyboy n sug maybe ahll never see em ergin then a surge of guilt would blot out her longing lawd ah shouldna tol she mumbled but no man kin be so lowdown as t do a think like tha several times she had an impulse to try to tell the comrades herself she was feeling a little better now but what good would that do she had told booker the names he jus couldnt be a judas t po folks like us he couldnt an sue thas reva her heart leaped with an anxious gladness she rose without answering and limped down the dark hallway through the open door against the background of rain she saw revas face lit now and then to whiteness by the whirling beams of the beacon she was about to call but a thought checked her jesus hep me ah gotta tell her bout johnnyboy lawd ah cant an sue yuh there c mon in chile she caught reva and held her close for a moment without speaking lawd ahm sho glad yuh here she

just a little while she would tell reva she felt the girls finger pressing gently upon her head tha hurt a chile yuh po thing it ain nothin did johnnyboy come she hesitated yeah he done gone t tell the others revas voice sounded so clear and confident that it mocked her lawd ah cant tell this chile yuh tol im didnt yuh an sue yyyeah gee thas good ah tol pa he didnt hafta worry ef johnnyboy got

thas the way to be oh say ah fergot said reva measuring out spoonsful of coffee pa tol me t tell yuh t watch out fer that booker man hes a stool she showed not one sign of outward movement or expression but as the words fell from revas lips she went limp inside pa tol me soon as ah got back home he got word from town she stopped listening she felt as though she had been slapped to the extreme outer edge of life into a cold darkness she knew now what she had felt when she had looked up out of her fog of pain and had seen booker it was the image of all the white folks and the fear that went with them that she had seen and felt during her lifetime and again for the second time that night something she had felt had come true all she could say to herself was ah didnt like im gawd knows ah didnt ah tol johnnyboy it wuz some of them white folks here drink yo cawffee she took the cup her fingers trembled and the steaming liquid spilt onto her dress and leg ahm sorry an sue her

tired naw ahm awright an sue she heard the bottom of revas empty cup clank against the top of the stove ah got t make her go t bed yes booker would tell the names of the comrades to the sheriff if she could only stop him some way that was the answer the point the star that grew bright in the morning of new hope soon maybe half an hour from now booker would reach foleys woods hes boun t go the long

honey thas whut a mas fer t wait up fer her chullun good night an sue she watched reva pull up and leave the kitchen presently she heard the shucks in the mattress whispering and she knew that reva had gone to bed she was alone through the cracks of the stove she saw the fire dying to grey ashes the room was growing cold again the yellow beacon continued to flit past the window and the rain still drummed yes she was alone she had done this awful thing alone she must find some way out alone like touching a festering sore she put her fingers upon that moment when she had shouted her defiance to the sheriff when she had shouted to feel her strength she had lost sug to save others she had let johnnyboy go to save others and then in a moment of weakness that came from too much strength she had lost all if she had not shouted to the sheriff she would have been strong enough to have resisted booker she would have been able to tell the comrades herself something tightened in her as she remembered and understood the fit of fear she had felt on coming to herself in the dark hallway a part of her life she thought she had done away with forever had had hold of her then she had thought the soft warm past was over she had thought that it did not mean much when now she sang hes the lily of the valley the bright n mawnin star the days when she had sung that song were the days when she had not hoped for anything on this earth the days when the cold mountain had driven her into the arms of jesus she had thought that sug and johnnyboy had taught her to forget him to fix her hope upon the fight of black men for freedom through the gradual years she had believed and worked with them had felt strength shed from the grace of their terrible vision that grace had been upon her when she had let the sheriff slap her down it had been upon her when she had risen time and again from the floor and faced him but she had trapped herself with her own hunger to water the long dry thirst of her faith her pride had made a bargain which her flesh could not keep her having told the names of johnnyboys comrades was but an incident in a deeper horror she stood up and looked at the floor while call and countercall loyalty and counterloyalty struggled in her soul mired she was between two abandoned worlds living but dying without the strength of the grace that either gave the clearer she felt it the fuller did something well up from the depths of her for release the more urgent did she feel the need to fling into her black sky another star another hope one more terrible vision to give her strength to live and act softly and restlessly she walked about the kitchen feeling herself naked against the night the rain the world and shamed whenever the thought of revas love crossed her mind she lifted her empty hands and looked at her writhing fingers lawd whut kin ah do now she could still wade the creek and get to foleys woods before booker and then what how could she manage to see johnnyboy or booker again she heard the sheriffs threatening voice git yuh a sheet cause hes gonna be dead the sheet thas it the sheet her whole being leaped with will the long years of her life bent toward a moment of focus a point ah kin go wid mah sheet ahll be doin whut he said lawd gawd in heaven ahma go lika nigger woman wid mah windin sheet t git mah dead son but then what she stood straight and smiled grimly she had in her heart the whole meaning of her life her entire personality was poised on the brink of a total act ah know ah know she thought of johnny boys gun in the dresser drawer ahll hide the gun in the sheet n go aftah johnnyboys body she tiptoed to her room eased out the dresser drawer and got a sheet reva was sleeping the darkness was filled with her quiet breathing she groped in the drawer and found the gun she wound the gun in the sheet and held them both under her apron then she stole to the bedside and watched reva lawd hep her but mabbe shes bettah off this had t happen sometimes she n johnnyboy couldna been together in this here south n ah couldnt tell her bout booker itll come out awright n she wont evah know revas trust would never be shaken she caught her breath as the shucks in the mattress rustled dryly then all was quiet and she breathed easily again she tiptoed to the door down the hall and stood on the porch above her the yellow beacon whirled through the rain she went over muddy ground mounted a slope stopped and looked back at her house the lamp glowed in her window and the yellow beacon that swung every few seconds seemed to feed it with light she turned and started across the fields holding the gun and sheet tightly thinking po reva po critter shes fas ersleep vi for the most part she walked with her eyes half shut her lips tightly compressed leaning her body against the wind and the driving rain feeling the pistol in the sheet sagging cold and heavy in her fingers already she was getting wet it seemed that her feet found every puddle of water that stood between the corn rows she came to the edge of the creek and paused wondering at what point was it low taking the sheet from under her apron she wrapped the gun in it so that her fingers could be upon the trigger ahll cross here she thought at first she did not feel the water her feet were already wet but the water grew cold as it came up to her knees she gasped when it reached her waist lawd this creeks high when she had passed the middle she knew that she was out of danger she came out of the water climbed a grassy hill walked on turned a bend and saw the lights of autos gleaming ahead yeah theys still there she hurried with her head down wondah did ah beat im here lawd ah hope so a vivid image of bookers white face hovered a moment before her eyes and a surging will rose up in her so hard and strong that it vanished she was among the autos now from nearby came the hoarse voices of the men hey yuh she stopped nervously clutching the sheet

they led her toward the crowd in the woods her feelings were simple booker would not tell she was there with the gun to see to that the louder became the voices of the men the deeper became her feeling of wanting to right the mistake she had made of wanting to fight her way back to solid ground she would stall for time until booker showed up oh ef theyll only lemme git close t johnnyboy as

through the ghostly glare of the flashlights as the men formed a semicircle she saw johnnyboy lying in a trougn of mud he was tied with rope he lay hunched and one side of his face rested in a pool of black water his eyes were staring questioningly at her speak t im said the sheriff if she could only tell him why she was here but that was impossible she was close to what she wanted and she stared

crippled she heard the sheriff ask she did not answer she saw them roll the log up they lifted johnnyboy and laid him on his face and stomach then they pulled his legs over the log his kneecaps rested on the sheer top of the logs back and the toes of his shoes pointed groundward so absorbed was she in watching that she felt that it was she who was being lifted and made ready for torture git a crowbar said the sheriff a tall lank man got a crowbar from a nearby auto and stood over the log his jaws worked slowly on a wad of tobacco now its up t yuh anty the sheriff said tell the man whut t

she saw the sheriff stoop over johnnyboy place his flat palm over one ear and strike his fist against it with all his might he placed his palm over the other ear and struck again johnnyboy moaned his head rolling from side to side his eyes showing white amazement in a world without sound yuh wouldnt talk t im when yuh had the chance said the sheriff try n talk now she felt warm tears on her cheeks she longed to shoot johnnyboy and let him go but if she did that they would take the gun from her and booker would tell who the others were lawd hep me the men were talking loudly now as though the main business was over it seemed ages that she stood there watching johnnyboy roll and whimper in his world of silence say sheriff heres somebody lookin fer yuh who is it ah don know bring em in she stiffened and looked around wildly holding the gun tight is tha booker then she held still feeling that her excitement might betray her mabbe ah kin shoot em both mabbe ah kin shoot twicel the sheriff stood in front of her waiting the crowd parted and she saw booker hurrying forward ah know em all sheriff he called he came full into the muddy clearing where johnnyboy lay yuh mean yuh got the names sho the ol nigger she saw his lips hang open and silent when he saw her she stepped forward and raised the sheet whut she fired once then without pausing she turned hearing them yell she aimed at johnnyboy but they had their arms around her bearing her to the ground clawing at the sheet in her hand she glimpsed booker lying sprawled in the mud on his face his hands stretched out before him then a cluster of yelling men blotted him out she lay without struggling looking upward through the rain at the white faces above her and she was suddenly at peace they were not a white mountain now they were not pushing her any longer to the edge of life its awright she shot booker she hada gun in the sheet she shot im right thu the head whut she shoot im fer kill the bitch ah thought somethin

she turned her head toward johnnyboy he lay looking puzzled in a world beyond the reach of voices at leas he cant hear she thought c mon let im have it she listened to hear what johnnyboy could not they came two of them one right behind the other so close together that they sounded like one shot she did not look at johnnyboy now she looked at the white faces of the men hard and wet in the glare of the flashlights yuh hear tha nigger woman did tha surprise im hes in hell now wonderin whut hit im c mon give it t her sheiff lemme shoot her sheriff it wuz mah pal she shot awright pete thas fair ernuff she gave up as much of her life as she could before they took it from her but the sound of the shot and the streak of fire that tore its way through her chest forced her to live again intensely she had not moved save for the slight jarring impact of the bullet she felt the heat of her warm blood warming her cold wet back she yearned suddenly to talk yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted n yuh ain gonna nevah git it yuh didnt kill me ah come here by mahself she felt rain falling into her wideopen dimming eyes and heard faint voices her lips moved soundlessly yuh didnt git yuh didnt yuh didnt focused and pointed she was buried in the depths of her star swallowed in its peace and strength and not feeling her flesh growing cold cold as the rain that fell from the invisible sky upon the doomed living and the dead that never dies i am still inclined to see richard wright through the haze of popularfront nostalgia which i attach to many of the public phenomena of my nineteenthirties childhood i was only seven years old when native son was published in but it seems to me i can recall the warm reassurance with which it was received then by the middleclass jewish circles in brooklyn amidst which i was growing up i responded to the book in the same way when i finally read it in during the height of the civilrights eraanother kind of popularfront somewhat surprised to discover that its hero was a murderer i nevertheless felt that by the books end wright had more or less come back to making his peace with the family feeling against which bigger thomas had been defined that he was returning home to the liberalradical brotherhood of white and black after his fling at delinquency even while continuing to mutter sullen protests under his breath for this home was the one place i had assumed on the basis of wrights essay in the god that failed the only other work of his id read at the time that provided the atmosphere of human solidarity which enabled him to create and i supposed that it was nothing but the steadily growing corruption and relentless absolutism of the household that could have caused him to leave it as he eventually did my view was founded of course in a family pride that was extreme even though i myself had never been anything more radical than some kind of social democrat i think that if one goes deep enough one can find in the heart of every european marxist who was born a jew the notion that his jewishness somehow provides a paradigm for the condition of the proletariat so also is a similar conception of the lot of the negro probably to be found in the hearts of most american jewish intellectuals this is simply a revolutionaryage variant of the jews traditional presumption about himself being the elder brother to all men in suffering and in perceiving glimmers of the apocalypse at the brooklyn high school i attended in the late nineteenforties for example where the vast majority of the students were jewish and liberal there was a negro in the class ahead of me there were perhaps three or four negro students in the whole school who brilliant student that he was was lionized to such a degree that he almost became a public property we perceived him as if we were looking at ourselves in a dark mirror and he responded with a lifestyle that seemed to be an enhanced version of any of our own richard wright must have experienced something like this befriended surrounded advised and admonished by warmly admiring jewish artists and intellectuals from the moment he joined the communist party in to the t me he left it in bringing away with him the jewish wife he had found in its midst his life could easily have been viewed in the dark mirror by those jewish radicals who wished to do so born in the shtetl natchez mississippi in he emigrated to the american urban ghetto chicagos south c side in his voung manhood began his selfeducation as a writer and intellectual by reading such authors as h l mencken and received his higher education in the john reed club and the communist party it was according to wrights account in the god that failed a jewish writer named sol who first steered him to the chicago john reed club where he was introduced to a jewish boy who was to become one of the nations leading painters ben shahn according to wrights biographer constance webb to a chao who was to become one of the eminent composers of his day to a writer who was to create some of the best novels of his generation nelson algren again according to constance webb to a young jewish boy who was destined to film the nazi occupation of czechoslovakia the euphoria of fimes suc h as these could not have been easily forgotten and even in native son when wright is struggling to throw off the mantle of the communist brotherhood bigger thomas significantly achieves the only genuinely human relationshios with whites he has ever known through the friendship of two jewish communists the old lawyer max who tries to defend him against the death sentence and jan ehone modeled as constance webb tells us after a canadian jew named jan wittenber of whom wright had said that he alone erlone in the dialect of the southern negroes of wrights stories among the chicago comrades had shown a depth and richness of human understanding toward him that went beyond mere ideology wright responded loyally at first to the requirements of the brotherhood that had taken him in and given him his start as a writer and intellectual starting out as a poet he contributed to party journals such orthodox statements as this one published in the new masses in i am black and i have seen black hands raised in fists of revolt side by side with the white fists of white workers and some dayand it is only this which sustains me some day there shall be millions and millions of them on some red day in a burst of fists on a new horizon the image of the negro contained in this leftwhitmanesque vision is ultimately that of the supreme negro ideal of the epoch paul robeson singing the ballad for americans sleeves rolled up the black worker standing alongside the white worker fists clenched in anger at a common injustice as with many elements of the communist orthodoxy there was a thin and tortuous line that had to be walked in order to keep the purity of this vision intact the party strove to make the negro cause its ownultimately this was a european mythology trying to impose itself upon an american conditionand wright by the designated chief negro spokesman for the movements literary wing was assigned the delicate task of finding a black literary credo that would provide a more authentic voice for the negro masses than either the essentially bourgeoisassimilationist writings of the talented tenth had done prior to the first world war or the cutely folkloric works of the harlem school had achieved in the twenties but that would not veer over on the other hand into the excesses of negro nationalism such a credo was formulated in his essay blueprint for negro writing published in the fall issue of the partys shortlived negro literary journal new challenge which wright edited but it was one thing to theorize about such a negro literature and another thing entirely to practice it i have seen black hands may have satisfied the party hierarchy as an example of what to do but it could hardly suffice for a serious writer where was wright to find his own literary identity he evidently had his first intimation of an answer to this question in the fall of when he published an article in the new masses on joe louis knockout victory over max baer a jew incidentally for the world heavyweight championship in it the author of i have seen black hands commits the heresy of seeing for a moment the black fists alone entitled joe louis uncovers dynamite the article is entirely a description of the brief but violent outburst of rioting that took place in chicagos south side ghetto in the wake of louis victory for a fleeting instant it was black against white a confrontation founded in hostilities far deeper than those superficially contained in the question hurled at white passersby who yuh fer baer or louis a taxicab driver had his cab wrecked when he tried to put up a show of bravado in the face of this question storekeepers wright says gazed out their windows at the demonstrators in fear and with blanched faces inspired by louis example the rioters seemed to be saying we aint scared either well fight too when the time comes well win too wright does not hesitate to append his own enthusiasm to his description of the scene really he writes there was a religious feeling in the air well it wasnt exactly a religious feeling but it was something and you could feel it it was a feeling of unity of oneness and then later something had popped loose all right and it had come from deep down out of the darkness it had leaped from its coil and nobody could have said just what it was and nobody wanted to say blacks and whites were afraid but it was a sweet fear at least for the blacks it was a mingling of fear and fulfillment four centuries of oppression were rising to the surface the separatist implications of these remarks could not have struck communist sensibilities lightly and it is significant that the editors of the new masses saw fit to place at the head of the article a brief preface that sought to smooth over some of its ideological rough spots something of the same emotional release the editors granted occurs whenever a negro triumphs in competition with a white person but from this they moved on quickly to a reassertion of the orthodox view of the negros role in the revolution the communist party consisting of negroes as well as whites has made valiant beginningsthe scottsboro defense the demonstrations against italian fascism and in scores of other instances it was perhaps as a concession to this view that wright concluded his article by saying say comrade heres a wild river thats got to be harnessed and directed but the river released by this episode in wrights own spirit was not to be so easily harnessed his first major short story big boy leaves home published a few months after this article is a further inquiry into the nature of that dynamite uncovered by joe louis knockout blow it anticipates native son not only in the similarity of its protagonists name to that of bigger thomas but in the central act of the story big boys murder of a white man this act is committed in selfdefense just as biggers killing of the white girl is an accidental outcome of a defensive reflex but big boy like bigger after him implicitly accepts complete responsibility for it partly because he is a negro and the white society will accept no mitigating circumstances in his killing of a white person and partly because this inadvertent act has suddenly become something which defines him and enables him to transcend his old life situation at the end of the story big boy is riding in the back of a truck escaping to the north leaving behind him his past and all its limitations this individual course of transcendence and selfemancipation struck out upon in an ultimate gesture of opposition to the white man is the threatening heresy to the communist worldview that wright is about to pursue in his subsequent works of fiction but this is still only at its beginning point the story must have looked orthodox enough to any communist reader containing as it does so many welldrawn elements of the communist vision of the negro an impoverished southern setting a lynching scene and above all a depiction of spontaneous folksolidarity as big boys family and neighbors rally around to help him escape in a manner true to the marxian stress on objectivity wright has chosen a purely external narrative style for this story depicting only acts and circumstances and using pure dialogue through more than twothirds of its length the thoroughly unmarxist subjective focus of native son showing bigger thomas existential sense of mounting liberation and transcendence is entirely missing here this is also the case with his next two major stories which nevertheless continue to explore wrights preoccupation with a vision that centers in his fiction upon the murder of a white man by a negro in both stories the impact of this vision is softened by a pure rarely internalized narrative style and also by the thoroughly mitigating circumstances within which the murder is committed each time mann in down by the riversidesurely the noblest most robesonesque figure of a black man wright ever created has been trapped at home with his pregnant wife by a mississippi flood bringing her to a hospital in a boat borrowed from someone who has stolen it from a white man he encounters its enraged owner who begins shooting at him and whom he kills in selfdefense later after his wife has died and he has been mustered into doing rescue work he willingly saves the life of the daughter of the man he has killed upon their return to dry land she points him out as her fathers murderer and he is shot down by the mob silas in long black song who has been saving his meager earnings for years with the hope of obtaining complete ownership of his farm some day comes home one afternoon to discover that his wife has been raped by a white salesman when the salesman returns the next day silas kills him and then sending his wife and child away to safety he remains to shoot it out with the lynch mob that comes for him ultimately the house is burned to the ground with him inside it in all these three stories the killing at the pivotal point in the narrative is still susceptible of being viewed as the thoroughly provoked uprising of an enraged proletariat an act of solidarity with oppressed workers everywhere white or black when they were assembled and placed alongside fire and cloud the nearest thing to a communist propaganda tract in fiction that wright ever produced in the edition of uncle toms childrenwrights first bookthey did not seem out of place all four stories dealt with southern negroes and were therebv thematicallv connected fur thermore together they suggest that wright had not yet arrived at a firm resolution in his pursuit of the vision that had been disturbing him at least since the rioting over joe louis victory in the fall of for fire and cloud does seem seriously to offer the communist brotherhood as an alternative to some ultimate act of violence as a way for wright to depict a negro achieving full selfrealization in his relations with white men it is only in a fifth story bright and morning star written after the first edition of uncle toms children had gone to press but included in the edition of the book that wright shows clear signs of his coming definitive break with the communist alternative the story begins in a kind of communist euphoria showing a southern negro widow whose two sons have become active in the movement and whose satisfaction with the clandestine life of blackandwhite brotherhood that they have brought her is not diminished by the fact that one of them is in jail for his activities but this idyll is broken by a white informer who has made his way into the movement and into the widows confidence she discovers his identity only after she has given him a list of local party members and after her second son has been captured by a white mob while out trying to warn his comrades of the danger here wright uses a story that as he tells us in black boy he had heard and been profoundly impressed by as a boy in mississippi hiding a gun under a sheet the widow goes forth to where her son is being beaten to death by the mob telling them the sheet is for her sons burial when the informer arrivesshe has gotten there ahead of him by taking a shortcutshe shoots him before he can utter the names of her comrades in the party she is then killed by the mob along with her son for the first time in wrights stories the narrative becomes profoundly subjective in focus her whole being leaped with a will it says at the moment she decides upon her final course of action the long years of her life bent toward a moment of focus a point she had in her heart the whole meaning of her life her entire personality was poised on the brink of a total act this was the realization wright had been groping for all along here fully articulated for the first time and arrived at in a moment of betrayal if not by the communist movement at least by the widows blind faith in it significantly it seems to have been the negro leader benjamin dvis who alone among the party leadership spotted the heresy lurking within this story wright now felt that he knew clearly what he wanted and realized that in all his stories so far he had erred in the direction of sentimentahv when the reviews of uncle toms children began to appear he later wrote in an essay describing the genesis of native son i realized that i had made an awfully naive mistake i found that i had written a book which even bankers daughters could read and weep over and feel good about constance webb tells us that wright began feeling this way after he had received a letter from mrs franklin d roosevelt saying that the book was beautifully written and so vivid that i had a most unhappy time reading it and so now i swore to myself that if i ever wrote another book no one would weep over it that it would be so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears this time there would be no mitigating circumstancesat least not too many surrounding the outburst of black dynamite the result not of one or another immediate provocation but of those four centuries of oppression in a way how bigger was born published in pamphlet form shortly after the appearance of native son is more insistent than the novel is about a reversion to the primitive right of anger describing the various bigger thomass he had known wright often presents someone who goes beyond his novels protagonist in sheer toughness of skin such as this one discovered sitting in the white section of a jim crow streetcar in the south pride and the streetcar moved on its journey without incident this passage seems to be moving toward a vicariousness not unlike that of the boy who sends his big brother out after the block bully a few pages later angrily denouncing the white liberalism of such institutions as the south side boys club where he once worked wright tells how id say to myself go to it boys prove to the bastards that gave you these games that life is stronger than pingpong they did the police blotters of chicago are testimony to how much they did that was the only way i could contain myself for doing a job i hated for a moment id allow myself vicariously to feel as bigger feltnot much just a little just a littlebut still there it was there it was indeed wright was experiencing a prophetic vision of the black ghettos in revolt but what response to this was he seeing in himself ralph ellison has said that he found it disturbing that bigger thomas had none of the finer qualities of richard wright none of the imagination none of the sense of poetry none of the gaiety these were precisely the qualities that wright evidently wanted to strip away in his definitive examination of the meanings of a form of response that he seemed to have glimpsedand to have experienced only vicariously then and ever afterwardson that night in chicago in following joe louis victory over max baer and it was precisely his quality of imagination which enabled him to create an unimaginative character so unlike himself in order to enact this vicarious realization indeed in native son wright almost succeeds in achieving the imaginative liberation he sought by writing it the book eventually runs aground in the authors own intellectuality a quality which for the novels sake he had succeeded in suppressing both too well and not well enough the first twothirds of native son constitute one of the most exciting stretches of melodrama in american literature bigger thomas is hired as a chauffeur by the millionaire dalton a man who maintains his fortune by owning such ratinfested tenements as the one bigger lives in and who eases his conscience by such acts as sending pingpong tables to the south side boys club or hiring negro servants with the intention of helping them to complete their education his first night on the job bigger is assigned to drive daltons twentyyearold daughter mary to an evening class at the university of chicago but she instead directs him to a spot at which they pick up marys boy friend jan erlone a communist the two young whites sit in the front seat with bigger and persuade him to show them around the south side but their protestations of friendship and concern with the plight of the negro succeed only in filling big ger with confusion fear and resentment at the end of the evening after jan has been dropped off bigger discovers to his terror that mary is too drunk to get up to her room without his help filled with apprehension he brings her upstairs and has just stretched her out on the bed when marys mother aroused from her sleep appears at the door of the room mrs dalton is blind and bigger horrified at the prospect of being found in a situation which has traditionally meant death for the black man presses a pillow over the semiconscious marys face to keep her from crying out after mrs dalton leaves bigger discovers that he has killed mary this is the moment when he is transformed until now most of the acts of his life including his accidental killing of mary had been motivated by the fear into which oppression had driven him now suddenly his whole existence had become the determination of his own free and transcendent will released from its lifelong bondage by this single act though he had killed by accident not once did he feel the need to tell himself that it had been an accident he was black and he had been alone in a room where a white girl had been killed therefore he had killed her that was what everybody would say anyhow no matter what he said and in a certain sense he knew that the girls death had not been accidental he had killed many times before only on these other times there had been no handy victim or circumstance to make visible or dramatic his will to kill his crime seemed natural he felt that all of his life had been leading to something like this it was no longer a matter of dumb wonder as to what would happen to him and his black skin he knew now the hidden meaning of his lifea meaning which others did not see and which he had always tried to hidehad spilled out from this moment until biggers capture by the police on a snowcovered tenement rooftop some two hundred pages later the novel is pure movement the kind of overwhelming narrative torrent that wright had already made into a trademark in a story like down by the riverside in native son this narrative flow serves the additional function of showing what has happened to biggers existence every one of his acts now in contrast with the torpor that had prevailed in the descriptions of his life prior to the murder of mary dalton is swift vigorous and meaningful another element in a headlong process of selfdefinition wright spares no horror in this unfolding of the hidden meaning of his protagonists existence biggers ultimate and most completely unforgivable act of violent selfassertion is his murder of his mistress bessie with whom he has shared his secret and whose life has therefore become intolerable to him according to constance webb wright wanted to include this episode in the novel so that there would be no mistaking biggers stark responsibility for his acts no catering to the sensibilities of bankers daughters in retrospect it seems also to be another of the novels prophetic glimpses of the ghetto revolt of the sixties ultimately turning against itself and burning down homes with black women and children inside this then is the culminating act of biggers selfemancipating revolt his one unequivocally wilful act of annihilationperformed upon a poor black workinggirl did wright mean for the irony to read this way is it an intended qualification to his vision of a black revolutionary apocalypse or an inadvertent prophecy miss webb does not tell us but this much must be said if this is ultimately the outcome of biggers revolt then it is not so likely to disturb the sensibilities of bankers daughters after all the last third of the novel dealing with biggers imprisonment and trial is wrights final bout with the communist worldview and the narrative moves slowly and indecisively again wright is more or less victorious this i have come to feel since but he wins only narrowly by a decision rather than with a joe louis knockout blow he seems to want to give what he can back to the communists after the heresy he has committed in the first twothirds of the book it is only they for example who show compassion and some understanding towards bigger and he is deeply appreciative of this despite his refusal to be categorized by them as a mere phenomenon of the oppressed part of mankind i didnt want to kill but what i killed for i am he defiandy tells the communist lawyer to the latters horror jan erlone whose girl friend bigger has murdered and upon whom he had tried to shift the blame for the crime is the very soul of forgiveness the old lawyer max tries to defend bigger from the death sentence in a long courtroom summation indicting societys injustices max is even able to see beneath the blanket of communist myth the more unruly revolutionary force that bigger represents kill this boy he tells the court and makes thousands of other black men and women feel that the barriers are tighter and higher kill him and swell the tide of pentup lava that will some day break loose not in a single blundering accidental individual crime but in a wild cataract of emotion that will brook no control but ultimately it is max who comes forth not only in the courtroom but within wrights internal moral dialectic as the last defender of the old vision of a coalition of the oppressed bigger dont you know they hate others too who they hate they hate trade unions they hate folks who try to organize but they hate black folks more than they hate unions bigger said they dont treat union folks like they do me oh yes they do you think that because your color makes it easier for them to point you out segregate you exploit you but they do that to others too they hate me because im trying to help you theyre writing me letters calling me a dirty jew it seems to me that this passage is demonstrative of wrights ambivalence about the clean break he is here trying to make with the vision represented by communism today we can see as clearly through some of maxs nineteenthirties myths as wright was doing then they certainly do hate black folks more than they hate unions furthermore in america they hate negroes more than they hate jews but europe in was something else again jews had already been made into the negroes of nazi germany as an overture to mass slaughter wright was undoubtedly sensitive to this as he always was to a european perspective upon things indeed this sensitivity was communisms permanent legacy to him for he had no sooner broken a few years after this with the essentially european mythsystem that communism represented than he went to europe and absorbed a new set of its myths to explain the world the spirit of max partly consumed in a european nostalgia shared by every american jewish intellectual was never completely exorcised by wright he had absorbed this nostalgia as part of his education and his vision of black revolt was as blurred by it as his pursuit of the vision was spurred by a passion to shake it off this is the meaning of biggers final but somehow inconclusive show of defiance before max in his death cell ending with a faint wry bitter smile through the bars as the lawyer walks down the corridor here is the way wrights revolt ends not with a bang but a smirk ralph ellison has pointed out the basic ambiguity of native son wherein in order to translate biggers complicated feelings into universal ideas wright had to force into biggers consciousness concepts and ideas which his intellect could not formulate between wrights skill and knowledge and the potentials of biggers mute feelings lay a thousand years of conscious culture in his search after a certain notion of the primitive wright had come dangerously close to creating a character who was a mere vehicle for ideas bigger still works despite the ambiguity but wrights growing preoccupation with the metaphysics of blackness turned many of the characters he subsequently created into hardly more than metaphors constance webb tells us that in the years immediately following the publication of native sonthe war years wright completed another lengthy manuscript for a novel about a woman who whitened her skin by taking arsenic wafers orally which was never published even though its author was now famous wright also published a long short story in this period the man who lived underground which is about a negro who escaping from a false murder charge takes refuge in a sewer from there he sees numerous vignettes of the life of the city through cellar openings and holes in walls it is an interesting attempt to use blackness as a metaphor for the condition known in jewish literature as that of one who sees but is not seen but the ideaoriginally inspired by a reading of dostoyevskyis more appealing than the realization is successful and it was eventually to be used to much better effect bv ralph ellison with whom wright apparently often discussed its mplications black boy published in wrights first book to appear in the five years since native sonis his masterpiece and yet it would seem from miss webbs narrative that it was written almost inadvertently after wrights agent surprised him by suggesting that he try an autobiography persuaded to drop the mantle of a writer of fiction for a moment although he uses the techniques of the novel here most effectively wright has recourse in this book to telling it like it is without drawing upon his arsenal of symbolism and melodramatic plotmaking a simple and powerful account of his boyhood and young manhood in the south it is his one booklength narrative that does not border on solipsism but contains a whole array of real characterizations even the whites that appear almost all of them as persecutors are more real and hence human than such caricatures as dalton or the private detective in native son focusing more resolutely on real experience than he had ever done before wright had lighted upon conventions that were for the first time entirely his own evoking as ellison says the paradoxical almost surreal image of a black boy singing the blues lustily as he probes his own grievous wound the book suggests possibilities for a whole genre of negro writing signs of which we are now beginning to see today but in wrights own life and work black boy proved to be the swan song of his struggle to achieve his own identity as a writer and a man in america in the latter half of he visited france as the guest of its government and in the summer of the following year he brought his wife and fiveyearold daughter to paris to settle there for good having found life as a negro in america intolerable enoush for himself he came to feel that he could not conceive of it for his daughter france had presented to him the prospect of an entirely different way of life he would be an outsider there too but more as an exiled american intellectual than as a negro although france is far from colorblind it is at any rate less colorconscious than almost any other western nation furthermore within that most remarkable of meltingpots the paris intelligentsiaby whom wright had been warmly received during his visithis color did not stand so much for a complex and burdensome ethnic fact as for a principle of sartrean authenticity it was a mere outward representation of some particular angle of vision within the universalist brotherhood of leftbank artists and intellectuals by merely trading in the lilt with which he once had sung the blues wright became eligible to put on the frenchmade mantle of negri tude whose graceful and classic lines obscured the homely contours of mississippi and chicago in other words his color became in france what he had always sought to make it a kind of metaphor this transmutation is reflected in wrights next book the outsider published in his first in eight years it is a novel laden with language and concepts borrowed from french existentialism discussions of bad faith a title from camus letranger better known in english as the stranger can also be translated the outsider even a district attorney who says to the protagonist that he has committed the greatest crime of all because you didnt bat your eye when i told you that your mother was dead cross damon a new variant of bigger thomas perceived through the french philosophical sensibility commits a series of murders that read like ritual metaphors for the series of rejections wright had made in his own life damon begins by murdering himself as it were narrowly escaping with his life from a chicago train accident he discovers that another passenger who was killed has been mistaken for him and he decides to accept this going later to watch his own funeral from a distance then damon is recognized by a friend whom he encounters by chance and he kills him rather than have to return to a life he had found intolerable he leaves his native chicago and goes to new york where under an assumed identity he becomes involved with communists a young communist couple gil blount ne bernstein and his wife eva take him in as a boarder in order to challenge the racist policies of their landlord enraged at the sight of a negro in his building the landlord gets into a fight with blount and damon when he discovers the two of them lying unconscious from each others blows finishes the job and kills them botha plague on both their houses the next day damon kills another communist who is suspicious of him and becomes the lover of blounts widow eva for an outsider sans identity any expression of his contempt for the worlds myths has been possible but now he shows one fatal weakness he falls in love with eva and is broken when she commits suicide after learning the truth about him this is his one display of humanity in the whole novel in the end it is not the law but the communists who destroy him shooting him down in the street the thrust of wrights work had now brought him to a point of extreme alienation his next novel savage holidaywhich appeared directly in a paperback edition because his regular publisher harper brothers would not handle it is a suspense thriller about a retired white insurance executive who stepping out of the shower to pick up his newspaper in the hallway one sunday morning finds himself trapped there naked when his door accidentally slams shut caught naked in the hallwaythis is what had become of wrights creative metaphor of his very inner identity during the next few years wright made strenuous efforts to recover roots for a theme that had now become in literary terms a mere abstraction in he visited the future republic of ghana as the guest of prime minister nkrumah and wrote a book about his observations under the prophetic title black_power continuing to pursue the possibilities of reportage as a literary outlet for himself he undertook two major journeys in pursuit of material during the summer and fall of to spain and to the bandung conference as the title of his book pagan spain indicates his trip to that countrythe one country of the western world about which as though shunning the memory of a bad love affair i did not until now want to exercise my mind was a recapitulation of his old question for a primitive reality behind the mask of communist myth pagan spain whose border with france marks the termination of europe and the beginning of africa was the dark truth that had reposed beneath the rightleft conventions of the spanish civil war era so also at the bandung conference did wright perceive an underlying realityformed out of race and religionthat was beyond left and right he was thus moving in the direction of what was in fact another leftwing myth that of the third worldwhich was being generated in france during this period it was a possible outcome of the logic of his own development in a sense bigger thomas could be viewed retrospectively as a representative of frantz fanons theories about the selfrealization of the colonized through violent revolt but this in the end would tend to make biaser as much a creature of jeanpaul sartres universe as the lawyer max had wanted to make him of the universe of american communism in the nineteenthirties wright did not seem content with this resolution either he had been very keenly aware for example of the gulf between himself and the black man of africa during his trip there the short time that now remained of his life was filled with what seems to have been a frantic struggle to recover his themes as he thrashed about through possibilities both old and new he tried writing again about the negro in the american south but the resulting novel the long dream published in was severely criticized for its manifest remoteness from reality it was far more popular in france than in the united states his short stories mere fanciful creations were better because they were able to bear up somehow under the weight of being intellectual constructs a story published in big black good man suggests the possibility that the course of wrights sensibility was seeking to come full circle it tells of an elderly hotel clerk in denmark who is terrified one night by an enormous black man who comes asking for a room and a prostitute the clerk becomes obsessed with this giant whose sexuality seems to be as overwhelming as his appearance as he fills his order night after night then one evening as if in fulfillment of a recurring nightmare the negro comes in and wraps his huge hands about the clerks throat but takes them away momentarily and leaves it is only after months in which the clerk has endless morbid fantasies about him that the negro returns to the hotel again beckons to the clerk andpresents him with some shirts in gratitude for services rendered the terrifying hands around the clerks neck had been estimating his shirt size the frightening guest was a big black good man after all does the similarity of name to those of big boy and bigger suggest what wright was trying to do it is one of his few stories displaying some of the sunniness and humor for which he was apparently well known in person was he making his peace at last and if so where was it to take him no one will ever know for he was dead three years later in the fall of in the posthumous collection of richard wrights short stories that was published in eight men the final piece called the man who went to chicago is not a work of fiction but a memoir an excerpt from the final and unpublished third of his manuscript for black boy it tells among other things of a brief period shortly after his arrival in chicago from the south when he held a job as a clerk in a delicatessen run by an elderly jewish couple the relations between them and himself that he describes are an odd mixture of decency and strained understanding his employers were kind but not always patient he for his own part guiltily remembered some of the antisemitic folklore of his childhood one day mrs hoffman asked him to go to a nearby store to pick up a can of cheek keen awr lar keeng utterly baffled he asked her to repeat this several times until she lost her temper crying dont you know nosing when he asked her to write it down she protested that she was unable to write finally he learned the syllables by rote went on his errand and was handed a can of chicken a la king muttering curses on the way back he reflected bitterly though english was my native tongue and america my native land she an alien could operate a store and earn a living in a neighborhood where i could not even live i reasoned further that she was aware of this and trying to protect her position against me shortly after that when the time came for a scheduled civil service exam he took off from work three days in a row to prepare for it and take it not wanting the hoffmans to know he was looking for another job he told them the next day that his mother had died and he had gone to memphis for the funeral but they did not believe him the more they refused to accept his story the more he persisted in it until mrs hoffman protested we treat you nice dont we his anger at them grew with his shame and at the end of the week when his civil service job came up he left them without even saying he would not be back the next day it was not until i had left the delicatessen job that i saw how grossly i had misread the motives and attitudes of mr hoffman and his wife i had not yet learned anything that would have helped me to thread my way through these perplexing racial relations accepting my environment at its face value trapped by my own emotions i kept asking myself what had black people done to bring this crazy world upon them i know the hoffmans because they are in a sense my parents and i too have rejected them werent they also the parents of jan erlone and the lawyer maxs cousins perhaps they were among the storekeepers who gazed out their windows with blanched faces at the rioters the night of joe louis victory over max baer a lot has happened since then and they are long since gone or going those elderly storekeepers some bearing the scars of their munderstandings others unreconciled but all all passing to the next generation a challenge with which it was difficult for them to cope has the time come to find peace in that legacy is this what wright was trying to come back to from the lonely exile into which that old strife had driven him
the strident voices of black selfassertion and the bittersweet f gropings towards afroamerican identity which now fill the i dark ghettos of the nation seem to provide a strange and a most embarrassing backdrop to the largely unnoticed approach of another negro history week indeed the juxtaposition of such a typically american institution against the broad panorama of our newest coming of blackness is likely a testimony to a frame of mind which must not go unchallenged at so pregnant a moment in the nations life evidently there are many wellmeaning persons who think of negro history in the context of the overall american story in much the same way that they think of individual negroes and their integration into the american society that is they are adamantly and often vociferously in favor of small but prominent doses of negro history being dropped into the national saga but they insist that these black drops should never be numerous or indelible for if they are too many and too black they might necessitate unpleasant rereadings reassessments and rewritings of the entire story and such adjustments would never be tolerated by the american society to say nothing of the historical professionor so the unspoken lines seem to go it is my thesis and partly the motivation for my work that an american history which cannot contain the full story of the black pilgrimage is no more worthy of life than an american society that cannot bear the full and troublesome black presence in its midst indeed it is my intention to suggest that just as america can know no survival worth considering unless it finds a way of facing its black counterimage so too our history is a tale told by fools if it does not incorporate the afroamerican experience with unflinching integrity and if such open encounter between black and white american history should produce the same sense of insecure teetering on the edge of the unknown as we now experience in the human encounter so much the better nor does the analogy end there the urgency some of us feel for the creation of such a new american history is no less critical than the pressure that impels us to seek for the lineaments of a new american society obviously the tasks are not unrelated for there will be no new beginnings for a nation that refuses to acknowledge its real past therefore the uses of the afroamerican past are many varied and crucial at this difficult but inevitable juncture in american life they will be examined here in stages ranging from the obvious to the enigmatic at that end of the continuum most flooded with the light of reason it should be clear that any american history that ignores the central role of black people as actors and foils on this maddening stage is a falsified and misleading history it is for instance a history that ignores the ironic symbol of that summer in jamestown more than three centuries ago when representative government and african bondsmen had a mutual beginning of sorts in the citadel of colonial democracy a beginning that seemed to lock the rhetoric of democracy and the reality of black inequality into the american heart it is a history that tries to explore the making of the constitution without understanding the major price in its integrity that was exacted by the system of slavery and its proponents both north and south it is a history that attempts to speak of the peculiar institution as if there were no human beings involved who produced no authentic historical materials thus a major publisher could attempt last year to produce a collection of documents on slavery without one document from a slave it is a history that speaks of jacksonian democracy as if the expanded white franchise were not purchased at the cost of the black northern vote in many states such a vacuous history treats reconstruction as if it were another unfortunate mistake rather than one of the nations greatest lost chances to be honest and free it is a history that deals with the turn of the nineteenth century without suggesting the way in which the rising tide of brutality against blacks and indians at home may have permanently poisoned the nations attempts at expansion among nonwhite peoples elsewhere it is a history that tries to understand the urban crisis of the s without tracing the long and bloody lines of negro migration since reconstruction it is a history that attempts to interpret current american culture without any appreciation for the major role black people have played in creating the popular culture of the nation especially since the s it may well be that a history without the afroamerican story cannot offer sufficient insights into the reasons why the nation can now be so numb to the brutalization of a vietnam thousands of miles away perhaps it cannot understand this because it denies the physical and spiritual destruction of black persons which has become a part of the american way of life and has likely created a callous on whatever heart a nation has it is such a history that has contributed immensely to the miseducation of the american people and has brought them so unprepared to face a world that is neither white christian capitalist nor affluent such history may yet prove poisonous and if there is any possible antidote on the american scene it could be the hard and bitter medicine of the afroamerican past is it too late for a society that still insists that its drops be few and painless this question will be examined more fully below now it is important to recognize another obvious use of the afroamerican past even when one acknowledges how grotesquely slow is the pace at which black people are moving on to the american stage the knowledge of their history is still absolutely indispensable as they proceed it is essential on the one hand to the oldnew comers as they cast off the roles of the past and seek for new ones if they come to the integrated scene with integrity they must come with a knowledge of themselves and of the manysplendored gifts they bring black students in formerly white schools must not enter as suppliants who are going to be transformed from disadvantaged to advantaged buy such a move they must be so aware of their black fathers and the wealth of their soiritual and intellectual heritage that they will sharply illuminate the disadvantages inherent in an isolated beleaguered middleclass white world if they are to become more than black anglosaxons and god knows we have enough white ones without adding carbon copies then they cannot accept the old doctrines of slavery which encouraged them to believe that god somehow blessed darkest africa with the light of christian guns and shins and chains neither the ancient kingdom of songhai nor the modern kingdom of harlem was benighted without whites and black young people need to know the measurements of the lightin both places any society that would encourage black children to live in a state of permanent amnesia or shameor bothconcerning their fathers and their fathers ways of life is a society not worth knowing any men who would enter such a society on its amnesiac terms would only add to its corruption whether they entered through the door of the ninth grade or by the carpeted way of a general electric executive suite but it must also be acknowledged that such knowledge is exceedingly dangerous for if it were faithfully presented a reading of the afroamerican past might cause black exiles to refuse many an open door indeed some doors might be torn from their hinges nor would this be teaching hatred of whites rather it would be the necessary and healthy explanation for the existence of the hatred and fear that most black men have known from childhood on any society lacking the courage to take such risks with light lacks the courage to live on the other obvious hand those white persons who first encounter the token blacks in their new roles are also in desperate need of the afroamerican past for without it they will be tempted to feel that they are doing a favor for the students or the junior executives by letting them in properly read the pages of the negro past will reveal that it is black people who have done the favor by doing so much to build the nation under such horrible circumstances and by letting such ambiguous doors stay on their hinges for so long a time compassionately understood the black past will teach all benefactors that they are receiving a favor in being allowed what may be the one last chance to do justice that they are being graced by the presence of a people whose pilgrimage is perhaps the only true epic poem that america has ever known such a reading of the afroamerican past might even shatter the general illusion that token acceptance of token negroes will ever bring any basic hope for the survival of any of us perhaps the issue of survival suggests another level of our need for he story of this dark journey in america not long ago the most highly esteemed newspaper in america asked an author to write his reflections on the reasons for the current breaking of america into two parts based on race when it rips apart all the easy generalizations of our textbooks written largely by for and about white america the new coming of black history would cast such a question into limbo for any perceptive apprehension of the negrowhite encounter cannot fail to reveal that there have always been two major communities in this nationbased on race the breaking began in west africa and continued in every colony and state that came into being if we read with both speed and comprehension it may not be too late to ask the right questions questions based not on newark or detroit in but on jamestown and philadelphia and springfield and st louis over the centuries for it is only as america faces a denmark vesey a nat turner a w e b du bois a paul robeson and a malcolm_x that the nation will begin to be ready to understand a stokely carmichael a rap brown and the host of black radicals yet to come such a reading would identify each one as made in america product of its broken community how shall this land create new and whole men if it refuses to examine its past production record a record strewn with the crushed bodies and spirits of black radicals hurling defiant curses and urgent pleas for renewal from the same dying lips at the identical insistent moment it is these angry young men whose lives demonstrate the fact that the afroamerican past and the black present are no longer matters of limited national concernif they ever were indeed they suggest to us what may be one of the most profound and universally significant uses of this history that is its service as an entrance to the nonwhite nonwestern world let me elaborate on what i mean one of the most gifted and least celebrated american political analysts used to say that the basic division in the world now and for some time to come was not based on communism versus capitalism rather a j muste said the world was divided now between those peoples who had rarely if ever known defeat and humiliation as a national experience and those who had lived with this for centuries in a sense muste was simply echoing the profound insights expressed by w e b du bois half a century earlier however formulated the concepts of these men remind us that the world experience of the last years has meant that the vast majority of the earths humiliated people have been nonwhite and their humiliation has come at the hands of the white western world moreover it appears that this nation now stands as the selfproclaimed leader of that unhumiliated world and finds itself at once the most powerful and one of the least comprehending national states it is obvious that one of americas most critical blind areas is in the realm of understanding the oppressed the wretched of the earth our vaunted experience of virtually unbroken success our alabaster cities undimmed by human tears except for the unseen tears of the poor and the black and our movement into the strange joys of advanced corporate capitalismall these have cut this people off from the rest of the world in significant ways if there is any real concern among the american people to understand why men are determined to fight bombers with rifles and curses why revolutions seem to grow up wherever americas footprints mark the earth then the afroamerican story is essential reading for here in the heart of america is the nations major link to the alienated humiliated and rebellious nonwhite world its story is at once tied to the nonwest and a part of the american past indeed richard wright says the history of black folk is the history of america written in bloody terms a failure to explore this vital link on its own terms through its own history might well prove disastrous not only within the nation but at every troubled spot where this nation reaches out its ambiguous hands beyond the west without such an exploration we might continue to be puzzled at the worlds disbelief concerning our sudden devotion to the rights of selfdetermination for the nonwhite masses of vietnam a nation that combines the american predilection towards violence the american stockpile of weapons and the american lack of empathy for the earths humiliated peoples is a dangerous nation perhaps it can begin another life by introducing itself to the invisible men in its midst by seeking to know the quality of suffering and hurt and the rebellion they spawn such an introduction must includeif not begin withthe past nor are black americans excused from such a task for we are constantly exposed to a terrible temptation to forget the black and bloody ground out of which we sprang as the price for american acceptance as du bois put it more than a decade ago most american negroes even those of intelligence and courage do not fully realize that they are being bribed to trade equal status in the united states for the slavery of the majority of men so the afroamerican past must remind black people that we are children of the humiliated and the oppressed that our fathers were colonized and exploited subjects and that the ghettos we have recently left are still too often filled with the stench of poverty and despair such history must remind afroamericans that all of our greatest leaders have begged us to stand in solidarity with the black and anguished people of the earth we are their spokesmen in the midst of the worlds foremost antirevolutionary power if we forsake them we forsake our past our fathers and our own best selves if we forsake them there may be no future for our children or theirs if we forget our own fathers burnings in village squares and on american uniforms to set fires against the worlds desperate revolutions we will deserve nothing but the scorn of men and the judgement of the gods reference to the nations lack of empathy with the desperate men of the earth suggests yet another closely related use of the afroamerican past some years ago d w brogan that english expert on american affairs referred to what he called the myth of american omnipotence his use of this phrase referred of course to his conviction that the reading of the american past was distorted by a conception of this nation as an entity incapable of failure powerful and pure enough to succeed at anything it chose the corollary of this myth said brogan in the days of mccarthys reign was that any american failure at home or overseas had to be explained by subversion or conspiracies orat worsta mistake in wellintentioned american judgement now related to brogans myth is what might be called the myth of american romanticism ever since the nations beginning it has been plagued by this equally crippling misconception of itself succinctly put this misconception involves a belief that american history is the story of a society moving on a straight upward line from perfection to perfection from goodness to betterness from being better than other nations to being the best and most complete nation that god had ever stood over i take it that is the implication of being under god this mythology was intensified to the point of indoctrination after world war ii when history became a tool of the cold war and it became necessary to prove consistently the superiority of america over every conceivable communist socialist or neutralist model in the world this is a selfimage on the level with fairy tales and happiness forever after it is the selfunderstanding of those whose adult development has been aborted by the fear of the risks of growth most importantly it is a refusal to recognize the bloody tragic line that whips its way through all of life failure to face the tragic is failure to mature in national as well as personal spheres so in the midst of this pabulum view of history a serious implanting of the afroamerican past could be the difference between death and growthat least spiritually for if there is any story that would fling america up against the tragic elements of her history it is the story of that oldnew people created here by force annealed by the heat of suffering into afroamericans were american historians and american citizens at large to face this story manyif not allof their liberal superficial myths about and hopes foramerican society might be transformed they would need to face again the fact that two of their greatest heroes jefferson and lincoln were convinced that black and white people could never live on a basis of true equality in america they would be pressed to realize that the great emancipator cared far more deeply for a cheaply won white reconciliation than for the very costly black liberation thereby helping to lead the nation down bloody paths of malice for all the close reading of the black past might reveal how fully this broken people has tested every line of american democratic rhetoric and how fully each word has shrunken before the ultimate test in every generation they would also see the pathetic and perennial sight of esteemed national leaders offering solutions a generation old to wounds long past such ancient salves a reading of the black preachers poets and editors a sensitive listening to the singers of our songs would face the nation with the ceaseless rage that has been the lot of men in every strange land who have been called upon to sing to dance to laugh and to be grateful and in those pages any searching eye would easily spy the centuryold predictions of black alienation sedition rebellion and guerrilla warfare disaster has always lurked at the american door tragic disaster created largely by blindness to the nations fatal flaw not only would the tragic nature of american life perhaps become more clear but the afroamerican story would remind the nation that it was conceived as an experiment an experiment that could yet fail miserably utterly explosively almost a century ago henry adams described the america of as very healthy except for the cancer of slavery the irony and the tragedy of a very healthy cancerous body is still the american condition and though no cure has yet been found for the cancer it may not be too late to open the blind eyes to see its sources in the past and what if we open our eyes only to discover that jefferson and lincoln and many black men were right that present white prejudice and black bitterness and unbroken lines of injustice from the past now make it impossible for us to continue together in integrity is it better to go on in blind selfrighteous rage towards internecine struggle or to see finally see with sad and mature clarity the pathway down from all our past romantic dreamsincluding the dream of integration the black experience in america allows for no illusions not even that last ancient hope of the chosen american people whom god will somehow rescue by a special act of his grace america began with such hopes but they were tied to the idea of a covenant that men would have to do gods will for them to remain as his chosen ones somehow just as america forced black men to do so much of its other dirty but productive work the nation evidently came to believe that whites could be chosen while blacks did that suffering which has always been identified with the chosen ones now that is over the black past has begun to explode and to reveal to a hiding chosen people that to be the annointed one is to be crushed and humiliated by the forces of the world after almost years how significant a period of exile the black branch of the chosen people has grown louder than ever before in its refusal to take the sufferings apart from the privileges of the chosen status so it may be that for all who see it the afroamerican past illuminates the meaning of being chosen perhaps this is what white americans must see that they will either join the ranks of suffering and humiliation beginning perhaps with losing face in vietnam or there will be no chosen people on these shores either they will submit their children to some of the same educational terrors they have allowed black children to endure or there is no future for any either they will give up their affluence to provide necessities for others or there will be neither affluence nor necessities for anyone perhaps we were chosen together and we cannot move towards a new beginning until we have faced all the horror and agony of the past with absolute honesty perhaps integration is indeed irrelevant until the assessment of a long unpaid debt has been made and significant payments begun perhaps atonement not integration is the issue at hand of course one last shattering possibility may remain it could be that the message of the afroamerican past is this only one branch of the chosen people has really paid the dues of sufferingwith the scars to show for it therefore it may be that only the black branch will be allowed to shape the future of the nation and to determine its calling for the world perhaps only black people are open enough and sensitive enough and scarred enough as a group to lead this nation into true community with the nonwhite humiliated world perhaps that world of sufferers will trust no american leaders save those who bear the marks of oppression in their souls perhaps it will listen only to those who know the tragic sense of life and are not blind and calloused bearers of death perhaps it is already time for the last to be first in our nation how shall that overturning come that knowledge may be too great for even the afroamericans past to bear perhaps our black history can only bear witness to the truth and living men must shape that truth into new action and new history to those who would close their ears to such interpretations of the black past to those who would tune out because such strange musings seem unrelated to the historians vocation i would leave you only with the word of a white radical who read black history with some care before an audience of wellmeaning whites in a time of similar crisis he spoke on the afroamerican past focussing on the greatness of a black leader named toussaint holding louverture above the great white heroes of the age then wendell phillips set out these words you think me a fanatic tonight for you read history not with your eyes but with your prejudices so spoke a man who believed that there was no healing for america either in small black drops of history or in small black drops of negro freedom had the nation heard his word and followed his uses of the past we might well have been spared most of the bloody days between and the terrorfilled nights yet to come will there be time before the last night we who are black we who have lived in night and waited long in darkness may have a special word of light for a stumbling powerbound people we do not panic easily shall the word be heard only those with ears can say it is our calling our vocation to speak it and if the last darkness should fall it is preferable that we be found standing faithful to all the agonizing sorrowjoy of our afroamerican past than lost and sullen black defenders of a world that sucked out our memory and bleached our minds such a land deserves no defense better that it pass and make way for whatever is yet to comeeven if it be the longdelayed last silence or will it be the drums of morning i do not know the afroamerican past leaves a man with no illusions but even in the heart of chaos it does not strip him of his hope we have come too far through too much chaos to cop out here until about years ago negro historians were almost j it t z totally ignored by white historians and their various historj i i f ical associations although many negro historians had been v jfj trained at the best american universities they were not con sidered objective enough to write negro history and it went without saying that negro historians could not write about whites there was an upper class snoobishness in the white historians holding history as the grandest and most exclusive of the scholarly disciplines and so although negro historians have a long and outstanding history and are responsible for nearly all truthful negro history the writing about them by negroes and whites has been fragmentary there are the scattered notes on negro historians in vernon loggins the negro author his development in america up to and in john hope franklins from slavery to freedom joseph grimes page unpublished masters thesis a study of the negro historian university of iowa a brief introductory section on the negro historian in the negro caravan two articles by helen boardman and carter g woodson on the rise of the negro historian and negro historians of our time respectively negro history bulletin april a section of herbert apthekers article negro history arsenal for liberation new masses feb on negro historians e e thorpes article on negro writers of negro church history southern university bulletin fall and occasional articles on individual negro historians such as george washington williams william wells brown and carter g woodson in the journal of negro history and other periodicals and that was all of the bibliography until the negro scholar e e thorpes small book negro historians in the united states was published in since then we have had sections of thorpes the mind of the negro and august meiers negro thought in america devoted to negro historians the first negro history was written by negro and white defenders of the race early in the nineteenth century as mostly biographical sketches of distinguished negroes this work was the american counterpart of abbe gregoires de la litterature des negres translated in the first two works by negroes that could be called history were paul cuffes brief account of the settlement and present situation of the colony of sierra leone in africa published in and prince saunders haytian papers a collection of very interesting proclamations and other official documents together with some account of the rise progress and present state of the kingdom of haiti published in in london and in america later came robert b lewis light and truth in republished in in an enlarged edition the first extensive effort of an american negro to dig into the story of his past in j w c pennington published a history for school children arranged in questionanswer form titled a text book of the origin and history of the colored people also in james mccune smith gave a lecture of the hayden revolution with a sketch of toussaint louverture pennington published his slave narrative the fugitive blacksmith in as did many other negro exslaves who wrote or dictated narratives both before and after penningtons the most important of these is the narrative of frederick douglass which went through three different editions over the years the first negro to do the research and interpretation of a historian was william c nell whose pamphlet services of colored americans in the wars of and was published in and a larger revised book edition of this later in titled the colored patriots of the american revolution with sketches of several distinguished colored persons to which is added a brief survey of the condition and prospects of colored americans here the main themes that were to be the chief concerns of the negro historian for a long time were set forth the negros military service biographical sketches of the few distinguished negroes and the united states race problem an early work dealing with the last of these three themes is the condition elevation emigration and destiny of the colored people of the united states politically considered by martin r delany a negro physician and cofounder and assistant editor of frederick douglass newspaper north star delany also wrote blake or the huts of america the third novel by an american negro the second novel was frank w webbs the garies and their friends there were early negro church historians christopher rush an early church worker and a founder of the phoenix society in wrote with george collins the history of the ame church in republished in william t catto in wrote the history of the first african presbyterian church in philadelphia and william douglass recorded in the annals of the first african church in the usa other negro church historians will be taken up later william wells brown abolitionist lecturer and writer and author of clotel or the presidents daughter the first novel by an american negro in turned early to the writing of history he published his historical lecture st domingo its revolutions and its patriots emphasizing toussaint louverture in and the black man his antecedents his genius and achievements more biographical than historical in these were followed by the negro in the american rebellion his heroism and his fidelity the first book of the records of negro troops contrabands and slaves during the civil war and later in the rising son or the antecedents and advancement of the colored race a large work that included much that had gone into the earlier books william still an antislavery negro worker in philadelphia kept in a secret place voluminous records of the fugitive slaves and their rescuers from to in he compiled his thick volume the underground railroad a record of facts authentic narratives letters etc republished in joseph t wilson the negro historian of the grand army of the republic wrote several histories just after this j including emancipation its course and progress from bc to ad and the black phalanx a history of the negro in the civil war but pennington nell brown and still were more abolitionists than historians edward w blyden was academically equipped to write history but he wrote mostly about the problems of the colony of liberia west africa and africa in general the first negro historian whose scholarship made him worthy of serious attention was george washington williams a pennsylvanian and a civil war soldier who had been educated in massachusetts aware of the importance of structure as well as the researching of facts williams made his twovolumed history of the negro race in america from to a landmark in historical writing which is still useful today he followed this up with a history of the negro troops in the war of the rebellion a book that was still considered until recently by many as the best book on the negro in the civil war williams won recognition from the white literary world he was called the negro bancroft there were other biographical historical works by negroes during this period such as william j simmons men of mark a dictionary of negro biography john wallaces carpetbag rule in florida reprinted in about reconstruction in florida and e a johnsons a school history of the negro race in america there were later negro church histories such as daniel a paynes history of the a me church j w hoods history of the amez church bishop charles henry phillips history of the colored methodist episcopal church in america and other church works by b t tanner and lewis j jordan there were also several good biographies of john brown at this time by the white writers f b sanborn r j hinton james redpath w e connelley and others but the first scientific study of negro history was w e b du bois doctoral dissertation in history at harvard university the suppression of the african slavetrade to the united states of america published in as volume one in the harvard historical studies series authoritative and scholarly and written by one of the giants of negro history this work was reprinted in by the social science press and in by russell and russell both in new york city the period from the late s through the s was one in which great efforts were made by negroes to write about their own history and culture and to counter the terrible racist propaganda spewed by u s books newspapers and magazines at that time the american negro historical society of philadelphia was organized in to collect relics and facts of negro progress and development the more influential negro society for historical research was started by j e bruce and a a schomburg in and the association for the study of negro life and history was organized by carter g woodson in some of the earlier books of negro history by negroes during this period after the du bois work of are w h councills lamp of wisdom or race history illuminated rev c t walkers appeal to caesar rev harvey johnsons the nations from a new point of view and pauline hopkins

proclamation and the th anniversary of the landing of the negro in america he did not get the financial support he needed to complete the project at that time but he did read a paper on reconstruction and its benefits before the american historical association in du bois published in that very important pioneering anthropological book on african history in the home university library series titled the negro and the gift of black folk negroes in the making of america in the latter had historical chapters on black explorers and other negro subjects another giant of negro history was carter g woodson who worked his way up from former slave parents through the west virginia coal mines to a phd in history at harvard in he founded the association for the study of negro life and history in and published the same year the education of the negro prior to woodson started the journal of negro history in and thereafter published by the association in rapid succession a series of volumes of negro

states woodson also started the annual celebration of negro history week in arthur a schomburg in his article the negro digs up his past in alain lockes book the new negro an interpretation declared that the american negro must remake his past in order to make his future for him a group tradition must supply compensation for persecution and pride of race the antidote for prejudice this was a part of the credo of the harlem negro renaissance movement of the s schomburgs projected negro history in outline scheduled to appear in in the bronze booklets series published by the associates in negro folk education washington d c was written but never put into final form for publication as schomburg died in the manuscript is still held by one of his daughters also during the twenties benjamin g

history of negro suffrage and white politics in the south reprinted in then came w e b du bois great work black reconstruction in america reprinted in in paperback and and the whitie marxist writer james s allens important reconstruction the battle for democracy reprinted in and two books that defended the role of negroes and radical republicans during reconstruction and repudiated the widespread opinion of the period as a tragic era productive only of evil and corruption these two works rescued reconstruction from the dominant white historiography and forced american historians to revise and reconsider their biased work on this period an encyclopedia of the negro edited by du bois and guy b johnson and sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund was started in but was published only in outline form in revised edition in the white writer wilbur h siebert author of the underground railroad brought out much later his three books of the underground railroad in massachusetts in vermont and in ohio the white anthropologist ina corinne browns the story of the american negro appeared in revised editions in and carter g woodson started the monthly negro history bulletin in for use in schools and study groups and published the story of the negro retold in for high school students merle r eppse a negro professor in the south brought out in the negro too in american history for adults and an elementary history of america for elementary school students the late white marxist historian elizabeth lawson published her very good study outline history of the american negro people

pamphlet on robert brown elliott one of the eight negro reconstruction congressmen from south carolina and a critical study of robert e lee at her death in the increasing interest in african history

herbert apthekers pamphlet negro slave revolts in the united states apthekers doctoral dissertation and definitive work american negro slaves revolts was published in and twice reprinted and kept in print by another publisher in and aptheker in the meantime had been publishing three other pamphlets the negro in the civil war the negro in the american revolution and the negro in the abolitionist movement he pulled these four pamphlets or long essays together in the book essays in the history of the american negro aptheker was to author or edit other important works in negro history such as to be free studies in american negro history essays that broke new ground a documentary history of the negro people in the united states to told in their own words paperbacked in a sorely needed book

continual cry about david walkers appeal and nat turners slave rebellion charles m witlse also brought out another edition of david walkers appeal in negro historians were also coming strongly to the

story of the negro in america and the negro e franklin fraziers the negro in the united states though sociological in its approach has important historical material and must be included here the famous negro historian john hope franklin started in the s with the publication of his doctoral dissertation the free negro in north carolina in he followed this up with what has thus far been his magnum opus from slavery to freedom a history of american negroes reprinted in and a fairly comprehensive and useful summary of negro history especially up to franklin has since authored or edited the diary of james t ayers civil war recruiter the militant south reconstruction after the civil war and the emancipation proclamation plus many scholarly articles he wrote the original not final draft of the u s commission on civil_rights report freedom to the free a centennial progress report of negroes since emancipation franklin is one of the three authors of the big pioneering integrated junior high school history textbook land of the free he also edited with isidore starr the negro in twentieth century america a reader on the struggle for civil_rights there were important contributions to negro history by white historians other than aptheker during the forties these were samuel d smiths the negro in congress henrietta buckmasters let my people go reprinted in the story of the

gross has also done important exhaustive work on james mccune smith and other important figures of negro history which should be published the works of white historians however were even more numerous during the fifties philip s foner is a prolific marxist historian whose doctoral dissertation business and slavery the new york merchants and the irrepressible conflict was published in just after this he brought out selections from the writings of frederick douglass and abraham lincoln in a pamphlet series that also included thomas jefferson and george washington foners great work in the negro

worth fighting for about the negro in the civil war and reconstruction for children in an article in the journal of negro history had called for a new interpre tation for negro history as early as in john hope franklin described new perspectives in american negro history social education and later in described the more understanding studies of the negro by white historians at that time as what actually happened to american negroes or the new negro history crisis some historians disagreed and thought that franklins claims were greatly exaggerated but some improvement had definitely taken place in the writing of negro history although there was still a long way to go in the s white historians were to do even better on a whole than they had done in the s with of course some serious regressions in both decades which we wont discuss here the civil_rights struggle of the fifties and sixties had brought in its wake a more accurate history of the negro people even by white historians the negro historians of these two decades we shall discuss later in any event there was a virtual floodtide some of the works of the sixties by white historians were j w schulte nordholts the people

off broadway perofessor richard bardolph in his book p the negro vanguard vs states that negroes were far from controlling southern politics is attested by the small number sent to washington in the four years following the war congress contained no negroes at all and in the next eight years the average was six during the reconstruction years only two negro senators were seated and representatives six from south carolina where the black population was heaviest and political activity most aggressive nine of the former slave states had no negro congress at all in the reconstruction years in the years after termination of the radical program negroes averaged only two seats per congress and in the next decade there was never more than one to represent the nations negroes by that time grown to more than n in the south between and there were negro congressmen and two senators namely hiram r revels and blanche k bruce both of mississippi revels was born of free parents in north carolina and bruce was born a slave in virginia see list at end of article which shows births and deaths of all negro congressmen during the period covered by this paper american historians generally have portrayed reconstruction era negro officials as illiterate clowns butlike so much of our history myth was allowed to overshadow fact hiram rhoades revels was the first negro to serve in the united states senate when revels took his seat in the senate he was fulfilling prophecy senator simon cameron told senator jefferson davis in when he left the senate after mississippi seceded from the union i believe in the justice of god that a negro some day will come and occupy your seat a short biography of hiram revels will help to explode the myth that reconstruction negro congressmen were not educated and well trained hiram rhoades revels was bom september at fayetteville n c he was born of free parents so he never knew the condition of servitude he left north carolina when a young man revels moved to indiana and attended the quaker seminary in union county a while later he moved to darke county ohio and attended the seminary there when he had completed this period of education he went to baltimore he was ordained in the african methodist episcopal ministry in his education was incomplete he went to illinois and graduated from knox college at bloomington after completing his education the young negro taught and lectured to his people in indiana illinois missouri kansas kentucky and tennessee at last he settled in st louis where he taught for a short while later the energetic young minister returned to preaching in cincinnati st louis pittsburgh and baltimore preacher revels was in baltimore when the civil war began he assisted in organizing the first two negro regiments raised in maryland in revels moved to st louis and founded a large school for freemen the first founded by a negro he helped to recruit a negro regiment in st louis in he went to mississippi and joined the federal army as chaplain of a negro regiment at the same time he helped the freedmens bureau to extend protection to negro troops chaplain revels crossed over from vicksburg to jackson to establish schools and churches bushwhackers almost captured him but he was warned by friends and managed to escape in he left the army and went to louisville and then to leavenworth kansas to preach in revels settled at natchez mississippi where he combined preaching with participation in politics the first republican convention ever held in mississippi met at jackson september about a third of its members were exslaves revels had been elected as alderman of natchez in he was elected to the state senate in at this time revels had received no particular attention from the reconstruction republicans but when the state legislature of mississippi convened in january preacher revels was called on to open the session with a prayer his prayer was impressive and did much to lead to his election as united states senator the minister had entered politics reluctantly because he feared his participation would cause racial friction he was careful to never prostitute the pulpit to partisan purposes as some were accused of doing mississippi had no representative in the united states senate after jefferson davis resigned at the beginning of the civil war when mississippi reentered the union in revels was elected as a compromise candidate the memphis daily avalanche of january had this to say about the first negro to serve in the united states senate seven cities contended for the honor of homers birth how many will struggle for revels is yet a question a week ago people had never heard his name or if heard it was only to be forgotten now it will be the subject of leaders and when revels reaches washington the reporters of all the great journals will interview him happy revels he is of popular manners and speaks with great ease in his intercourse with all classes he conducts himself with decorousness that has won him the regard of all his neighbors at home and of the members of the mississippi senate of which he is now a member revels did not go to washington to serve a full fouryear term it was an unexpired term to last from february to march blanche kelso bruce was the first negro to serve a full term as united states senator when senator revels arrived in washington some members of the mississippi delegation held a party president u s grant and his cabinet members were present grant received revels with much kindness and told him he hoped he would be admitted in the senate without difficulty it was reported that even the radicals of the republican party didnt want a negro in congress when revels credentials were presented to the senate on february one senator james nye rejoiced in a speech that a negro was replacing jefferson davis this set off a debate that lasted all day and revels was not confirmed on that daythe debate resumed on february and lasted all day without a decision senator simon cameron made a speech in which he reminded the senate of what he had said in when jefferson davis left washington see earlier reference the radicals wanted to seat revels in davis old seat for the spectacular effect it would create senator ross of kansas the man who broke the tie vote to impeach andrew johnson as recorded in john f kennedys profiles in courage occupied jefferson davis old seat no he would not give it up and revels was forced to take no on the opposite side of the row a vote of to was cast in his favor on february and revels became the first negro to be seated in the united states senate the newspapers and the negro ministers in washington announced that senator revels would give his first speech in the senate on march the gallery of the senate was packed a writer for the philadelphia press said never since the birth of the republic has such an audience been assembled under one single roof it embraces the greatest and the least american citizens the occasion of revels speech was the readmission of georgia into the union in referring to his race revels managed to get in a word for civil liberties they appeal to you and to me to see that they receive that protection which alone will enable them to pursue their daily avocations and enjoy the liberties of citizenship on the same footing with their white neighbors and friends sir i repeat the fact that the colored race saved the noble women of new england and the middle states many men of whom they lean today for security and safety many of my race representatives of these men on the battlefield sleep in countless graves of the south if those quiet resting places of our honored dead could speak today what a mighty voice like to the rushing of a mighty wind would come up from those sepulchral homes could we resist the eloquent pleadings of their appeal ah sir i think that this question of immediate and ample protection for the loyal people of georgia would lose its technicalities and we would cease to hesitate in our provisions for their instant relief senator revels didnt receive any more attention until the summer of at this time he appointed a negro to west point the negro cadet who faced intense harassment failed to pass and was soon dropped the nation of june pronounced it a very foolish and cruel thing as far as the boy and his family were concerned and a very injudicious thing as far as the colored race is concerned the first negro senator introduced two or three minor bills which failed to pass on february revels gave his last speech in the senate it concerned the mixed schools in the district of columbia which he favored at the conclusion of his speech he said the white race has no better friend than i i am true to my own race but at the same time i would not have anything done which would harm the white race senator revels term came to a close on march he did not run for reelection alcorn college for negroes was established in mississippi and revels became its first president he was appointed by governor alcorn who had replaced him on the states senate in june revels went to new orleans to edit the southwestern advocate an organ of the general conference of his church revels then served a second term as president of alcorn college after this he returned to religious work and made his home at holly springs mississippi he became district superintendent of his church and died while attending a church conference at aberdeen mississippi the date was january thus ended the career of the first negro to serve in the united states senate the year was the year that george h white a negro native of north carolina went out of office white was the last negro to serve in congress until so the year will be the terminal point in this paper extensive coverage of the career of hiram r revels is given to set the stage for comment on other negroes to serve in the united states congress we are now familiar with the conditions of the times which vary little with the other united states senator blanche kelso bruce and the or so negro congressmen from to however their personalities and pronouncements were often at variance with revels as we shall see as already stated revels was bom free and served only part of a term march blanche kelso bruce only negro to serve full term in united states senate born a slave at prince edward county virginia as a passing comment what if they had closed their schools in the s instead of in the s they would have lost a united states senator from their county even though he removed to mississippi before he became senator the charge that all negro officers were illiterates ignorant of the science of government cannot be sustained some of them had undergone considerable training and had experienced sufficient mental development to be able to discharge their duties with honor b k bruce was educated at oberlin college this was quite an accomplishment in itself for an exslave allan nevins in writing about reconstruction gives the white mans view of negroes in politics thus the north had gone far beyond the step of merely granting the negro a full participation in the rights and duties of free society it had taken the millions of former slaves almost uni versally unlettered and ignorant the children of the dark continent and the victims of slavery and had placed them in charge of the delicate and complicated mechanism of modern democracy with power to deal with its laws and its courts the men most capable of government the able experienced and welleducated whites whom the south had been wont in prewar days to place in office were rigidly excluded from public affairs i would hope that the great historian allan nevins has grown in his insight of southern white politicians of antebellum days and the reconstruction negro politicians since he wrote the above in the career of blanche k bruce who may have been exceptional will go a little ways in refuting the judgment of professor nevins a couple of quotes from leading historians at the conclusion of this paper should also help to refute the quote of nevins blanche k bruce was the only negro in american history to serve a regular term in the united states senate edward brooke of massachusetts will be number two he was born a slave in prince edward county virginia march his mother had been the slave of a wealthy planter and young bruce was a pet and often said he saw none of the horrors of slavery instead he did as he liked and was educated by a tutor bruce escaped to hannibal missouri there he organized the first school in the country exclusively for negroes after the war he took a special two year course at oberlin college at this point he had more education than andrew jackson andrew johnson and harry truman then he went to mississippi at just the opportune time since there was a good chance there for intelligent and capable men he also found time to engage in planting on a large scale and became wealthy these honors made bruce much more logical a candidate than revels had been he was elected against very weak opposition securing even the votes of three democratic senators bruce was present march when the special session met and he received more attention than anyone except andrew johnson who had just returned to the senate on account of a grudge against ames alcorn the white senator of mississippi did not escort his colleague to the desk to be sworn in bruce was embarrassed but was starting up alone when senator conkling noticed it and accompanied him for this bruce was duly grateful and several years later named his only son roscoe conkling bruce had the courage to vote against the wishes of his white colleagues in the senate when he thought something was wrong in their thinking the majority of the senate in was in favor of the bill to exclude orientals senator bruce came to his feet with the following speech mr president i desire to submit a single remark representing as i do a people who y but a few years ago were considered essentially disqualified from enjoying the privileges and immunities of american citizenship and who have since been so successfully introduced into the body politic and having large confidence in the strength and assimilative power of our institutions i shall vote against the pending bill i dont see many white southern politicians speaking up for democracy in that way at the time may bruce had the unusual experience of presiding over the democratic senate for some time in bruces last session he continued on his same committees but did little else only a few bills were introduced by him and none passed one proposing to buy the freedmans bank property did pass the senate but got no further as his only success he was granted the discarded senate furniture for the use of the home for colored women and children from to the time period of this paper there were only two negro senators so i have been able to give considerable space to their careers to illustrate the type of negro who was serving in the senate however during this time there were negroes who served in the house of representatives therefore i will not use the space to give the careers of all the representatives since hiram r revels a native of north carolina was the first negro to serve in the congress and george h white a native of north carolina was the last negro to serve in the congress during the period of this paper i will go into the career of white to illustrate the type of negro who was serving in the house george white was elected to congress at a time when the south was doing her utmost to disfranchise the negro by this time white served from to even the republican party had turned its back on the negro if reconstruction left its mark on white america it also affected jk black americas political life and means of earning a living reconstruction made the negro a republican as has been noted in the words of frederick douglass the republican party was the deck and all else was the sea a goodly number of negroes became democrats but they had to bear the reproaches of their fellow negroes and sometime even the contempt of whites of their own party just before the turn of the century the nation turned a deaf ear to the negro when the south went into an allout drive to return to precivil war white supremacy president mckinley made no public pronouncement on the big race riot at wilmington n c where negroes were being prevented from voting north carolina passed a constitutional amendment which disfranchised negroes and once again mckinley remained silent dr rayford w logan writes it is appropriate that the last negro congressman of the postreconstruction era completed his term at the end of mckinleys first administration two negroes had been members of the house and one of the senate five had been members of the house and seven from to there had been two negro congressmen in each session from to three and from that time to only one the last of these george h white of north carolina had been elected during the fusionist campaign of and was returned in the election of despite the white supremacy campaignwhich even josephus daniels was to regret in his old age representative george white was among the better negro orators and he was not afraid to speak his mind it is worth noting some things he said in congress in on the day following washingtons birthday he white asked should not a nation be just to all her citizens protect them alike in all their rights on every foot of her soilin a word show herself capable of governing all within her domain before she undertakes to exercise sovereign authority over those of a foreign land should not charity begin at home white was referring to acquisition of territories and peoples after the spanishamerican war of congressman white in one of his best speeches made a fullscale sally upon the breastwords of mob law and lynching we have struggled on as best we could with the odds against us at every turn our constitutional rights have been trodden under foot fully of my race have been ignominously murdered by mobs not percent of whom have been made to answer for their crimes in the courts of justice and even here in the nations capitalin the senate and housesenators and representatives have undertaken the unholy task of extenuating and excusing these foul deeds and in some instances they have gone so far as to justify them the white supremacy people of the south and also many of their white brothers of the north had been used to negroes being seen at the back door and not heard one of the reasons the negro had been accused of being an ignorant and uneducated legislator was not so much his ignorance but the fact that he had not been allowed to speak out so whites statements made the southern white raging mad on february he white quoted on the floor of the house a diatribe in josephus daniels raleigh news and observer one typical sentence read it is bad enough that north carolina should have the only nigger congressman on march both houses of the north carolina legislature noted with speeches of thanksgiving that whites term in the united states congress had ended white had realized that enough negroes had been disfranchised in north carolina and white supremacy had gained strong enough foothold that his reelection would be futile he did not put himself up for reelection when george h white of north carolina the last of the postcivil war congressmen finished his term in he predicted in a moving valedictory that the negro would return his phophecy was fulfilled when oscar de priest of chicago was elected in to the first of three terms samuel d smith author of the negro in congress who rarely found negro members worthy of commendation paid white a mild tribute when he said that the valedictory would have been an excellent one had the note of bitterness not been so strong always in whites estimation the white race was wrong and the negro the innocent victim the speech was a better one than smith was willing to concede in view of the plight of the negro at that time it was relatively restrained in his conclusion white made a prediction that has today been fulfilled the thesis in this paper has been that negro congressmen were most times worthy and fully qualified for their positions so for a conclusion i will quote some reliable people on how they saw the negro congressmen their responsible conduct moved james g blaine their contemporary to observe the colored men who took their seats in both senate and house did not appear ignorant or helpless they were as a rule studious earnest ambitious men whose public conduct would be honorable to any race the africans who came to the united states as slaves started can heritage soon after they arrived in this country they were searching for the lost identity that the slave system has destroyed concurrent with the black mans search for an identity in america has been his search for an identity in the world which means in essence his identity as a human being with a history before and after slavery that can command respect some afroamericans gave up the search and accepted the distorted image of themselves that had been created by their oppressors as early as dr edward wilmot blyden the great west indian scholar and benefactor of west africa addressed himself to this situation when he said in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary school books geographies travels histories having embraced or at least assented to those falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes despite the alienation spoken of here by dr blyden the afroamericans spiritual trek back to africa continued dr w e b du bois the elder statesman among the afroamericans addressed himself to the broader aspects of this situation on the occasion of the celebration of the second anniversary of the asianafrican bandung conference and the rebirth of ghana on april when he said from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries the africans imported to america regarded themselves as temporary settlers destined to return eventually to africa their increasing revolts against the slave system which culminated in the eighteenth century showed a feeling of close kinship to the motherland and even well into the nineteenth century they called their organizations african as witness the african unions of new york and newport and the african churches of philadelphia and new york in the west indies and south america there was even closer indication of feelings of kinship with africa and the east the planters excuse for slavery was advertised as conversion of africa to christianity but soon american slavery appeared based on the huge profits of the sugar empire and the cotton kingdom as plans were laid for the expansion of the slave system the slaves themselves sought freedom by increasing revolt which culminated in the th century in haiti they won autonomy in the united states they fled from the slave states in f t the south to the free states in the north and to canada t here the free negroes helped form the abolition movement and when that seemed to be failing the negroes began to plan for migration to africa haiti and south america civil war and emancipation intervened and american negroes looked forward to becoming free and equal citizens here with no thought of return to africa or of kinship with the worlds darker peoples however the rise of the negro was hindered by disfranchisement lynching and caste legislation there was some recurrence of the back to africa idea and increased sympathy for darker folk who suffered the same sort of caste restrictions as american negroes during the eighteenth century there was strong agitation among certain groups of black people in america for a return to africa this agitation was found mainly among groups of free negroes because of the uncertainty of their position as freedmen in a slaveholding society one can see it late into the eighteenth century dr du bois explains in his book dust of dawn when the negro union of newport rhode island in proposed to the free african society of philadelphia a general exodus to africa on the part of at least free negroes the back to africa idea has been a reoccuring theme in afroamerican life and thought for more than a hundred years this thought was strong during the formative years of the colonization society and succeeded in convincing some of the most outstanding black men of the eighteenth and nineteenth century such as john russwurm the first negro college graduate bowdoin and lott carey the powerful virginia preacher later the society fell into severe disrepute after an argument with the abolitionists two freedom struggles emerged early in the nineteenth century one african one afroamerican while the africans were engaged in their wars against colonialism the american blacks were engaged in slave revolts some slaves took the christian version of the bible seriously and believed that god meant all men to be free such a slave was gabriel prosser of virginia who felt that he was inspired by god to lead his people to freedom over slaves were involved in his revolt of before it was betrayed in in charleston s c a carpenter denmark vesey planned one of the most extensive revolts against slavery ever recorded he too was betrayed and afterwards put to death along with of his followers in the greatest slave revolt of all occurred in virginia led by nat turner a plowman and a preacher whose father had escaped to freedom in joseph cinque the son of a mendi king in sierra leone west africa was sold into slavery and shipped to cuba cinque and his fellow africans revolted on board the ship and ordered the ships owners to sail to africa the spanish owners of the ship steered northward when they were not being watched and eventually landed off the coast of long island the africans were arrested and sent to new haven conn where they were put on trial when the trial began there was great excitement in the country people talked about the case and took sides southern politicians wanted to give the africans back to the spaniards who had bought them the trial lasted all winter in court cinque made a wonderful speech in his own language telling the story of how he and his men had fought to be free after that speech the court ordered the africans set free cinque and his men were sent to school to be educated and were found to be intelligent and quick to learn meanwhile the two spaniards and the spanish government appealed to the united states supreme court to have the africans returned to them as slaves the friends of cinque and his men asked john quincy adams the former president of the united states and a great lawyer to speak for the africans on march j after adams had spoken chief justice taney of the supreme court ruled that cinque and the others were to be freed after that cinque continued his schooling and in he and his men returned to africa all america had been stirred by this case the slave owners feared that the news about the freedom and return to africa of cinque and his fellow africans would cause their slaves to revolt and also demand to be returned to their homeland in the years before the civil war plans for the migration of the free negroes back to africa were revived and agents were sent to south america haiti and africa paul cuffe a free black ship owner from new bedford massachusetts had founded the friendly society for the emigration of free negroes from america and had taken a large number back to africa at his own expense in the middle of the nineteenth century while the issue of slavery was being debated in most of the country the feeling for africa among american blacks was growing stronger publications like freedoms journal and douglass monthly edited by frederick douglass called attention to the plight of the people of africa as well as the black americans i thank god for making me a man simply but delaney always thanks him for making him a black man this spoke frederick douglass of his old friend martin r delaney spokesman physician explorer and scientist martin r delaney was proud of his african background and the mandingo blood that flowed in his veins he was one of the leaders of the great debate following the passage of the fugitive slave act in he was the spokesman for the black people who felt that the bitter racial climate in america had made life for them in this country unbearable delaney was the strongest voice in several conventions of free neuroes to discuss plans for emigrating to africa in he led the first and only exploratory party of americanborn africans to the land of their forefathers in the region of the niger river in the area that became nigeria delaneys party carried out scientific studies and made agreements with several african kings for the settlement of emigrants from america this interest in africa was continued under the leadership of men like rev alexander crummell and bishop henry mcneal turner during the latter part of the nineteenth century edward wilmot blyden a native of what was then the danish west indies called attention to the important role that africa could play in emerging world affairs he was convinced that the only way to bring respect and dignity to his people was by building progressive new empires in africa he was of the opinion that the new world negro has a great future in africa he saw liberia in west africa as the ideal place where africanamericans could build a new and great civilization by making use of the things that they had learned in the west and preserving the best of the african way of life because of his j and the work of many others the african consciousness was translated into useful programs of service to africa afroamerican institutions of higher learning joined in this service through their training of the personnel of the churches as well as their support of africans studying in their institutions the idea of uniting all africa had its greatest development early in this century in a west indian lawyer h sylvester williams called together the first panafrican conference in london this meeting attracted attention and put the word panafrican in the dictionaries for the first time the delegates to the conference came mainly from england the west indies and the united states the small delegation from the united states was led by w e b du bois this meeting had no deep roots in africa itself and the movement and the idea died for a generation then came the first world war at the close of this war w e b du bois led the determined agitation for the rights of african people throughout the world particularly in africa meetings were held and a petition was sent to president wilson who was meeting with other leaders of the western world at the peace congress in versailles dr du bois went to paris with the idea of calling a panafrican congress for the purpose of im pressing upon the members of the peace congress setting in versailles the importance of africa in the future world in spite of being without credentials and influence some attention was paid to the idea president wilsons assistant colonel house was sympathetic but noncommittal the chicago tribune said january in dispatch from paris dated december an ethiopian utopia to be fashioned out of the german colonies is the latest dream of leaders of the negro race who are here at the invitation of the united states government as part of the extensive entourage of the american peace delegation robert r moton successor of the late booker t washington as head of tuskegee institute and dr william e b du bois editor of the crisis are promoting a panafrican conference to be held here during the winter while the peace conference is on full blast it is to embrace negro leaders from america abyssinia liberia haiti and the french and british colonies and other parts of the black world its object is to get out of the peace conference an effort to modernize the dark continent and in the world reconstruction to provide international machinery looking toward the civilization of the african natives the negro leaders are not agreed upon any definite plan but dr du bois has mapped out a scheme which he has presented in the form of memorandum to president wilson it is quite utopian and it has less than a chinamans chance of getting anywhere in the peace conference but it is nevertheless interesting as selfdetermination is one of the words to conjure with in paris nowadays the negro leaders are seeking to have it applied if possible in a measure to their race in africa dr du bois dream is that the peace conference could form an internationalized africa to have as its basis the former german colonies with their square miles and population to this his plan reads could be added by negotiation the square miles and inhabitants of portuguese africa it is not impossible that belgium could be persuaded to add to such a state the square miles and natives of the congo making an international africa with over square miles of land and over people this africa for the africans could be under the guidance of international organization the governing international commission should represent not simply governments but modem culture science commerce social reform and religious philanthropy it must represent not simply the white world but the civilized negro world with these two principles the practical policies to be followed out in the government of the new states should involve a thorough and complete system of modern education built upon the present government religion and customary law of the churches within ten years black children ought to be in school within a generation young africa should know the essential outlines of modern culture from the beginning the actual general government should use both coloured and white officials w e b du bois wrote extensively about the idea of panafricanism and the world unity of people of african descent this is the essence of his statement on the intent of the panafrican congress of this congress represented africa partially of the delegates from fifteen countries nine were african countries with delegates the other delegates came from the united states which sent and the west indies with most of these delegates did not come to france for this meeting but happened to be residing there mainly for reasons connected with the war america and all the colonial powers refused to issue special visas the congress influenced the peace conference the new york evening globe february nd described it as the first assembly of the kind in history and has for its object the drafting of an appeal to the peace conference to give the negro race of africa a chance to develop unhindered by other races seated at long green tables in the council room today were negroes in the trim uniform of american army officers other american coloured men in frock coats or business suits polished french negroes who hold public office senegalese who sit in the french chamber of deputies the congress specifically asked that the german colonies be turned over to an international organization instead of being handled by the various colonial powers out of this idea came the mandates commission the resolution of the congress said in part a that the allied and associated powers establish a code of law for the international protection of the natives of africa similar to the proposed international code for labor b that the league of nations establish a permanent bureau charged with the special duty of overseeing the application of these laws to the political social and economic welfare of the natives c the negroes of the world demand that hereafter the natives of africa and the peoples of african descent be governed according to the following principles the land and its natural resources shall be held in trust for the natives and at all times they shall have effective ownership of as much land as they can profitably develop capital the investment of capital and granting of concessions shall be so regulated as to prevent the exploitation of the natives and the exhaustion of the natural wealth of the country concessions shall always be limited in time and subject to state control the growing social needs of the natives must be regarded and the profits taxed for social and material benefit of the natives labor slavery and corporal punishment shall be abolished and forced labor except in punishment for crime and the general conditions of labor shall be prescribed and regulated by the state education it shall be the right of every native child to learn to read and write his own language and the language of the trustee nation at public expense and to be given technical instruction in some branch of industry the state shall also educate as large a number of natives as possible in higher technical and cultural training and maintain a corps of native teachers the state the natives of africa must have the right to participate in the government as far as their development permits in conformity with the principle that the government exists for the natives and not the natives for the government they shall at once be allowed to participate in local and tribal government according to ancient usage and this participation shall gradually extend as education and experience proceeds to the higher offices of state to the end that in time africa be ruled by consent of the africans whenever it is proven that african natives are not receiving just treatment at the hands of any state or that any state deliberately excludes its civilized citizens or subjects of negro descent from its body politic and cultural it shall be the duty of the league of nations to bring the matter to the civilized world the idea of panafrica having thus been established dr du bois now attempted to build a real organization the panafrica movement began to represent growth and development soon the du bois approach to panafricanism was challenged by the approach of marcus garvey the national association for the advancement of colored people began its interest in africa with support of the various panafrican congresses called by dr du bois the african and afroamerican freedom struggle that had met and joined forces briefly in the nineteenth century was now meeting again in the twentieth century two great personalities were bringing the message of africas awakening to the worlds attention both of them were saying in different ways that africa was great once and will be great again both of them told the afroamericans that they had a part to play in africas redemption the two personalities were w e b dubois and marcus garvey the italianethiopian war renewed interest in africa this interest sustained and was increased when in the gold coast gained its independence and took back its ancient nameghana black american grassroots identification with african problems burst upon the international scene during the first congo crisis when a group of black nationalists created a disturbance in the galleries of the united nations in protest against alleged u n connivance in the murder of patrice lumumba this identification with african political affairs amongst the black masses reached its zenith with the visit to africa by malcolm_x shortly before his death and his effort to enlist the support of the organization of african unity this growing interest in africa and a rediscovery of the lost african heritage launched the spread of black consciousness among young civil_rights militants out of this feeling the concept of black_power was bom he tend to read history t os not our ey es ut tv r with our prejudices so y said wendell phillips more than a century ago in his eulogy on toussaint louverture the black liberator of haiti phillips did not live to see the day of unprejudiced history for he died in when carter g woodson had not yet reached his teens but thanks to woodson who in began to resurrect the negro past succeeding generations of americans would increasingly begin to read history with their eyes the result is that today we are witnessing somewhat of a boom in negro history a boom which shows no signs of abating the movement grows apace to make our countrys history less white and more american today as never before there is a mounting realization that not all colored folks were picking cotton in the southland before or after appomattox in the words of herbert hill this increasing interest in the historical negro embraces all manner of menthe scholar in his study the teacher in the classroom the parent in the home and the negro masses who have come to have a new image of themselves the larger general public has not been immune to this revitalized study of the negro past to the idea that the negro has been a mover and shaker in our history if negro history is here to stay one of the reasons is the behavior of the presentday negro the current civil_rights revolution has brought with it a heightened interest in the negros role in the american past within the negro community itself there has been a growing pride in the negro heritage a sentiment shared alike by the rank and file and the talented tenth of w e b du bois negroes who are no longer ashamed of their skin color or hair texture are not likely to be ashamed of their past proud acceptance of ones self makes for proud acceptance of ones past reflecting this spirit some civil_rights groups have brought out brief negro histories realizing the importance of supplying the missing pages from the agenda of the past negro history looms large in the portfolio of the freedom movement indeed a basic premise of the freedom schools was that our nations history was by no means the creation of whites only another grassroots effort that may be noted is the establishing of negro history museums often under the leadership of writers artists or teachers negro parent groups have been active particularly in urging school boards to bestir themselves these parents have called for a better portrayal of the negro in the history textbooks and in other teaching materials in some instances this effort has been supported by farseeing white parents who wish to bring their children up without prejudice and who realize that prejudice feeds upon ignorance and distorted information school boards in our big cities seem to have got the message they have scrutinized history textbooks more carefully making sure that the negro is seen in proper perspective some school systems have revised their course outlines in the social studies to include negrorelated materials in new york city the board of education has set up a human relations unit designed to promote better schoolcommunity feeling one of the units most helpful publications has been a page mimeographed pamphlet on the negro in american history a number of other school systems likewise have prepared special negro history booklets and guides some city systems have set up negro history workshops designed for social studies teachers primarily but open to others that the nature of american history is changing is recognized by the testing services that construct examinations for entrance into college and for job placement increasingly the examinations constructed by these agencies will have essay and multiple choice questions relating to the negro predictably the first negroes to appear in these tests may be nonmilitants like phillis wheatley and george washington carver but inevitably frederick douglass harriet tubman and w e b du bois will appear and who knows one day malcolm_x and the black_power dissidents may even make their appearance in higher education it is to be noted that some colleges and graduate schools are for the first time scheduling courses in negro history a number of other such institutions are seeking fulltime professors of african history and negro american history the world of business has become aware of negro history last spring the wall street journal carried a frontpagearticle entitled the black past written by a staff reporter peter h prugh its opening lines ran like this the list of titles published by the book companies reflects this increase of interest in the negro and for the childrens market we may expect negro history coloring books possibly bearing the title color me colored for children too a negro history game of the old maid type has made its appearance in this game there are picture cards consisting of pairs of pictures of such worthies as crispus attucks prince hall and john b russwurm there is a single card labeled uncle tom de picting an oldster with a hangdog expression and the player who winds up with this card loses the game big business firms have sensed that negro history is good public relations one firm for example has brought out for free distribution a travelers guide to negro history another firm has brought out a booklet about notable negro women of the past and still another has produced a negro history cartoon book negro history has been found of use to our countrys policymakers the national advisory commission on civil disorders as it began its hearings in september devoted an entire afternoon to an examination of the negros past in america men in political life are coming to realize the importance of knowing something about the historical negro no politician it has been said can win a major office in america without first getting right with lincoln but humor aside candidates for public office in our major cities may find it important to have at least a bowing acquaintance with a few negro heroes past as well as present especially those of local derivation a major and final reason for the promising future of negro history is that it has attracted the attention of the world of scholarship historians can perform no service more useful to society writes j g randall than to expose faulty or vicious generalizations about history that continue to mislead mankind and historians have come to realize that one of the aspects of history about which people have been badly informed up to now has been the role of the negro for the historians are finding him in whatever phase of the american past they choose to focus upon be it exploration war government invention culture or sports the depth of the negros involvement in our history is suggested in earle e thorpes observation slight the negro in studies or theories on southern history and the truth is always missed another presentday historian wesley frank craven in his the legend of the founding fathers expresses the same thought in the form of a question who among us can wander down the streets of williamsburg with promptings on every side to remember washington and jefferson and still remember that it all rested originally upon the back of a negro in history circles the current stress on urban history will certainly bring the negro more to the fore scholars are now paying much more attention than ever before to the rise of cities in america and their profound impact on our national life in such studies it will hardly be possible to bypass the negro who since the turn of the century has become increasingly an urban dweller a proportion rising from onequarter in to threequarters today in addition to including the negro in general portrayals of city life writers of history have been turning out books in which the urban negro is the central character such works include richard wades study of slavery in the cities of the south gilbert osofskys description of harlem from to and allen h spears treatment of black chicago covering much the same period from the pages of these writers we are learning that many of the problems faced by the urban negro stemmed from his role as a newcomer hence to view the urban negro as a man seeking to make an adjustment in a new environment would seem to be a sounder explanation of his experience than to view him as some have done as the product of a broken unstable family or as having some other deeply ingrained folk pattern peculiar to americans of color another phase of the past that is undergoing significant historical revision is the history of africa before columbus the ancestral homelands of the negro american are now undergoing historical redefinition making use of newer nontraditional techniques researchers are providing more and more information on early africa and when the dark continent is seen in its true light the history of the west coast peoples who were transplanted to the new world the afroamericans will likewise be illumined the upsurge of scholarly interest in negro american history is clearly revealed by the number of articles now being written about it the number of scholars who read papers at the recent annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history is but a portion of those who had expressed a willingness to appear the number of learned papers being produced far outruns the publication capacity of the journal of negro history plus the other negroedited quarterlies phylon and the journal of negro education happily the other learned periodicals are publishing negro articles more and more one of the hurdles facing the researcher in negro history is a lack of readily accessible information happily here too there are signs of change the ford foundation for example has established a civil_rights documentation project whose aim is to collect information on the civil_rights movement of our times this body of data including oral history and unpublished material will be made available to future researchers the chairman of the ford committee is ralphe j bunche its members include margaret mead and john hope franklin and its director is vincent j browne another significant project designed to aid scholars is the editing of the voluminous papers of booker t washington this undertaking is headed by louis r harlan under the sponsorship of the university of maryland and launched by an initial grant from the national endowment for the humanities in time the scholarly study of the negro should profit from the relatively new warren center for the study of the history of liberty in america located at harvard the center is headed by oscar handlin author of firebell in the night a work bearing the explanatory subtitle the crisis in civil_rights the work of the historical guild is worth noting because its output is likely to be based upon the best knowledge available at the time the professionallyminded historian is wedded to the idea that truth is the whole he seeks better history better often because more inclusive inevitably this better history will reflect the viewpoint that the negro has been a protagonist of significant historical action time out of mind and this fact the true historian would not wish to ignore for in his search for the significant past he welcomes such a fresh element of vitality his vision thus enlarged the historian may then with due modesty proceed to fashion his small footnote to the vast repository of the written word black resistance in colonial haiti haiti was called st domingue when it was a french colony from about to the s when the slaves revolted abolished slavery and wrested their independence st domingue was frances most valuable colony france became wealthy and powerful by engaging in the slave trade and by shipping processing and selling on the european market the sugar coffee and other products produced by the slaves of st domingue the haitian revolution led by toussaint louverture was the only successful slave revolt in history and the first successful independence movement in latin america governments like to give the impression that they are allpowerful the policy makers know better there arent enough police there arent enough soldiers to control a people which does not recognize the authority of the government and organizes effectively against it this is true in south vietnam today it was true in colonial haiti governments must mystify their subjects with symbols of authority with brainwashing religions and with bribes and threats to keep the people divided the people must largely accept the values of the government or there can be no real stability force alone is never enough french control in st domingue was always weak because the slaves created their own institutions for coping with slavery the official documents of the french colonial administration tell us something about the avenues of freedom which the slaves managed to open up even under slavery the market was very important to the economic social and religious life of west africa and the slaves skilled in buying and selling controlled the internal market of the colony the french colonists depended upon the slaveoperated markets to trade goods within the colony especially to provide the cities and towns with food the market was held on sundays and holidays and the noise interfered with religious services but the colonial authorities had to recognize that the colony depended upon these slaveoperated markets the famous code noir black code of outlawed the slaveoperated markets but the french colonists protested that they were absolutely necessary to the commerce of the colony and the french government changed the law the next year and allowed the slaveoperated markets to continue the code noir of denied all property rights to slaves article said the west african brought with him his own ideas about property which were not as clearcut as those of the french in dahomey which had the greatest cultural influence in haiti everything belonged in theory to the king land horses implements slaves money even the person of the subject but no king would dare claim his rights out of fear of the ancestors there were two other types of property one was the property of the sib or the extended family it was owned collectively and administered by the oldest male member of the sib the other was private property which could be held by men or women it included houses built trees planted regardless on whose land money earned produce of labor utensils guns mats pipes and magic charms consisting often of herbs and medicines discovered by hunters in the forest who then could sell the formula to others there were complex rules for inheritance of personal property the slaves never accepted the french ideas about property and used their control of the internal market to buy freedom for themselves and their fellow slaves from the french point of view it was wholesale theft and dealing on the black market and they passed many laws to try to curb these operations they required slaves to have a written permit from their masters authorizing them to sell certain things anyone buying goods from a slave without a permit from his master was subject to fine imprisonment and even corporal punishment slaves were forbidden to sell sugar cane even with the masters permission it was hard to enforce pass laws because most of the french colonists were illiterate the colonial administration could never control the black market some of the documents describe how it operated one document complains that the slaves were stealing indigo and other merchandise which was easy to carry and selling to black market operators traveling from plantation to plantation and this trade was thriving so much that the public markets were poorly attended another document describes the operations of the black market another way for the slaves to get money was monopoly price fixing especially of food sold in the cities and towns another document complains that there were was motivated by the desire for freedom and they tried to control the black market by forbidding masters to free their slaves in return for money explaining why emancipation without government consent were being outlawed they said most of the disorders that occur in the french islands among the slaves come from the facility which the colonists have of giving them freedom in return for sums of money which they agree upon with their said slaves some even abandon the service of their masters engaging in private affairs under the pretext of working by the day in return for a small recompense which they promise to their said masters others abandon themselves to all kinds of vices to amass the sums agreed upon getting together and carrying on their commerce in the houses of those who have already been freed most of them having cabarets even among whites who are low enough to receive them day and night traffic with them and suffer their infamous and immodest commerce and this is very common in spite of the ordonnances and the prohibitions already made published and posted but this did not help and laws continued to be passed throughout the colonial period to try to control theft and the black market flight was an even more effective means of organized resistance the slaves ran away to the spanish part of the island where they were safe and to colonies of runaway slaves called marons up in the mountains they built towns cultivated the soil raided the plantations and defended themselves from assault by the french they sent messengers to the plantations to encourage other slaves to escape the french authorities knew that the marons were a serious threat to french rule emilien petit a member of the conseils superieurs des colonies wrote in a colony which has the misfortune to have to fear establishments of slave deserters enters from that moment into a state of war the danger of which can only increase with time documents show that in spite of the brutal penalties passed for flight the french could not control the situation in march we read the island finding itself devastated by fugitive slaves the council orders that we negotiate with francisque slave of mr fabulet and leader of a large band the conditions of this treaty are that francisque will have his freedom and a thousand pounds of tobacco and that no punishment be inflicted upon the members of his band from there is a large number of fugitive slaves who have committed several disorders and violences taking cattle stealing food crops and kidnapping even people passing along the highways and we have learned that these negroes live in common in the woods where they have plantations under cultivation houses built and food planted rewards were offered for the capture of fugitive slaves mutilation of he leg and even death become penalties for flight raiding parties were organized against the maron colonies in we read that the divers raid which we have ordered against the marons negroes have not had the success that was expected and larger detachments are ordered into the field masters are told that slaves found off their property without a pass will be shot on sight but the fugitive slave colonies continued to grow and prosper in we hear the following complaint escaped slaves have a way of getting together in the woods and living there exempt from service to their masters under leaders whom they elect among themselves others hiding themselves in the canefields during the day await the night to rob passersby on the highways and go from plantation to plantation taking cattle which they find to eat or hide themselves in the cabins of their comrades who ordinarily participate in their thefts knowing what goes on in their masters house and advising the said fugitive slaves so that they can take their measures for the said thefts without being noticed by we hear of mass desertions the number of slaves who have become marons for the past few years and especially during the war is excessive because of their libertinage they leave in bands and desert to the foreigners with whom we were at war so that several of the colonists have had the misfortune of seeing themselves deprived of the cultivation of their lands and reduced to seeking the help of their friends to provide for their families and it is certain that in none of the neighborhoods the enemy has not taken so many as those who have given themselves of voluntarily and that a great number who remain do so only for the return of some and the desertion of others from the island in a militia is organized to cope with the disorders of the maron negroes which increase every day in the neighborhood of cap and cause great prejudice by the establishments they make in the mountains obliging us to search all means to destroy them and procure to the colonists tranquility in their work and security in their neighborhoods m m m r in the marechausee a permanent body of troops to fight the marons was first organized the reason the negro slaves desert every day with arms and horses and everything they can steal from their masters or from other colonists and even join together in large numbers to be in condition to defend themselves if anyone attempts to stop them and it has already happened several times that thus assembled or alone armed or unarmed they leave from all over the island and go to the spaniards where they are perfectly well received and from where it is impossible to get them back and the news of this favorable reception from the spaniards has spread among the rest either through spanish agents or by means of the negroes themselves sent back to foment desertion this reception has made in their minds an impression which tends towards a general revolt and by consequence the total ruin of the colonists of cap and even the loss of the entire colony in their desperation the administrators became more savage the heads of negroes shot were to be exposed upon pikes any colonist could shoot and kill any negro who he met at night who refuses to stop when first commanded to do so masters were to keep all arms and munitions under lock and key spaniards entering the colony were warned not to speak to nor have any kind of business with any slave under penalty of being thrown into jail at once prices were put on the heads of certain leaders of fugitive slaves in a price was put on the head of a slave named noel who has assembled a considerable number of slaves around him notably several foremen of different slave gangs and he has succeeded in so frightening the colored people that they no longer dare present themselves before him the colonial authorities committed mass tortures and executions in public to terrorize the slaves there are many examples this is only one it is a judgment against slaves men and women blacks and mulattoes hand cut off before the church drawn and quartered by four horses this done their members thrown into the fire and their ashes into the wind and their heads exposed on pikes planted across from the cabaret where the assassination was committed the said accused first to be subjected to interrogation under ordinary and extraordinary torture the executioner was a slave who had been condemned to death and was offered his life in return for being what was euphemistically called the executioner des hautes oeuvres the executioner of exalted works moreau de stmery said that several slaves when offered this choice preferred death the executioner was not very popular and upon at least one occasion the population got its revenge a document dating from tells us that on the occasion of the execution of the sentence of death against d the condemned escaped and the executioner was murdered in the town square by the outraged crowd and in its impotent rage the authorities forbade all persons of whatever quality or condition they may be to interfere with the executions of justice by excesses violences and emotions directly or indirectly under penalty of being pursued extraordinarily but they never found a culprit to pin the blame on all over the americas slaveholding nations tried to detach the slaves from their tribal gods they outlawed certain dances the beating of drums slave priests and herb doctors the possession of fetishes music at funerals and sometimes even marriage and funeral ceremonies in the spanish colonies where the slave population was relatively thin conversion to catholicism and education in that faith was considered the best way of controlling the slaves the french tried that in st domingue but it didnt work the slaves selected what they wanted from catholicism but continued to use their tribal gods to subvert the social order melville herskovits said in africa the conquest of one people by another meant the mutual interchange of acceptance of the respective deities the conquerors added to their own pantheons the gods of those whom they had conquered so that these forces might not wreak a supernatural vengeance upon them while to the conquered the power of the gods of those who had defeated them was selfevident this willingness to accept other gods indicates a flexibility which the french did not possess in other respects as well the west african tradition gave the slaves extraordinary psychological strength dahomean myths stress astuteness in the face of great power maintaining a sense of humor not judging by appearances realism in all relationships discretion in speech resiliency in social situations taking steps to meet problems forseen the west african is not a fatalist herskovits said neither gods nor men are pawns in an allordering system where individuals are endowed with supernatural powers they derive these from spiritual helpers who respond when they are called on but the individual is not moved like a marionette by these powers the slaves of st domingue were to use a current cliche highly motivated and sometimes the french came to believe in the occult powers of their slaves some masters believing that their slaves were sorcerers burned them alive or killed them by breaking their bones with clubs or hammers we quote a judgment against colas jambes coupees legless colas known for his maronages to the spanish seducing and carrying off other slaves leader of an armed band highway robber in broad daylight as well as at night attacking even whites having several intelligences and secret correspondences to abolish the colonies instigator or accomplice in the gangs of cezar jupiter louis and cheri all of whom were punished with extreme torture and death accused furthermore of sorcery and magic for having a number of times escaped from irons and prisons and having poisoned several negroes and since all his crimes and his life are known all over the area and by everyone in the most minute detail the judgment calls for his prompt torture and execution before he escapes again drugs herbs and poisons were used on a grand scale by the slaves who knew more about these matters than did the authorities emilien petit suggested that slaves be given their freedom who have denounced and procured the discovery of unknown poisons and made possible the arrest and punishment of the authors promoters and accomplices of these unknown poisonings because of the loss of a great number of whites slaves and cattle dead of poisoning before one had often before one could have discovered the manner or the authors of these crimes and because of the danger of communicating this secret from one area to another the most widespread conspiracy using poison as its major weapon was the one masterminded by macandal who was burned alive by the authorities in the judgment against him convicted him of rendering himself feared among the negroes and corrupting and seducing them through his prestige and inducing them to commit impieties and profanations to which he delivered himself as well in mixing sacred things in the composition and use of packets pretended to be magic and tending towards evil deeds which he made and sold to negroes and having furthermore composed sold and distributed all types of poisons they were especially shocked because macandal used incense holy water and small crucifixes as well as herbes and poisons in the fetishes he sold after the macandal conspiracy the french colonists seemed to have lost all enthusiasm for converting the slaves to catholicism they passed the following law all colonists are forbidden to allow the superstitutious assemblies and ceremonies which certain slaves are accustomed to hold at the death of one among them and which they improperly call prayers all freedmen and slaves are forbidden to compose sell distribute or buy fetishes or macandals so fearful did the colonists become of assemblies of slaves that the use of christian churches by them was severely restricted in spite of the protests of the jesuit missionaries claiming that the temples of god have become the temporary refuge of fugitive slaves and serve often as a theatre of prostitution the authorities ordered all churches closed to slaves after sundown and between noon and pm no religious offices even minor ones could be held by slaves to protect the security of the colony no slave free black or mulatto could preach either in towns or in the countryside the slaves of st domingue resisted fiercely because it was a matter of life or death they had to be lucky to survive conditions in the slavetrading ships and pens they had to be even luckier to survive conditions on the plantations especially on the sugar plantations during the grinding season which lasted seven or eight months out of the year the slaves were driven day and night with only a few hours to sleep they were so overworked that pere labat an expert on how to run a sugar plantation advised planters to keep a long sharp knife near the canegrinding machines to cut off the arms of slaves who fell asleep and got their fingers caught in the grinders since the machines could not be stopped in time and the slave would be pulled through the grinders only his head falling off slaves should be forced to sing to stay awake so they would not fall into the boiling cauldrons of syrup the slaves were always hungry and neglected when they were sick because the planters believed it was more profitable to work a slave to death and then buy a new one instead of going to the expense of giving him food rest and medical attention the average working life of a slave was seven years french slave law held that a master could punish his slave only by giving him up to blows with a switch or a rope but there is one case of a master who murdered over of his slaves some by what was called total mutilation the master was fined and allowed to keep the rest of his slaves masters tortured and burned alive their slaves suspected of being poisoners forcing them to reveal the names of their accomplices real or imaginary who were in turn tortured and burned alive the slaves were faced with cold calculated conscienceless exploitation and an early grave a fate not very different from that of black youth in our ghettoes today only the form is different no one sees no one knows but death is the great dissolver of irrelevancies the slaves of st domingue were able to resist effectively and finally win their freedom when the right moment came because they never accepted the values of the white colonists and because the black underworld played a largely protective role towards the black community it exploited the white community for the benefit of the black in the united states today it works the other way around the black underworld exploits the black community for the benefit of the white underworld maybe because the black underworld is too attached to the symbols of success and worthiness held by the white world to use its extraordinary talents for the benefit of the black community if you have not read the novel the confessions of nat turner random house by william styron before you do i suggest you read thomas greys confessions of nat turner in which nat turner a negro slave describes in schizophrenic eloquence how he and a few other slaves massacred whites in an abortive attempt to rid this country of slavery now with the rhythm of nats own account reverberating in your head try to guess answers to this question what really was behind this mans thinking or what made this coon behave so badly after all we did for him if you guess that he had an extremely liberal master who like frankenstein created a monster by educating him and whose family treated him like one of them that his revolutionary drive is traceable back to his sexual fantasies about the great white woman which he mistook for the divine spirit that he was a priggish pampered and wellfed houseboy who loathed field niggers then your guesses coincide with what mr styron believes went on inside nat turner in the name of fiction mr styron can do whatever he likes with history when his interpretation however duplicates what is white americas favorite fantasy ie every black maleespecially the leaderis motivated by a latent desire to sleep with the great white woman he is obligated to explain in the structure of the novel of course this coincidental duplicationor to be criticized accordingly since there is no such explanation in the technique of the novel and since it offers no vision or new perspective but rather reaffirms an old stale shameful fantasy which is still quite saleable it is at best a good commercial novel and mr styron is certain to get movie rights out of it it has been said and i think it is true that ones enjoyment of the novel will depend in part on his view of civil_rights the book does have a strange kind of contemporaneity about it it is not for example nat turners repressed obsession for the white woman margaret whitehead that is so appallingly familar but styrons own compulsive persistence in believing that this really is nats obsession thus the novel is not so much about a black slave in a white world as it is about a contemporary white novelist engulfed in a black one it is not so much about the existential predicament of a condemned man as styron declares in the new york times oct as it is about styrons own attempt to explain to himself the origin and destiny of the black world he sees around him every single day and in this sense the mind of the man before us is not nat turners but william styrons someone who has not experienced or felt a thing has to have it explained to him in this i think is the key to this novel and its author as emotional inheritors to slavery few negroes need an explanation of what it was like there are some people who are not so fortunate mr styron for example tells us oct the new york times how for many years he was haunted by the subject of slavery read also his essay this quiet dust harper april after a number years of reading everything he could find on the subject mr styron could explain slavery to himself and to anybody who needed an explanation but he was not finished until he had created a character who could explain it all back to him his version of nat consequently is that of an extraordinarily logical explainer this version of nat turner as a rational sensitive houseboy makes it difficult to believe he could have pulled off such a gutsy revolt and styrons decision to put the story entirely in the mouth of his hero is a structural error since we never know who is doing the talking nat or styron until the contemporary cliches force us to decide in favor of styron rational sensitive and with a good grip on the american class scheme styrons nat finds the field niggers disdainful and avoids them whenever possible in using the outhouse for example he avoided the morning rush training my bowels to obey a later call when i can enjoy some privacy why is it necessary for a major white american novelist to insist upon creating a nat turner who avoids his own people could it be that styron is trying to make his character plausible and for whom white middle class america maybe in stressing the logical rational side of nat styron ignored the emotional irrational schizophrenic charismatic powers of a man who for all who knew him was a witch doctor magician shaman and prophet these powers relate nat directly to the tribal preliterate society of africa in which the leader had to prove by extraordinary feats and prophetic visions that he was indeed possessed of the sacred mana no doubt this tradition tempered nats version of christianity he was not as styron invents the grandson but the first born of a spirited african girl who was literally just off the boat in order to be known to native blacks as a witchehman one had to possess at birth both physical peculiarities like a whopplejaw a harelip crooked or bowed legs one eye like fire and the other eye dead and uncommon intelligence in his actual confession recorded at the time of his trial nat says that he was thought by his father and mother to be intended for some great purpose because of certain marks on my head and breast and of his unnatural mental peculiarity he relates this incident when three or four years old i was telling them children with whom he was playing something which my mother overhearing said it had happened before i was borni stuck by my story however and related some things which went in her opinion to confirm itothers being called on were greatly astonished knowing that these things had happened and caused them to say in my hearing i surely would be a prophet nat convinced many others of his charismatic powers but he seemed to have been his own greatest believer this selfadmiration is best noted in his description of how he learned to read the manner in which i learned to read and write not only had great influence on my mind as i acquired it with the most perfect ease so much so that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet but to the astonishment of the family one day when a book was shown me to keep me from crying i began spelling the names of different objectsthis was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood particularly the blacks unlike john browns histrionics at his own trial nats confessions represent the real man throughout his confessions nat contemplates himself simultaneously as subject and object this schizophrenic view of oneself seems to be the natural results of a black man having to make do in a white world as leroi jones expresses it the negro could not ever become white and that was his strength at some point always he could not participate in the dominant tenor of the white mans culture yet he came to understand that culture as well as the white man it was at this juncture that he had to make use of other resources whether african subcultural or hermetic and it was this boundary this nomansland that provided the logic and beauty of his music styrons nat turner lives not in nomansland where actually he did live and black people are still living but in mr styrons white america where a white woman and a book are so symbolic of what poor nat thinks he needs that he fevers with insupportable excitement that i can feel a loosening in by bowels really although it gives more insight into turners apocalyptic disturbed and irrational mind than any single part of styrons novel nats own account of his education quoted above styron ignores when nat in the actual confession talked of his education he was really talking about himself his feelings his grandiose ideas etc but when styron comes to describe nats education he abandons nats account of his education for his own invented version he seems to suggest that nat revolted against the slavery of his people because of his education and not because of his sense of humanity provoked by identification with that group styron therefore replaces nats account of his education with what reads like a scene from up from slavery a la mode walt disney burning with the desire to be educated this little black boy spends his free time in his masters cellar learning the labels on barrels of sugar saltpeter etc then one day he gets up a lot of nerve and steals a book quite a noble fellow he is caught but instead of being punished he is assured by his liberal master that he will certainly learn to read after all styron says part of his intent was not to shirk what must have been after all the tolerable aspects of the situation ie slavery styrons nat turner is also a victim of his creators theories of revolutionary heroes in an interview styron said nat like most revolutionaries was basically puritanical and this is the reason that in the book he nat turner never had a sexual experience directly with a woman he has an adolescent homosexual experience quite innocent beyond that turner lived a sexual life of fantasy fantasies of women mainly white women which in turn led to imagined revelations and then finally to what turner supposed were revelations from the divine spirit new york times oct can we account for a caesar an alexander martin luther mao jefferson there is no real distinction between a born leader and a revolutionary leader it all depends on what side you are on by this theory and if not why foist it off on nat it is my guess that nat turners revolt cannot be explained by a theory it can only be felt possibly through art styrons book is too fettered by contemporary cliches to approach art he cannot begin to use his emotions because he has paralyzed them with his fantastic analytical ability to explain everything styron denies of course contemporary parallels in the book the central meaning of the book is not consciously contemporary because he began the book and was concerned with the subject back in the fortiesas though the negro problem just moved on the scene in the last years if a novel has new information the overshadowing of the artistic and aesthetic intents by the contemporary parallels may be justified but styron has nothing new to say what he says has been said over and over and believed by far too many in his views on the negro he only differs from the infamous enemy of the negro movement the liberal in using history as a buttress for his ideas styrons nat finally is a super conformist not only does he adopt white mannerisms and parrots their linguistic rhythms but if the truth be told he wishes he were white and the reviewer who said styrons nat turner was negro only in physical aspect is right styrons nat is telling the reader constantly that he is just like any other american yet only middle class america is convinced that any black man least of all a nat turner is an american like anybody else on this point leroi jones has said the negro as he exists in america now and has always existed in this place certainly after formal slavery is a natural nonconformist being black in a society where such a state is an extreme liability is the most extreme form of nonconformity available the vantage point of being both outside and inside at the same time connects the black writer with america in a way the white writer can never be connected to his country in the writings of w e b du bois e franklin frazier james weldon johnson richard wright james baldwin ralph ellison and leroi jones we have proof of this william faulkner was very wise in believing he could never imagine himself as a negro this is not to suggest that mr styron tried to be a negro and failed what i am saying is that there is the dark side of nat turner which mr styron never shows us he shows us not a black nat but a white nat at best a colored one in a white worldcecil m brown the pitman publishing corporation e th street new york n y has come up with an attractive and highly informative addition to the growing body of literature on the black mans role in american historv in eyewitness the negro in american history by william l katz the publishers offer a big book vhxvi inches pages full of fascinating and often unfamiliar facts and illustrated handsomely and with profusion the books contents are divided into fourteen sections beginning with the opening of new worlds and ending with americas civil_rights revolution plus a preface by mr katz and an index the nononsense tone of the book is set in the very first sentences to wit for all who came to these shores america was a land of freedom hope and opportunity for allexcept the negro he came in chains and for hundreds of years had to fight just to be free mr katz method which is used in another important book published a few months ago is to let history speak for itselfthrough the words and the actions of those who were present ator participants inthe historical events the african slave trade for example is described by george w carleton in the suppressed book about slavery which was published in such obscure black patriots and adventurers as salem poor and james armistead heroes of the american revolution are brought up front and some fresh light is cast on the close relationship between black men and red men in the territory of florida when that semitropical area was in the possession of spain there are rundowns on the familiar black explorers and inventorsjames beckwourth george bush benjamin bannekerand cameos on less well known innovators such as norbert rillieux of new orleans who in revolutionized the sugar refining industry in europe and america with his invention of an evaporating pan eyewitness is not without its intentional ironic humor one of the fabulous pieces in the book is a reprint of a learned paper by a perfectly respectable medical doctor at the university of louisiana who in held forth in a most scholarly manner on two diseases indigenous to black men the diseasesdrapetomania or the disease causing negroes to run away from slavery and dysaethesia aethiopica which overseers called simply rascality and which it turned out was the blacks habit of unintentionally through stupidity and clumsiness of course breaking and destroying valuable property belonging to the slaveholders the book is rich in documentation examples of which space does not permit more listing mr katz indicates in his preface that he has been in the process one way or other of producing his book since his high school days its comprehensiveness speaks of such tenacity and concern he now teaches american history at woodlands high school in hartsdale n y and is a member of the westchester county curriculum committee the westchester county people are fortunatehwf all right to begin with it is expensivebut it is also very rare and even more special there has never been anything quite like it made available to the general bookbuying public and it very possibly will never be made available again in this edition what is itit is ethiopian painting a collection of color reproductions and photographs of the art of ancient abyssinia from the late middle ages and during the gondar dynasty arranged by jules leroy and published by frederick a praeger in his preface to this grand volume m leroy points out that ethiopia is usually conspicuously absent from histories of art both general histories and those which are concerned specifically with african works of art any reference that does occur is very limited and bears no relation to the actual significance of the subject he says the book sets out to indicate just how significant ethiopian art has been particularly in the area of coptic christian representations the story of ethiopian painting is closely allied to that of the countrys political and religious development the author states it mirrors ethiopias various links with the outside world and the influences which these contacts have had upon her cultural development it is m leroys bias to explain ethiopias glories and her unique culture almost wholly in the light of the countrys christian history but that can easily be overlooked in reading and absorbing the capsule report on the ethiopian past which m leroy provides certainly many of the paintings shown in the book are close in style and technique to those of a contemporary period in europe but the most fascinating specimens are those stamped with that special flavor which is neither european nor african nor even suggestive of the familiar art of neighboring egypt but oriental some are strongly reminiscent of ancient chinese tapestries but it has to be accepted that they nevertheless are distinctly ethiopian m leroys text is solid intensive and instructive and it would be useful as an essay on ethiopian art and history even without the elaborate illustrations which incidentally must have been set on the pages by hand there are keys to the various plates indicating their location whether in churches or ecclesiastical buildings in ethiopia or in museums in ethiopia or in other countries and there are captions to the plates which provide a rather comprehensive rundown on the background and historical significance of the art works there also are bibliographical notes which under the circumstances the first encyclopedic references to ethiopian art were entered around the turn of the century reveal a paucity of research in this area furthermore nearly all the research material is in french german and italian and there is a general index the book was printed in italy by fantoni artegrafica venezia apparently it was first published in milan in and the english translation is by claire pace whatever the case ethiopian painting is a singular book a proud specimen for those concerned with african art and history the costat is indeed quite high but great care and artistry joy adamson is well known in naturalist and moviegoing circles as the white britisher who wrote so persuasively of her relationship with the lioness elsa there were three or four of the elsa books and a film based on them and elsa has as a consequence been established as one of the more gracious heroines of all animalhood mrs adamson has now tried her hand with a book on humans in the land of elsa kenya by name the book is the peoples of kenya harcourt brace world and it is a big book well suited for children of all ages if not of all outlooks which is not to say that it is not a remarkable book for it is even more remarkable than apparent when one realizes that nearly all the photographs and entirely all the paintings reproduced in this lavishly illustrated book are the work of mrs adamson mrs adamson set out to record on canvas the flora of kenya but she became so fascinated with its fauna human and otherwise that she decided to put some of them on canvas too the kenya government presumably under the british commissioned her to do so after she had undertaken the work on her own initiative and at her own expense the emphasis is on the various peoples of kenya as much as possible in their native state that is in the areas as removed as possible from the influences of encroachingwesternization in this mrs adamson and her book have performed a most useful service she deals knowledgeably with the different tribes of kenya and with their customs and clothing the pages are crammed with valuable information humanized by mrs adamsons uncomplicated personalized narrative style there is an epilogue written in a more sophisticated if also more technical style by g w b huntingford an anthropologist excellent features of the book are the index and the elaborate map of kenya and neighboring countries on the inside covers of the book which locates the major tribal and ethnic groups discussed in the book there also are helpful explanatory notes and a glossary of abbreviations plus a bibliography the reader will not find in the peoples of kenya any photographs of the modern metropolis of nairobi nor any reference to the fact that kenya is the most industrialized of the newly independent countries in east africa but that is the subject of some other book hwf the dance through the ages madison square press by walter sorell is one of those big handsome profusely illustrated books which appear every autumn just in case someone is thinking of the holidays and the gift problem and the dance through the ages it should be said directly will make a splendid gift for the dance buff holiday or not the text is comprehensive mr sorell begins with a consideration of primitive dancing elaborating his simple thesis that dancing is a medium of mans selfassertion an outlet for surplus energy a supreme means of expression the succeeding chapters of the plus page book ranges through such diversions as the rules of ritual folklore and theater the triumph of romanticism pioneers of modern dance martha graham graces the cover and after diaghilev there are chapters on the dances of the east the renaissance man and cancanization and there are chapters on the mass media and the dance dealing with the movies the stage musicals and television and recording the dance of very special interest to negro digest readers of course is the chapter on jazz and the negro dance which mr sorell has handled with perception and knowledge some of the most beautiful of many extraordinary photos in the book are shots of alvin ailey and his dancers against a black backdrop the dance in africa of course also is considered in the opening chapter of the book the dance through the ages is rich in illustration both photos and drawings and both color and black and white walter sorell teaches the history of the dance and theater and dramatic literature at columbia university and at the new school for social research in new york city he also is a contributing editor to dance magazinehwf i there have been many books about south africa but ernest coles house of bondage random house gains extra force with its expressive photographs which bring before our eyes the conditions which mr cole with thomas flaherty describes in the text after seeing photographs of a starving baby a schoolteacher exhausted after a day in an overcrowded schoolroom and ragged streetboys huddled in a park one gets a deeper feeling of the land and of the conditions the people have to endure ernest cole had to pose as a pilgrim to lourdes to escape from south africa with his photographs previously when he had been questioned by the police about them he had to pretend that he was working on a story about juvenile delinquency to prevent the police from confiscating them the photographs are excellent they range from striking portraits to action shots of tsotsis from zoot suit picking the pocket of an afrikaaner and mugging another to mood shots of the loneliness of the exiles village of frenchdale there is an introduction by joseph lelyveld who met mr cole while he was new york times correspondent in south africa in the text which precedes each section of photographs mr cole describes various aspects of south africa the mines transportation the police the locations servants apartheid bantu education hospitals religion streetboys and tsotsis shebeens and beer halls the middle class banishment education now has become education for servitude in the stricter apartheid today the state in its haste sometimes tears down the old locations to remove the blacks before it has built new towns for them and consequently they have to live in tents the best jobs are reserved for whites outside of a few doctors and awyers to serve the blacks the best that an african can hope for is to be a servant or messenger the result of this blocking of advancement is the streetboys and the adult tsotsis who live by crime and robbery since they are used to violence if there is a confrontation between whites and blacks the tsotsis would be the spearhead of violence since the middle class cannot advance they measure their status by the difference between themselves and those who are poorer or less educated they pathetically treasure tea or dinner with liberal whites and scorn to serve on committees with someone who may be a servant thus their potential leadership is often lost both the text and the photographs make conditions in south africa vivid to us but the pictures add extra values of emotion interest and aesthetics which make it a desirable purchasedudley randall at bull street denmark vesey stood in r front of his mirror carefully knotting his cravat he spent a few seconds searching his beard for gray hairs then he slipped into his coat set his hat squarely on his head and picked up his bible and a package wrapped in brown paper from the top of his dresser he gazed thoughtfully at the package and then dropped it in his pocket after one last glance at his short dark frame in the mirror he went out the back door and down the dirt path toward his buggy where peter poyas waited squatting beside the horses as he crossed the yard he heard the cannon at fort moultrie booming across the charleston harbor shaking the city out of its sunday afternoon lethargy he watched the cannon smoke billow up into the still carolina sky and catch the last copper streaks of sunlight as the sun like a huge ball of fire slipped down behind the ashley river sending long shadows creeping up the narrow twisted streets over wooden fences across wide flowered yards and into the cool frame houses of the town the horses stirred rattling their harnesses as denmark approached the buggy and peter poyas rose shifting his shoulders in his stiff sunday coat his great neck straining against his shirt collar i still dont see why you have to go through with this denmark he said handing denmark the reins if

your temper you hear ill watch it ill watch it see you tonight after church peter nodded and slapped the flank of the near horse and the buggy whirred down the lane alongside the house two deep lines creased his brow as he stood gazing at denmarks erect back then he followed lane out onto bull street wagons and buggies filled mostly with negroes dressed in their sunday finery rolled softly up and down the street as the people passed peter poyas their faces brightened evening peter evening hidee peter coming to the services tonight on my way there now sister on my way now peter started across the street where ned and rolla bennett waited in one of their masters wagons ned sat rooted in the high front seat like a black buddha patiently flicking the reins at the flies buzzing around the mules beside him slouched rolla his long legs jutting out over the wagon his eyes wandering over the passing girls while his hands caressed the polished back of the guitar that rested in his lap when peter reached the wagon rolla quickly stood up moved behind the front seat leaned over the side and helped peter into the wagon ned clucked at the mules and they lumbered east towards kings road a carriage driven by a large black man glided past them fluttering with reds and greens and blues worn by a mulatto woman and three brown girls the driver smiled and waved his hand peter and ned smiled and waved rolla grunted there goes that ol jim pencill mista god amighty hisself just cause he free he thinks he bettern the rest of us niggers sheeit he wont even let his daughters dance with us ned said take it easy boy he only been free a few years and he aint got used to it yet yaa mista denmark free and he dont act like that well denmark been free for twenty years and that makes a difference said ned besides i think jim would be a good man to have with us he got a lotta say with the mill street niggers plus he gotta lot of kinfolks in north hampstead what do you say peter peter spoke for the first time i dont trustim remember how he voted back in seventeen when we decided to set up our own church ned said yeah yeah i reckin maybe you right anyway well decide tonight after church for sure they reached kings road and turned north on it they crossed calhoun street and ned urged the mules on to escape the sharp odors of the stock pens as they rolled past the old citadel rolla peered into the shadows surrounding the high gloomy walls he shivered remembering the tales of ghosts and torture and blood and rape and cocked his head to catch some whisper from the stillness they passed into open country and the darkness closed in fast the june night was clear and starless a pale yellow moon sneaked up behind their backs and glided along the tops of the trees that hustled in the shadows alongside the road from a close by pond frogs bassed out their songs nearer crickets clicked out their mes sages up ahead they saw the lights of the african methodist episcopal church glowing in the darkness ned stuck his pipe in his mouth for one last smoke peter shifted his shoulders in his tight coat rolla stood up swaying in the middle of the wagon and began to tune his guitar hey mista peter rolla said aint ol jim pencill supposed to preach tonight uh huh well i sure hope he dont stand up there and talk all night so well have some time left for singing and dancing id druther hear mista denmark preach anytime i reckin we aint gonna have no time for singing or dancing tonight peter said i think wed better get back to denmarks house right after the preaching im a little worried about him new glanced quickly at peter and said why whats the mater peter said denmarks took it in his head again to try to buy bell and benji free from ol mista faulkner and you know as well as i do how its gonna come out yeah ned said nodding slowly he twisted around in his seat and looked at rolla i dont wanna have to come looking for you rolla and find you gallivantin out in the woods you be at the wagon right after preaching you hear the buggy reeled down the moonfilled road and still denmark cracked the reins across the backs of the drumming horses a moan slipped out of his lips and was snatched away by the wind his head whirled his ears roared suddenly he felt his stomach heaving and he hauled back on the reins before the horses had stopped he leaped from the buggy and stumbled into a grove of pine trees at the edge of the road vomit spewed from his mouth and nose a spasm shook him his knees buckled and as he fell face forward into his own waste the sharp scent of pine and cedar rose in waves around him slowly he regained consciousness he struggled to his knees and looked around down the road he saw his horses and buggy standing quietly in the moonlight above him he heard an owl hoot and flutter its wings he crawled to a tree and leaned his back against it as his head cleared what had happened back at the faulkner house flooded back into his mind and a scream surged out of his chest cutting through the tall trees and shattering the still night when he wheeled his buggy into the faulkner driveway he had seen bell standing in the doorway of her cabin which lay behind and to the right of the rambling unpainted main house he knew that she had been watching for him and he smiled and threw up his hand he saw her shift in the doorway and place one hand on her hip shes all of fifty he thought and still as fine a looking woman as ever ill be down directly he called aloud i gotta see mista faulkner first he saw her nod and sink down in the doorway behind her in the dim light of the cabin he thought he caught a glimpse of benji and he smiled again he drove around to the back of the main house whoaed the horses and climbed down from the buggy he patted the brown package in his coat pocket clutched his bible under his arm and marched up to the back door as he rapped on the door peters voice flitted through his mind now you remember you aint got no right to go stirring up things the door swung open and conroy faulkners tall wide body filled the yellow block of light denmark said evening mista faulkner i came to visit bell and benji but first id like to talk a little business with you come on in denmark faulkner said i been meaning to talk to you too come on in he retreated into the room dragged a chair from under the kitchen table and sat down crossing his legs at the ankles tufts of reddish hair streaked with gray peeped from under his widebrimmed hat that shadowed the upper part of his face the galluses of his breeches flapped down and his massive chest was bare and pale against the red brown of his neck and lower arms he clasped his hands over his stomach now ringed with fat and looked up at denmark who had followed him into the room denmark he said ive knowed you for a long timeever since i bought bell and ive alius gave you leeway to see her even more so after you got benji by her aint that right yessir and thats what i want to see you about what im saying is that i cant have you coming to see bell and the boy no more you ruining the boy just today i had to i whatre you talking about denmark took a step forward look i got three thousand dollars and ill give it all to you straight out for bell and the boy he drew the brown package from his coat pocket and thrust it in faulkners face three thousand dollars and you wont have to worry about seeing me around here no more faulkner let his eyes slide away from the money cant you get it through your head that bell and benji aint for sale they mine and i dont want you round here no more you ruining the boy you but mista faulkner didnt you promise me years ago and each year after that that i could buy bell and benji now didnt you faulkner lowered his chin on his chest and said softly yeah i did but things was different then my wife was living and conroy junior was still at home but i aint gonna sell bell and the boy to you now his voice dropped lower they all i got and you gonna have to stay away coming round here filling the boys head with all kinds of stuff youyou even got bell acting like she dont belong to me denmark felt the anger rising in him and the shame he pressed his bible tighter under his arm trying to still the tremors running through his body he had thought that he had grown accustomed to the shame that unique humiliation that swept over him each time he had to obtain faulkners permission to visit bell and benji but now it struck him like a hammer thoughts that he had suppressed for years rose to the surface of his mind this was not just a matter of his trying to buy two slaves but of two men wanting the same woman had peter known is that why he had said aint no amount of money gonna matter is that why faulkner had made excuses year after year suddenly he realized that he was not at all sure of bell didnt he after all have other women and children and had he failed year after year to buy her freedom he felt his heart pounding again peters words flashed across his mind you aint got no right but he spun on his heels stepped to the door and jerked it open his voice shoving the light spilling out into the dark yard bell you come up here right now you come up here and you bring the boy listen nigger whats got into you no nigger can come on my property cause you free you still a nigger denmark turned from the door and approached faulkner again holding out the money to him he saw faulkner glance at the money three thousand dollars mista faulkner he said with this money you can move into town and be near mista conroy junior denmark paused wondering why he was all at once a little concerned for this man then he continued and i tell you what ill fix up a small place for you therereal cheap aint i one of the best carpenters in town what do you want to stay out here for anyhow the lands wore out youre going deeper and deeper into debt every year he heard bell enter the room but he kept his eyes on faulkner who still sat with his chin on his chest the anger in him that had died down momentarily flared again now that bell was here hed show this man what was what what i cant understand mista faulkner is why you wont sell bell and benji free now bell already knows that you promised faulkner jerked up his head nigger you shut up then he saw bell and his voice dropped ive said all im gonna say denmark now you get off my property denmark looked at bell she stood quietly just inside the door her hands folded across her shift her wide eyes darting from him to faulkner her bottom lip caught between her teeth he held her eyes and said but mista faulkner all im trying to do is buy two nigger slaves for three thousand dollars now why would you a white man refuse to sell two niggers for three times what theyre worth faulkner shoved up from the chair his face livid denmark turned facing him and he could see that he was plunging past the danger point but even as peters warning was beating through his brain words were tumbling out of his mouth bells my woman mista faulkner she might be your slave but shes my woman keeping his eyes locked with faulkners he stretched out his hand toward bell and said come here bell come over here he saw faulkners mouth open and then clamp shut the silence seemed like twenty years he noticed a vein throbbing in faulkners temple and felt his own heart pounding in his throat at the edge of his vision he saw bell pressed against the wall beside the door again he motioned with his outstretched hand and said come on over here bell he saw her sway almost imperceptibly in his direction and his heart sang his happiness died before it was born he saw faulkners eyes darting around the room and the blood draining from his face you aint got no right to go stirring up things not right now just for your woman and boy he had to stop bell he tried to run his tongue over his dry lip and he felt his face cracking as he forced himself to grin he couldnt risk everything just to satisfy himself dont look like shes gonna come mista faulkner he said must be hard of hearing aint worth no three thousand dollars nohow he saw the tenseness disappear from faulkners body well nigger im glad you came to your senses for awhile i thought i was gonna have to he knows im lying denmark thought but he cant do nothing aloud he said hell aint no old nigger woman worth that much bother faulkner was conciliatory you gonna have to git it through your head denmark that you a nigger even though you free the next time wont be no next time mista faulkner denmark grinned he knows im lying denmark thought but he wont do anything about it because then hes admitting to bell and to hisself that she is a woman to him and not just a slave but what is bell thinking he looked at her she wouldnt meet his eyes her shoulders seemed to droop he clenched his bible and screamed silently you awful lucky i like you denmark you a good hard working nigger most of the time but i cant have you round bell and the boy no more his tone changed now you git on home and consider yourself lucky yessir mista faulkner denmark grinned i sure will he felt the room swaying but he kept the smile on his face he looked again at bell her eyes were still on the floor his bell of over twenty years bell with the strong thighs and tender hands bell who nodded and understood even urged him when he alone bought his freedom and left her with only promises you aint got no right to go stirring up things i got to get out of here he thought i got to get out of here he began to move backwards toward the door the grin still pasted on his face and the next time i catch you on my property ill put the law on you or shoot you and you stay away from that boy you the cause i had to whip him today anyhow that boy got to learn denmark thought i got to get out of here before i kill him right now before i kill him right now before i kill him right now still moving backwards he stumbled out of the back door dropping his bible and as he regained his footing he saw benji standing in the darkness silently his eyes glowing like two moons had he heard benji he took a step toward him but benji shrinked along the wall and slipped through the doorway benji benji the loner the swift who ran all day through the woods and fields who wasnt yet broken to the harness the promises he started for the door you aint got no right not right now he stopped the air rushed out of his lungs perspiration stung his eyes he saw the block of light in the doorway waver and begin to spin and he turned and fled he scrambled into the buggy and fumbled for the reins as he wheeled his buggy around he spotted his bible the pages fluttering laying in the path of light streaming out into the yard he slapped the reins across the horses backs sending them bolting down the driveway now he staggered to his feet made his way out of the grove of pines to the road and headed for his horses and buggy that still stood quietly in the moonlight down the road pulling his handkerchief from his pocket he began to wipe the vomit from his clothes his body still shook and his knees were weak he paused to catch his breath then started again ill wait no longer he said aloud ill die if i wait any longer the sound of his own voice stilled his trembling and strengthened his legs he the prayer ended jim pencill rose from his knees and stepped up to the pulpit as the congregation shuffled and scraped and settled back on the benches he thumbed the pages of his bible finding his place he held it with his finger and looked out over the sea of black faces brothers and sisters he said tonight im going to take my text from the book of exodus the twentysecond twentythird and twentyfourth verses he looked down at his finger and read haltingly and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up to god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them jim pencill paused to let his words sink in then he laced his fingers together rested his elbows on his bible and said brothers and sisters i want you to pay real close attention to these holy verses and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt diedin the process of time rolla shifted in his seat he crossed and uncrossed his legs folded and unfolded his arms then he glanced down the bench at ned and peter ned sat with his eyes closed his hands folded across his stomach rolla didnt see neds lips move at all and barely heard the angry murmur i dont aim to die a slave in the process of time and after hearing their cries and moans god had respect for the children of israelrespect because they kept his commandments even while in bondage rolla saw peters composed face slowly turn toward him and their eyes met catching the tiny light in peters eyes he smothered the smile forming in his lips he wasnt sure if the flash had been of laughter or of anger then his eyes dropped to peters lap and when he saw the clenched fists he knew and in time god delivered the children of israel out of their bondage in the process of time god rolla crossed his legs again his guitar in his lap and let his eyes roam over the crowd of black faces hoping to catch the eye of some pretty girl
mron karenga is a spokesman highly endowed not only with the power to rap in a manner black but with a cois severely systematic this means it is possible to read a succession of declarations on art for instance that require no more space than three pages and gain at the same time a definitive introduction to his thought his powers of compression are no less remarkable and are eloquently spoken for by the fact that the entire text which is entitled the quotable karenga and which covers at least seven major areas requires no more than thirty pages also due to close philosophical kinship to both malcolm_x and to leroi jones his remarks help to clarify by their wealth of implications far more than his own distinctive position that position being black cultural nationalism nationalism be it black or white must by its very nature conceive of revolution as a public rather than a personal event as a result individualism is one of its primary objects of attack and diversity one of its first casualties this initial attack is prompted by a sincere desire for unity and reasonably enough public minded movements have never been content to pursue unity without also seeking to control the people they would unify therefore no one should be surprised that karengas opening remark on art is a simple declaration of social control over it black art must be for the people by the people and from the people that is to say it must be functional collective and committing this is a very important premise for the last three words are used at a later point to explain what art must be in order to be revolutionary in addition we learn that all art is the reflection of the values of the people this is understood in such a way as to allow karenga to dismiss individuality and the concept of art for arts sake now this dismissal of these two concepts is partly explained by a general concern for what might be continued from page called renegade brothers those who reach for what is thought to be above the heads and interests of the general black public sometimes this reaching out and beyond is hasty careless and in a certain sense selfdestructive because of the bland unexamined values that often support it and karenga like malcolm and jones has a number of penetrating things to say about mixedup values but it should be admitted that part of this singular striving is also due to honest dissent to bringing ones own values and attitudes not to mention those of ones community ones black community into serious question but more significantly it is the effort to go ones own way to follow ones personal bent ones individual path there is a very subtle link between the question of individuality and the notion of art for its own sake it is taken for granted that there is a relationship between the two what that relationship is however is another matter it is usually reduced to subjectivism which is scandalous enough to those critics who insist on defining everything in social terms charges of artificiality and decadence are also popular objections with regard to the nature of art karengas two key words are collective and functional and he is being very shrewd in making them so the first term has to do with origin art is seen as the product of the people all art should be the product of a creative need and desire in terms of black people and again all art reflects the value system from which it comes it should be noted that function and origin are related especially when the purpose is said to derive from the needs of a people black people of course in this case any artist who believes this does considerable violence to his calling and it would be a very serious matter were it not for the miraculous wonderinspiring resilience of art to which the much abused notion of art for arts sake is a very stubborn witness this notion declares nothing less than the selfdetermination and the selfsufficiency of art it is one way of confronting us with the powerful suggestion that what makes us alive and what makes us artists is one and the same force it is another way of saying that art makes the artist rather than the other way around it does so by allowing him to tap his own inner resources and one consideration that should be kept in as steady a focus as possible is the meaning of individuality for there is no better way of calling attention to the irrelevance of bringing up the issue of subjectivity and collectivity more popularly called objectivity individuality means wholeness the sort of indivisibility one associates with the classic notion of an atom collective and subjective refer to the relative point from which reality is to be viewed individuality on the other hand is concerned with reality itself and not with the position from which we may view it it is a level and an order of reality beyond which one simply cannot go like a real atom it can not be reduced any further it is a matter of foundation and anchorage and art itself furnishes the artist with a self a new self just as a guitar or a piano grants new fingers it makes one conscious of a true and sobering individuality and its initial work its initial relationship to the artist reveals itself to be a most rigorous severe exacting sweeping and delightful as well as thoroughgoing system of a truly radical reorientation both for the artist and for us the audience ray charles not only sings the blues he is also the product of the blues that is to say he is the product the extoller the champion the creation of his own art form and his music which is also our music without the necessity of regimenting him allows for a number of things it allows him to be a man it does so by allowing him to be a real individual this it does by not only allowing him to tap his own vocal resources but also by transforming his blindness and his whole body as well if you really want revolutionary change here it is the spectacle the drama of a man changed and charged and turned into the mysterious power of a vocabulary and a grammar called the blues a whole language in fact somethings got a hold of me it must be art if its a musician thats being grabbed art takes care of its own just as it takes care of us administering to the spot where we need to be moved and stirred the need which drives aretha to sing to moan to shout is identical in source to what drives us to hear her now these are real live needs and her art attends to hers no less than to ours talk about function and change and what do we think puts this art and these artists before us as vital resources for us life there are some people who need coltrane more urgently than a drink so karenga must be mistaken when he suggests that black artists should go around following the people the case would almost appear to be the reverse but not quite for both artist and audience go around following pursuing hungering for what keeps and makes them both alive persons who regard the social aspect of a humans reality as the whole story or as the most significant part cannot be blamed for their misguided efforts to apply an external rather than this native function to art since it can hardly occur to them that art has its own natural inherent builtin reason for being which is to liberate by being lifegiving and lifewitnessing and therefore a reflection of life now if art really went about as karenga and jones insist simply docilely following the people and what they take their needs to be there would be little chance of liberating them the notion that we are merely social beings is part of the chaos from which art has the power to free us and the notions which people bring to all the vital areas of life are in reality part of the deadly folly in which men black and white individualists and nationalists are forever perishing all people spend endless effort artists included in resisting the truth about their lives this question of the selfsufficiency of art and its connection with revolution cannot be overstressed art is inherently revolutionary part of its real force as a criticism of people and society is derived in part from its very diversity it is no accident that karenga harps on the values of the people he takes pains to do so in such a way as to suggest they are familiar to all indisputable and above all simple the needs of the people receive the same shortchanged treatment in the utterances of malcolm stokely carmichael and jones negroes are ruthlessly streamlined and standardized for convenient oversimplification theres nothing like it for enhancing ones persuasiveness but art with its diversity of points of view always manages to reveal people to be far more complex and various than we are otherwise willing to admit or to face for we seldom know quite what to do with this disturbing complexity this unneat unpredictableness human nature surprises and trips us up both jones and karenga stress change and movement this is central to their understanding of what a revolution should accomplish this is also central to an artist why else is the artist forever talking about freedom he needs freedom to move and freedom assumes an order of diversity in art that bewilders even the artist but the relevant point is this art is inherently revolutionary because the change it requires not to mention the changes it requires of the artist himself and the nature of that change is transformation it is also essentially personal rather than political and by being personal it is therefore at bottom religious which takes us to karengas real objection to the blues our creative motif must be revolution all art that does not discuss or contribute to revolutionary change is invalid that is why the blues are invalid they teach resignation in a word acceptance of realityand we have come to change reality this is a very curious position to be backed into it would surely relieve some of the absurdity if karenga would only allow just enough individuality to justify accepting so personal an attitude as resignation then he wouldnt be forced into the even more untenable position of rejecting so major a part of the peoples value system as the blues it would certainly behoove him to accept just enough reality to enable his objection to the blues to constitute a real objection shouldnt he accept just enough reality to come by some real alternatives to real resignation but it would never do for a person determined not to accept reality to accept real standards with which to replace the one he really doesnt like but of course karenga hasnt real reality in mind but simply a social one that is to say he has only a real part instead of the real whole so he can perhaps be forgiven nor is it his fault that he rejects his peoples past ways and past thinking a black nationalist can not escape assuming his peoples sense of reality is unreal how else could he reasonably define as his goal the establishment and the development of a culture for his people without first rejecting as mistaken the stubborn belief that black people already have a culture a tradition of which both the negros speech and abundant musical expression are a definitive and irrefutable part it is instructive to remember that karengas views are no random affair they are rigorously achieved and arrived at they form inevitable parts of a system that system being black cultural nationalism we now come to the third and final element which forms his criteria for an art that would be revolutionary in addition to being collective and functional black art must be committing this term turns out to be not a third element at all because to insist that art is to be revolutionary is simply another way of saying it is to be committed to revolution and knowing that art is to be collective we can assume that commitment cannot be a matter of personal choice since black art is accountable to what is called the people and apparently under their control any art whether black nationalist or not which has the misfortune to be so collective as to allow for no individuality must be totally impersonal as well and therefore a perfect paternalistic formula and framework for black slavery and black suicide and by way of conclusion let us refocus on this element of paternalism for it is the most characteristic and widespread feature to be found in the rhetoric of all sorts of spokesmen for black revolution not only artists renegade or otherwise but the people too who get flattered and burdened with so much tyrannical power are treated in this manner we all are we all are looked upon and regarded by our socalled black liberators as so many sheep there is a serious problem here among these our own revolutionaries they seem to have a serious case of shepherdcomplex and it is a tragedy for a people such as we to have produced a generation of youth who seem on the evidence so utterly indifferent to what all the fuss has always been about who no longer remember that revolution is aimed at freedom not control not regimentation not a mass of afroheaded robots but freedom and the black artists who jump into such a constricting bag for the sake of unity have surely placed themselves in a black straitjacket and with their mouths wide open to swallow a black mans cup of hemlock mitting or committed since this is traditionally valid it stands to reason that we should attempt to use it as the foundation for a rational construction to meet our present day needs and by no mere coincidence we find that the criteria is not only valid but inspiring that is why we say that all black art irregardless of any technical requirements must have three basic characteristics which make it revolutionary in brief it must be functional collective and committing it must be functional that is useful as we cannot accept the false doctrine of art for arts sake for in fact there is not such thing as art for arts sake all art reflects the value system from which it comes for if the artist created only for himself and not for others he would lock himself up somewhere and paint or write or play just for himself but he does not do that on the contrary he invites us over even insists that we come to hear him or to see his work in a word he expresses a need for our evaluation andor appreciation and our evaluation cannot be a favorable one if the work of art is not first functional that is useful so what then is the use of art our art black art black art must expose the enemy praise the people and support the revolution it must be like leroi jones poems that are assassins poems poems that kill and shoot guns and wrassle cops into alleys taking their weapons leaving them dead with tongues pulled out and sent to ireland it must be functional like the poem of another revolutionary poet from us clyde halisi who described the masters words as sun genies dancing through the crowd snatching crosses and st christophers from around niggers necks and passing the white gapped legs in their minds to simbas to be disposed of or in terms of painting we do not need pictures of oranges in a bowl or trees standing innocently in the midst of a wasteland if we must paint oranges and trees let our guerrillas be eating those oranges for strength and using those trees for cover we need new images and oranges in a bowl or fat white women smiling lewdly cannot be those images all material is mute until the artist gives it a message and that message must be a message of revolution then we have destroyed art for arts sake which is of no use anyhow and have developed art for all our sake art for mose the miner sammy the shoeshine boy t c the truck driver and k p the unwilling soldier in conclusion the real function of art is to make revolution using its own medium the second characteristic of black art is that it must be collective in a word it must be from the people and must be returned to the people in a form more beautiful and colorful than it was in real life for that is what art is everyday life given more form and color and in relationship to that the black artist can find no better subject than black people themselves and the black artist who does not choose or develop this subject will find himself unproductive for no one is any more than the context to which he owes his existence and if an artist owes his existence to the afroamerican context then he also owes his art to that context and therefore must be held accountable to the people of that context to say that art must be collective however raises four questions number one the question of popularization versus elevation two personality versus individuality three diversity in unity and four freedom to versus freedom from the question of popularization versus elevation is an old one what it really seeks to do is to ask and to answer the question whether or not art should be lowered to the level of the people or the people raised to the level of art our contention is that if art is from the people and for the people there is no question of raising people to art or lowering art to the people for they are one and the same thing as we said previouslyart is everyday life given more form and color and what one seeks to do then is to use art as a means of educating the people and being educated by them so that it is a mutual exchange rather than a oneway communication art and people must develop at the same time and for the same reason it must move with the masses and be moved by the masses for we should not demand that our people go to school to learn to appreciate art but that an artist go to school formally or informally to learn new and better techniques of expressing his appreciation for the people and all they represent and his disdain for anything and everything that threatens or hinders their existence then and only then can both the artist and the people move forward with a positive pace rooted to the reality of revolution the second question raised is the question of personality versus individuality now this question is one of how much the emphasis on collective art destroys the individuality of the artist we say that individualism is a luxury that we cannot afford moreover individualism is in effect nonexistent for since no one is any more than the context to which he owes his existence he has no individuality only personality individuality by definition is me in spite of everyone and personality is me in relation to everyone the one a useless isolation and the other an important involvement we have heard it even said that the individual is like an atom that which can no longer be reduced or the essence of humanity however aside from this being a rather strained analogy it does not prove that a man who wants to be an individual can stand alone for the atom itself is a part of a molecule and cannot exist without interdependence and even then it is at best a simple theoretical construction for the convenience of conversation we say that there is no virtue in a false independence but there is value in a real interdependence the third question raised with regard to collective art is an extension of the second one and that is does unity preclude diversity our answer to that is an emphatic no for there can be and is unity in diversity even as there can be diversity in unity what one seeks however is not a standardization of every move or creation but a framework in which one can create and avoid the european gift of trial and error one can seek the reality of the concept of diversity in unity or unity in diversity in listening to a trippin ensemble in a trippin ensemble the leader sets the pace and others come in or go out as it pleases them but in the end they all come to a very dynamic and overwhelmingly harmonious conclusion so it is with our dance two partners dance together the same dance and yet they provide us with a demonstration of that which is unique in each of them but that is not individualitythat is personality for it is an expression of uniqueness not isolation from but in relation to each other and the collective experience that they both have shared the last question is one of freedom to versus freedom from this is really a political question or social one and is one that raises contradiction for the artist who rejects the social interpretation of art however when he demands freedom to do something or freedom from the restriction that prohibits his doing something he is asking for a sociopolitical right and that as we said makes art social first and aesthetic second art does not exist in the abstract just like freedom does not exist in the abstract it is not an independent living thing it lives through us and through the meaning and message we give it and an artist may have any freedom to do what he wishes as long as it does not take the freedom from the people to be protected from those images words and sounds that are negative to their life and development the people give us the freedom from isolation and alienation and random searching for subject matter and artists in view of this must not ask for freedom to deny this but on the contrary must praise the people for this in conclusion the concept of collective art can best be expressed in the african proverb showing the interdependence of all by saying one hand washes the other the final thing that is characteristic of black art is that it must be committing it must commit us to revolution and change it must commit us to a future that is ours in a word it must commit us to all that is usyesterday today and the sunrise of tomorrow it must tell us like halisis poem maulana and word magic that we must give up the past or be found out and exposed as the notes of a new day come tripping through searching each ones heart for any traces of pevton place it must commit us to the fact that the earth is ours and the fullness thereof as leroi jones says you cant steal nothing from the white man hes already stole it he owes you anything you want even his life so black people take the shit you want take their lives if need but get what you want what you need dance up and down the street turn all the music up this is commitment to the struggle a commitment that includes the artist and the observer we cannot let each other rest there is so much to do and we all know we have done so little art will revive us inspire us give us enough courage to face another disappointing day it must not teach us resignation for all our art must contribute to revolutionary change and if it does not it is invalid therefore we say the blues are invalid for they teach resignation in a word acceptance of reality and we have come to change reality we will not submit to the resignation of our fathers who lost their money their women and their lives and sat around wondering what did they do to be so black and blue we will say again with brother leroi we are lovers and the sons of lovers and warriors and the sons of warriors therefore we will loveand unwillingly though necessarily make war revolutionary war we will not cry for those things that are gone but find meaning in those things that remain with us perhaps people will object violently to the idea that the blues are invalid but one should understand that they are not invalid historically they will always represent a very beautiful musical and psychological achievement of our people but today they are not functional because they do not commit us to the struggle of today and tomorrow but keep us in the past and whatever we do we cannot remain in the past for we have too much at stake in the present and we find our future much too much rewarding to be rejected let our art remind us of our distaste for the enemy our love for each other and our commitment to the revolutionary struggle that will be fought with the rhythmic reality of a permanent revolution there is a spirit of revolution abroad in the shadowy world of letters in black america not all black writers are attuned i f to it of course and some are even opposed to it which is to be expected also one supposes great change is always terrifying especially to those who have found niches in the established structure and wish to remain secure but change is upon us there is therefore a wide divergence of opinion among black writers as to their role in society as to their role in the black revolution as to their role as artistsall these considerations tied into and touching on the others negro digest polled some black writers both famous and unknown asking the questions which are published on page the questions elicited from the writers opinions relative to the books and writers which have influenced them the writers who are most important to them in terms of achievement and promise and what they think about the new movement toward a black aesthetic and the preoccupation with the black experience aspects of the larger black consciousness movement the replies from the writers are extraordinarily rich and no attempt will be made in this issue of the magazine to collate and analyze all the material rather pertinent statements from the questionnaires are published on these pages dealing primarily with the last dozen questions along with a general essay intended as background and summary richard wright once wrote that both black and white americans resist facing the truth of the racist nature of this country a statement which on the face of it does not seem so profound and vet it is at the beginning of with at least half a dozen various government and private agencies engaged in studying the causes of upheaval in the cities the sharpness of richard wrights insight falls into focus both black and white americans accept the proposition after years together in this land that it is necessary to spend millions of dollars hold dozens of hearings and engage the services of platoons of sociologists and myriad other social scientists in order to determine why black americans are raising unholv hell m against the conditions of their lives which white americans have forced upon them and richard wright also understood why black americans cling more desperately than white americans to the rules of the game of illusion the game is easier to play for whiles after all they have all the advantages and guilt and a nagging feeling of indecency however uncomfortable at times are bearable black americans on the other hand have no defenses at all beyond their flimsy veil once that is torn away and they must confront the reality of what they are and of their collaboration against their own humanity they will have no alternative but to act but actiongenuine effective actionis w what thev fear most in succumb ing to the rage and bitterness which are the natural fruits of their degraded existence thev would face the ultimate dangersimprisonment or death and of course thev cannot do that they have made the other choice they have chosen to live however dishonorably and they have found a million w wavs of rationalizing the failure to act the refusal to end the limitations other men have placed on their freedom richard wrights knowledge of the truth about americans was the strength of his work or as many of his critics would argue its weakness for these critics would no forgive him for not diluting his rage and clarity in obscurity of saunders reddings distinguished career as professor and author spans more years than many of the writers polled have been alive and of course unlike many of the younger writers mr redding is familiar with an extraordinary range of literature his answers to the questions naturally reflect his solid base in traditional literary approaches and attitudes mr redding is one of the living writers who was personally acquainted with richard wright and mr redding has no doubts that the later works of the late richard wright suffered because in his european exile wright had lost touch with the living american reality and wright himself thought so too mr redding says saunders redding does mr redding see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic no not in america besides aesthetics has no racial national or geographical boundaries beauty and truth the principal components of aesthetics are universal and should the black writers journey toward art lead through exploitation of the black experience the journey should carry the writerblack or whitethrough the familiar country of his mind and heart through what he knows best and feels most mr redding grew impatient with the question as to what is the most important novel written by a black writer since invisible man again youre asking for absolutes and damn it in this business there are no absolutes except in a negative sense theres no such thing as the most important novel and theres been no really good novel by a negro in years mr redding also said that there have been no important black playwrights in this or any other centurynot in americaalice walker a very talented young woman out of rural georgia has been fantastically busy in the past few years but has now settled down in mississippi for serious work like samuel allen she finds both john a williams and mari evans among the promising and important writers and she thinks the man who cried i am is probably the most important novel by a black writer since invisible man as to whether black writers should direct their work toward black audiences miss walker replies black writers should direct their work towards an audience some imaginary ideal audience that will appreciate what they have to say novelist as the most important black american writer of all time there was no attempt by n egro digest to poll only those writers who have published books or to exclude those whose ideas are different from the editors and so the writers represented here cover the whole ranse of creativitv from those authors highly esteemed by the literary establishment to those who arc known only to a small coterie of local readers some of the writers are grandparents and others are barely in their twenties unsurprisingly then there are contrasting and conflicting viewpoints and the distance between the educational qualifications of the respondents is sometimes very great indeed generallv the older writers and profit from it to write solely for a black audience is limiting and presumes too much that they will appreciate your efforts that they will try to understand you that they will care enough about your work to buy your books and that white people could never get anything be made better one might say from what one writes my own family has squashed my illusions that black audiences are more perceptive or moved more than white ones the only time they will read my material is when l send it to them i think it is only important that we write from within ourselves and that we direct our efforts outward period i would have liked for victor hugo to like my stories quite as much as i admire his one of the younger writers whose work most of which is as yet unpublished shows uncommon talent carolyn rodgers replied yes of course to the question do you see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic and her reply to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences was eloquently simple yes when they want to and no when they dont want to and ultimately they always will when the realization comes that the only audience which will listen to anything that takes guts to be said is a black audience charles wright an alumnus of the handy school where james jones wrote his first novel from here to eternity is author of two published novels the messenger and the wig mr wright is unknown as individual and as author to most black readers and indeed to other black writers although his two novels received favorable notices it came as a surprise and perhaps also as revelation to have mr wright suggest the novel the confessions of nat turner by william styron as a book dealing with the negros role in history which is recommended for study by negro children the literary value of mr styrons novel aside most black writers have reservations about the book and some black writers have reacted violently against it beacon press will publish a collection of essays by black writers dealing with mr styrons work which incidentally has received only race reviews in the white press mr wright answers hellno to the question of whether richard wright had lost touch with the living american reality in his european exile however he does not think that the black writer should deliberately direct his work toward black audiences nor does he feel that the black writers journey toward art should lead deliberately through exploitation of the black experience as to whether there is a future for the idea of a black aesthetic mr wright says perhaps julian mayfield returned to the united states recently after several years in africa and europe an able novelist he has not been represented by a published work since his third novel the grand parade mr mayfield who is working on a new novel is a teaching fellow at cornell university perhaps surprisingly mr mayfield agrees that richard wright lost touch with the living american reality by remaining in exile and mr mayfield is one of the experienced authors who did not select richard wright as one of the three most important black american writers of all time he named w e b du bois james baldwin and ralph ellison in that order mr mayfield was tothepoint in his reply to the question as to whether the black writers journey toward art should lead through exploitation of the black experience a silly question of course what other experience is he the black writer going to have mr mayfield believes that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences even if they cannot persuade black people to buy writing by blacks to mr mayfield there have been no novels bv black writers worth mentioning since publication of invisible man to a younger more militant poet as a racist and a nazi because of the unadulterated hatred expressed toward white americans in the younger poets recent work the older poet points out quite logically that racism is just as stultifying from blacks as it is from whites and yet the older poet admits the power and beauty of the younger poets work without also admitting its poetic honesty the essential question it would seem is this are not black people in america systematically and literally murdered and degraded by white racism and arc not rage and bitterness and hatred perfectly natural and legitimate responses to this murder and degradation is the hatred of the jews for their nazi executioners merely equivalent to the germans hatred of the jews for their jewishness but back to the poll the second choice as most important black writer was langston hughes although the late poetplaywriglu edged out james baldwin and ralnh kllison bv only a few votes baldwin and ellison were evenly matched and web du bois had the next largest number of votes the third choice as most important hack writer was james r i f j t conrad kent rivers is a poet whose work has appeared in nearly all the recent anthologies of poetry by black authors sometime in the near future paul breman will publish a collection of mr rivers poems in london currently on leave from teaching duties in the metropolitan chicago area mr rivers is trying his hand at freelancing and intensive work on a major project the system of dantes hell by leroi jones is mr rivers choice as the most important novel by a black writer since invisible man and novelist ronald fair gets his vote as the most promising young novelist mr rivers feels that richard wright did lose touch to a degree during his exile but his techniques continued to improve is there a future for the black aesthetic idea yes the only hope we must create a black aesthetic must the black writer exploit the black experience to achieve art it is only through our exploitation of our experience that our vision and our ventures will ring true for the literate should black writers direct their work toward black audiences we must being there first our literature is our legacy if we fail to write for black people wein effectfail to write at all keorapetse william kgositsile is a refugee from south africa known affectionately as willie among his friends and acquaintances because it is difficult at first to learn to pronounce his name mr kgositsile has the advantage of being familiar with many african writers unknown in america but he also is very much a part of the contemporary black writers scene in america mr kgositsile does not believe that richard wrights work suffered because he had lost touch with the living american reality he sees other reasons why that work suffered believe that his wrights later works suffered because he became concerned with humanity instead of specifically black people humanity is a tricky abstraction and the establishment of a black aesthetic is the only future the black writer has in mr kgositsiles opinion there is no other way it could be if the art reflects and reflects upon the lives of black people the point of view of black writers is black and their experience as black people colors their ethics and aesthetics if they are honest people should the black writers journey toward art lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience through honest involvement with the black experience a writers language that is his images rhythms earliest memories and so forth come from his peoples experiencereal or imagined and art like clothing belongs specifically to a people and is identifiable that way should black writers direct their work toward black audiences yes they should they must unless they are schizophrenic l dont think the question even arises every selfrespecting artist addresses himself to his people rrooks and margaret walker was w mentioned most after jones as most important black playwright lcroi jones again received most mentions followed by lorraine hansbcrry and langston iimhes i the second choice as most important black playwright again was lcroi lone with langston hughes loften mitestci and the nigerian wole sovinka named in descending order the third choice as most important black playwright was lorraine hansbcrry langston hmihcs was runawav first choice as the most important black poet of the century with to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences poet margaret danner replied a writer should write what he feels and yet i believe that we should help each other if our talent is writing we can help in this wayby deliberately directing some of our work toward black audiences because of the predicament that the black man is in and faces those of us who are black should unite to extricate ourselves and each other do you believe that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience i believe and have tried for many years to do something positive about this conviction that the black should be awakened to his vast beauty he will then be so enthusiastic that he will automatically write of the experience and is there a future for the black aesthetic to the extent that this group includes those who have proven similar intentions by accepting and utilizing their help i feel that their exclusion of interested lovers of black is a hindrance jean wheeler smith is a detroiter who reversed the usual arrangement by making a life in mississippi her deep involvement in the civil_rights movement during snccs most dramatic days in the south had a lot to do with her making that decision and finding the strength to follow it mrs smith has published short stories and a moving autobiographical statement in a national women s magazine and she is now working to complete her first novel mrs smith does not feel competent to judge whether richard wright lost touch in his european exile never studied wrights works chronologically i think i read a range of his works though and to me theyre good over the years mrs smiths reply to the question of whether the concept of the black aesthetic has a future was refreshing im not sure i know what the term means i do think though that writing about things because theyre black and need to be recorded is legitimate for a few years and then later on a minor scale after the record has been made think the literature will have to be good just because it is good and makes its point that doesnt mean it wont still be about being black she believes the black experience should be exploited by black writers seeking art i think that the black experience has great historical and social significance for black and white people and it should be the focus of black writing where the writers temperament and background permit should black writers then direct their work toward black audiences yes anything you write for white audiences probably isnt going to do you and other black people much good except if you get get paid well for doing itwhich is another matter what you write for white folks is probably going backward or at most remaining stationary since all you can do for them is explain what already happened instead of explore new ways for things to happenor at least new ways and useful in the struggle of looking at what happened john wideman is a former football hero and rhodes scholar whose first novel a glance a way received generally good notices last fall mr wideman admitted that he is unfamiliar with that school of black writers which seeks to establish the black aesthetic and pretended not to know the meaning of the black experience he had not read richard wrights work and had no opinions on which writers and books were important explained mr wideman sometimes i havent sampled enough of the relevant writing at other times i just react negatively to any such popularity polls the only interesting aspect of opinion is the ground upon which it is based the skeletal history of preferences retains only an arbitrary hierarchy to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences mr widemans reply was a sharp one if thats the best they can do or what they want to do what about the future of the black aesthetic idea if by a black aesthetic you mean art and literature which is blackoriented i would say yes it has a future and l would say the word writers is too restrictive black creative artists i feel would more aptly serve as the black creative artist applies to his own works the discriminating standards of excellence by which he judges the works of others and as he remains involvedas do all artists with self and situation regardless of the manner of projection he will inevitably create a mystique in which excellence craftsmanship and blackness have interfused miss evans had some provocative things to say about black poets and craft if black poets share a fault it may be that we are through with a poem before it is crafted many black poets have excellent material but are evidently too impatient to wait for the results they could get this is true of aspiring white poets also but since being published is more of an achievement for a black writer the published work of a black poet is accorded a status it might not receive if he were white robert hayden is a craftsman leroi jones not only crafts but also has something to say and ted joans has a sincerity which transcends any weakness in crafting leroi jones i feel is important the other two are simply able poets as i see it should black writers direct their work toward black audiences some things should be said at home and some in the marketplace black writers should decide whether what they have to say needs to be said to white or black folks and attempt to market their work accordingly there are some other things whitey needs to be toldand some things the brother needs to hear there was a long period between publication of her poem for my people and publication of her novel jubilee when readers saw little of the work of margaret walker and she was missed apparently the poet had parceled her time among three important endeavors rearing her children teaching and researching and writing her long novel now she is being seen and heard again asked if black writers should direct their work toward black audiences miss walker replied in the affirmative who else can verify what is writ ten or identify with the work writers should not write exclusivlv for black or white audiences but most inclusively after all it is the business of all writers to write about the human condition and all humanity must be involved both in the writing and in the reading is there a future for those writers who want to establish a black aesthetic why not the black aesthetic r has a rich if undiscovered past this goes back in time to the beginning of civilization in egypt babylonia india china persia and all the islamic world that precedes the renaissance of the europeans we have lived too long excluded by the anglosaxon aesthic as to whether the black writer should exploit the black experience in the journey toward art miss walker was eloquent where else should the journey lead the black writer is the black experience how can the human experience transcend humanity its the same thingalternating desire for assimilation and separation but the division is both deeper and more subtle than that there are those writers who arc committed to the truth as reflected through the prism of their own experiences and of their total heritage and there are those writers who have adjusted their vision and their goals to the guidelines established by people who not only do not share with them crucial life experiences but who in effect are historically and culturally placed in a position which demands that the validity of the unshared experiences be denied all the writers polled here say that black writersand all writers should direct their work towards truth it is like coming out for god and motherhood but whose truth and who is to judge whether truth has been achieved clearly some of the w riters have set out on an independent course shucking the chains the literary young s e sam anderson is one of the few under writers who believe that richard wright lost touch with the livins ameriw can reality in his european exile a merica went through some very significant changes visavis black people and one would have had to be here to really dig upon the sophistication and institutionalization and acculturation of racism against blacks at home and abroad aesthetic what alice ch january negro digest the journey toward art mr anderson believes should lead through a conscious and deliberate exploration of the black experience real art is life or a mirror of life or an improver on life and since people are life and since they live in a society then art must be in our case black first and socially educational should black writers direct their work toward black audiences we are an oppressed people what is therefore needed is a revolution a revolution of self family society nation values culture the black writer including the cinema photographer radio dj and photographerjournalist must necessarily aid in the liberation struggle he cannot aid by talking black songs and programs to the enemy ofayswhites he must talk and listen and talk and help black people this will not only aid the liberation but also help perpetuate black art and humanistic art in other words in the process of directing his work toward black people he is creating a new man a new humanism unlike the pallid and selfcentered old humanism of the exploitive west ulia fields who returned to the south north carolina after living in new york city is a winner of a national endowment for the arts grant for this season the young writer believes that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences and this work should be at the service of the peopleart for the peoples sake it ought not to be schoolmarm stuff or dinner and a show stuff for unreffective bored people that leaves out the majority of black peoplea truly vast audience the real problem at this time ought to be how shall we reach black audiences miss fields comments on the question of the black aesthetic the negro caravan is read by people who have not heard of recent literature in the future the only relevant literature will be that a which has gone directly to the heart of blackness as to whether the black writers journey toward art should lead irected toward humanity which is indisputable but when humanity is interpreted as wearing a white face then what is the black writers alternative if the black audience does not constitute humanity then what audience does on page of this magazine is a quote from a review by louis simpson a white poet of gwen through exploitation of the black experience miss fields had some specific footnotes to add to her reply the black experience seems the most intense experience in the modern world it is better that black people write it ourselves rather than have it written for us exploitativelv the exploitatively is a reference to the three white writers miss fields selected as most important william styron robert penn warren and allen tate all southerners in excellent standing said miss fields by their good literary fortune they remind us that they are still assumed to understand blacks better than blacks understand themselves woodie king jr is a young playwright out of detroit now living in new york city and working through mobilization for youths with young people interested in the theater arts he is founder of the it is not generation january negro digest i t a i concept east theater in detroit where his first plays were produced and he once toured universities performing in malcolm boyds plays mr king also writes stories and is working on a novel mr king does not agree that richard wrights later works suffered because wright lost touch with the living american reality by remaining in europe he feels that wrights works suffered because he had money and security and did not live close to the lifeline in both europe and america mr king also feels there is a future for writers of the black aesthetic school because more black people are going to be reading because of the rise in education and the new leisure black writers should direct their work toward black audiences mr king feels he also thinks that john a williams the man who cried am is the most important novel by a black american writer since invisible man and that leroi jones is about miles ahead of the next living poet ernest j gaines published his second novel of love and dust last fall and will be represented by a collection of his short stories in the spring relatively unknown on the writers conference circuit he nevertheless is highly regarded by his fellow writers he lives in san francisco but wants to return to his native louisiana to research an important novel he intends to write mr gaines agrees with those who feel that richard wright lost touch with the living american exile by remaining so long abroad wright was a man of strong passionnot an intellectual he had to get his material out of the american soil not out of a european library mr gaines response to the question of whether there is a future in the black aesthetic concept as long as they black writers write about people people people people and not just about problems and should the journey toward art lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience ive always said that a man black writer or not should do what he can do best should black writers direct their work toward black audiences no more than french writers should the artist is the only free man left he owes nobody nothingnot even himself he should write what he wants when he wants and to whomever he wants if he is true he will use that material which is closest to him those people who have experienced much of what he the artist has will see themselves in his work if they dont then no amount of preaching by the artist will do any good robert boles background has been markedly different from that of most of the writers whose opinions are published here he grew up in the relatively more enlightened east traveled extensively under privileged circumstances and was removed by circumstance from the center of the racial w hirlpool in america and yet his published works show very clearly that he has not stood clear of the maelstrom his first novel was the people one knows and one of his stories appeared in langston hughes anthology the best short stories by negro americans later this spring his second novel curling will be published mr boles does not feel that richard wrights long stay in europe resulted in wright losing touch with the living american reality as to whether black writers should exploit the black experience in straining toward art mr boles is ambivalent dont believe that becoming a professional negro benefits art and one does not have to be one a professional negro to write about negroes the negro has enough working against himwhy should he limit his output to the black experience there are other experiences and he does not think that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences black writers should direct their work to the biggest audience they can find to their countrymen and to people all over the world to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences gwendolyn brooks replied no they should concern themselves with truth truth should be put upon paper that phrase direct their work suggests a secret contempt for the intelligence of the black audience her reply to the question do you believe that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience was the following i dont like the use here of the word exploitation but i believe that integrity essential and artistic will require not only involvement with what is known as the black experience but saturation does the famous poet see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic certainly a most exciting concept because definite because an entity because distinct gwendolyn brooks is the only black poet ever to be honored with a pulitzer prize she has published six books including one novel and recently delivered the manuscript of her seventh book the mecca to her publishers in new york a housewife as well as a distinguished poet miss brooks also has a full schedule as instructor at two chicago colleges chicago teachers college north and columbia college and also doubles as advisor to a group of young writers who meet regularly in her home her published works are selected poems the bean eaters annie allen a street in bronzeville bronxeville boys and girls for children and maud martha the novel like most of the writers polled miss brooks feels that richard wright who lived in chicago during her youth is the most important black writer produced by america in fact she does not feel he has any peers i am not intrigued by any novels written by black writers before or since native son she says like several of the older over writers playwright william b branch displayed a certain amount of impatience with the content and implications of some of the survey questions he declined to state an opinion relative to the questions dealing with most important novelists poets playwrights etc im afraid you lose me with all this most important jazz he said this implies a critical faculty and audacity im not sure i have or want to have asked if he believes the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience mr branch replied to each his own i for one think a black writer would be foolish to ignore the wealth of material and theme involved in the black experience but i would never confine anyone to it alone art is to be found ultimately in any human experience it depends upon who is doing the looking should black writers direct their work toward black audiences again to each his own though this has long been a subject of speculation and confusion i think ultimately each writer must be allowed to decide for himself there are some writing situations which would demand this others which would not some in which this would be an admirable opportunity others in which it would not m l think the schizophrenic aspects of a black writer in largely white america have been and still are a crippling load on an already overburdened entity perhaps he can solve this on an imwritingonlyformeandmypeople basis perhaps not know for me it is a dilemma l must wrestle with each time l try to write sometimes l lean more heavily in one direction sometimes in another hopeful that both black and white audiences will gain some though necessarily differing insight from what results all of this is complicated of course by the unfortunate fact that the black audience reading public book and ticket buyer etc is still a small and largely undeveloped group especially in the theater john o killens whose second novel and then we heard the thunder was one of the three novels listed as most important since invisible man sided with those who feel that the late richard wright had lost touch with the living american reality in his long european exile said mr killens think that a couple of his wrights later books such as the long dream reflected a loss of contact with the then black american reality nevertheless he remained to his dying day and to this day the greatest black novelist in the world living or dead despite mr killens opinion that wright had lost contact he still chose a wright novel the outsider as the most important novel by a black writer published since invisible man a ithough there was much in this novel did not care for in terms of bad writing neverthless the symbolism captured the black mans situation in american life as no other novel has before or after we are essentially outsiders in the land of our birth owing loyalties to no one but our black selves is there a future for the writers seeking to establish a black aesthetic yes believe that each creative writer must ultimately find that aesthetic which works best for him must find that rhythm that structure that style that idiom which the materials of his art and life dicate to him he ultimately becomes a slave to his aesthetic at the same time his aesthetic becomes the writers slave to be bent to his moods to be broken down from time to time and molded and forged into something new and altogether different at the whims of the writer and to suit the writers artistic purposes the writer is the ruthless exploiter faced with his aesthetic since the materials of most black writers come out of the black experience it would seem that a black aesthetic would be a most viable and fruitful one for the black artist but only if he continually seeks to reach the stage of a langston hughes or a charles white painter where he sees beauty in his be too gloomy a picture to bear with any kind of patience we are in a subservient position the smallest and the greatest of us we have cajoled pleaded tommed protested achieved rioted defied unified you name it but white supremacists have dug their heels into the ground and will settle for nothing less than outright confrontation in the streets of america welfare and poverty program are the white powers answer to our demand for freedom meanwhile we feed upon each other and hungrily pick unbuttered crumbs from massas table meanwhile we have no theaters or any other means of production and any attempt to buy our own puts us in the position where they can cut off our supply lines via unions and real estate holdings at a moments notice there is no artist among us whose individual success will free the rest of us there is no substitute for human rights not even art miss childress departed from the specific questions to speak with eloquence and passion about herself black people and america have ever been in the position of having to study and understand the greatness or meanness of others and of making whatever adjustment is necessary to exist in their world the oppressed forever studying the oppressor to be oppressed is hard but it is harder yet when one is expected to appreciate it the one who holds me down tells me how to react to his action in order to survive with his goodwill it is ever painful i do believe that the action of white supremacists have cut us off from the enjoyment and appreciation of the finest white artists and has benumbed the appreciation on ourselves as a peopleas a whole look to the white society which surrounds our ghettos a white child or adult who has been unloved by a parent neglected in some way or other must be nursed by psychologists for years in order to lead him back to a sense of well being my god what will it take for us to feel a fraction of that wellbeing after the hatred and attacks we have been subjected to for centuries the plaster now slapped on our wounds is welfare and poverty programwhich is another and more subtle attack this society tells us they would rather support us as charity cases than to open the doors and let us win or fail live or die as full citizens of this country if one lacks an appreciative attitude about this then you are bitter we can be bitter or numb there is no other choice a negro without feeling numb seems to survive a few moments inoger than we who are bitter as to who are the most important white american writers miss childress had the following comments i doubt if i am capable of summing up the best and the greatest food served at other peoples tables i remember best what has somewhat slaked my thirst and eased my hunger pains people who pity us leave me cold i dont even feel like evaluating walt whitman and i know he was different and new to a great extent and belongs in the company of thoreau there was only one john brown and one elijah lovejoy but then they werent writers were they addison gayle jr is one of the few contemporary writers who wins the approval of both the revolutionary and the conservative wings of the black literary world an instructor of english in the prebaccaulaureate program of the city college of new york mr gayles articles and stories have appeared in a number of periodicals mr gayle is emphatic in his disagreement with the contention that richard wrights later works suffered because of his long exile in europe wright lost some of the pow er displayed in native son in his later novel the outsider but two of his most powerful works white man listen and eight men were written abroad however mr gayle does not see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish the black aesthetic the black aesthetic has always been a part of the lives black people to investigate these lives and the conditions surrounding them is to reveal an aesthetic inherent in the soul of black people nor does mr gayle support the idea that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience do not believe in the journey art must always be subordinated to truth and that truth no matter how uncomfortable can not be denied by adhering to romantic criteria proposed by critics who have no cognizance of truth and less of life on the other hand mr gayle does believe that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences serious consideration however must be given to this question perhaps this is where black literature should have first directed itself perhaps wright was wrong in arguing that black people knew about the conditions under which other black people lived and that the w riter should therefore importune white people to listen one may editors undoubtedly since white america goes out of its way to make the black man negro feel that he is a part of this country this melting pot why indeed do we need the word negro why do we need ghettoes poor schools substandard housing workless fathers unpublished poets and other accidents of the melting pot and if this melting pot does exist why did blacks get burned so badly mr hayden what are television radio movies newspapers and weekly news magazines if not ideological weaponswhite ideology twentyfour hours a day at every conceivable level white concepts are inforced and reinforced upon black people what we do not need mr hayden is people like you telling us what we need the editor continues his drive against blackness with this assertion a belligerent race pride moves these celebrants of black_power to declare themselves not simply poets but negro poets i would say a belligerent ignorance moved mr hayden to make such a statement such an ignorance enabled him to use a term like black_power which clearly shows that he has no concept of white power or even of selfpower for that matter an ignorance that should realize that those celebrants of black_power are really in essence celebrants of self of a people of me and yes mr hayden celebrants of you and few if any would reduce themselves to defending a tired overused cliche like black_power obviously the editor is not only out of touch with black poets but wishes to antagonize them by calling them negro poets no such animal when used in that frame of reference exists most if not all of the black poets writing today contend that being a negro is only a state of mind ie just like negroland the editor counters with words from one of the first widely read negro poets countee cullen in which mr cullen states that he be considered a poet not a negro poet for he did not want to be restricted to racial themes nor have his poetry judged solely on the basis of its relevance to the negro struggle first mr cullen and mr hayden continue to perpetuate a very dangerous myth in that they presuppose that poets other than black poets or black critics are qualified to judge black or negro poetry i believe that this is an absurdity to say the least how can one who is not a part of our culture a part of our immediate life a part of us judge us how can they wasp have a proper perspective to work from if there is to be judgment then we as afroamericans are better prepared to pass judgment on them we blacks have a much wider perspective to work from for we are the products of a dual culture ie shakespeare during the day and leroi jones at night or americanism during the day and survival at night and to john henry you taught us that a man could go down like a man and to you sterling brown you taught that in poetry the people their lifestyle their language and their culture should not be forgotten arna bontemps who is best known for his prose leaves little doubt in my mind to the validity of his poetry he is lyrical and his poems denote a musical quality langston hughes who left us in may of shows that he is still alive i believe that hayden errs in telling us that mr hughes at his death had the distinction of being the only american negro man of letters able to support himself by writing if i am not mistaken james baldwin has this distinction also langston hughes being one of the most important writers of the century could and should have been better represented i too and jazzonia lead the sad array of his poems i have recently completed his the panther and the lash and know too well that the editor had much more to select from the emasculated countee cullen as one would expect if one was under the influence of robert hillyer john keats and a e housman emasculates most of his poetry even with these handicaps cullens feeling comes through in for a lady i know she even thinks that up in heaven her class lies late and snores while poor black cherubs rise at seven to do celestial chores a shade of light were the poems of frank m davis his sarcasm was biting and left pains try arthur ridgewood md he debated whether as a poet to have dreams and beans or as a physician have a long car and caviar dividing his time between both he died from a nervous breakdown caused by worry from rejection slips and final notices from the finance company i also liked robert whitmore and giles johnson phd of robert haydens poems frederick douglass moved me most owen dodson and margaret danner will be heard dudley randalls booker t and web is printed here which contradicts something dudley once told me about having poems printed and reprinted in anthologies the forementioned poem was in beyond the blues edited by rosey pool margaret walkers for my people continues to stand out as does her lineage and molly means gwendolyn brooks one of my favorites displays her work with all the irony and surprise that is only hers she has a downtoearth use of images and an easy flowing rhythm i espe dally liked negros hero and hunchback girl she thinks of heaven james a emmanuels poems are tight and full as in the negro never saw him never can hypothetical haunting man eyes asaucer yessir bosssir dice aclicking razor flicking theness froze him in a dance aness never had a chance mari evans continues to play with words beautifully naomi madgett and g c oden are ably spoken for as is oliver pitcher ted joans voice in the crowd captures the true meaning of the poet if you should seea manwalking down a crowded streettalking aloudto himself dont runin the opposite direction but run toward himfor he is a poet you have nothing to fearfrom the poet but the truth calvin c herntons young negro poet tells a good story as does his madhouse gerald w barrax and conrad kent rivers are worth reading and rereading leroi jones one of the few black poets in this book is not properly represented most of the poems are from an earlier transitional period and do not reflect his blackness as i am sure leroi would have wanted it mr hayden says that mr jones is an advocate of art as protest and propaganda and he favors the cultivation of a black art which would reject white aesthetic values first if i may be so bold to speak for jones leroi advocates an art of and for the people ie art for peoples sake he also believes as i do that black art in its purest form will not only educate entertain and elevate but will instill in the people an awareness of self jones believes in bringing black art to the people and in essence bringing them survival survival as a people and as a culture he rejects pure imitation and brings about new standards new values new art ie black aesthetic values mr hayden also states that much of jones poetry is in no legitimate sense racist or propagandist this is to say that some of jones poetry is racist etc etc etc i find that statement racist and thats going some for a negro jones poetry is black which is problack propeople proliving ie protomorrow the editor feels that jones poetry is favored by the nonacademic poets does that mean that he is favored by poets ud and me are running j so fast that the two i f birds over neds head kztksis are slowin down in the sky and now they are passing behind the low cloud which must be the one sprinkling these few rain drops on us but we are still running faster than the drops me and cud they know where the devil is at cud is ahead because he aint afraid of the devil but i am and we are running along the fence and cud is leaping over i am sliding on the little slope beside the fence catching myself on the leaning old fence post pulling up and then i am standing high on the fat fence post looking at cud as the big hole in the seat of his overalls shows his black skin and his legs roll away over the field ned is standing near the stump waving at us like he found the greatest secret in the world and am standing higher on the post puffing stretching out my arms like a bird so that i can see if i can see the devil beating his wife if i can see from here i am staying here i am a waterfall flying off that post and i must be a river because the fence is shaking and trembling and snaking like the dead trees did in the stream when we were fishing a waterfall can put out the devil in a hot hell so i am running faster and then the sun stands on top of me and then hides his head again and you should see my shadow leap away from the side of myself just like when i was swinging from the oak limb on cuds rope yesterday and higher and higher and im gone look at ned but i am looking only at cud when he slows down whats he slowing for he must see something ned stops waving me on if i really see this devil im gonna be scared of everything for the rest of my life but cud he sees something and he keeps seeing it and now hes waving and it is my turn to see but i am slowing then i am running faster and faster as the sun comes out over the center of the field like a fat pillar of golden air and the rain is catching up with me and i can see it on the grass and feel it climbing over my muddy bare feet cleaning the stink off hurry blue you missin it man what they yelling me on for they see im coming and while im coming i strain to see what they see but i dont see nothing but the sun shining down from the sky and the dark field all around shaking in the wind and the rain striking across the light and on the grass i slide and i am there look ned is crazy they dancin cud he crazy too he leans in on the stump squinting at two figures like little carved dolls on top of that old stump its an old stump rotten and a hole is right in the center the rings for age are around that hole which is a rot hole and the rings are like little ditches splinters and twigs stick out of that stump but not like the two figures dancing in the light around the center hole and when i see it i close my mouth shut then my mouth drops open on its own and i feel the rain spirits soaking into me and cud is whispering a little and am shivering because the sun was hot but now it is raincold and the little dolls on the stump are dancing faster i see the devil dressed in red swinging a whip around his head snorting smoke when a rain drop strikes striking the other on the back the devils wife is dressed in white and the devils wife is falling and she falls into the hole but she catches the edges of the stump and the devil pulls her up and gets on top of her and i am watching him straddle her and then i hear a scream and the wind is slashing me with rain sun is gone just like that and in the field i am alone cud and ned are racing away yelling and when i look at the stump only the twigs dance in the wind slow back and forth growing bigger and bigger as the sun flicks off and on off and on clouds running and both of them are getting taller and taller giants with hands so big that the fingers are reaching for me now and then i am stumbling over my legs leaping with my heart which i can feel driving a river all over my body and i fly they are way ahead of me and i dont know whats in back of me and dont see anything but the devil chasing me and at home i am puffing out everything watching cuds eyes and neds eyes when we all climb on the back of papas wagon which papa is driving into the yard and i know its my turn to feed the mule but i still am puffing when papa gets down and thats my papa he knows everything yall git your chores did fore it start lightnin i am puffing and cud and ned climb down but i cannot stop puffing and papa hears me puffing and i cant talk because the devil is still chasing the road and i point into the sky where the sun is setting and where the rain is still coming and going my papa dont care nothing about it and he is saying boy that aint lightnin and i am still puffing and then i have to get off the wagon and they all looking at me rainin and sunshinin at the same time says ned and he whispers something to cud who dont say nothing except work his mouth and papa says rain under the sun you stick a pin in the ground and put your ear to it and you can hear the devil beating his wife we know it says ned i tell my papa i know it and my head is nodding up and down up and down dizzy and i have to say it i have to say we didnt hear the devil beating his wife this time because we see him do it and my papa is looking at all of us he is going to holler at us but he dont because he sees something maybe over our heads he sees him coming and maybe out of my eyes too raining and i have to tell him but i dont right then how come he beating her i ask my papa is unhitching them mules and we all around him and he tells us the truth and the truth is because it is raining and sunshining at the same time the rain spirits are coming strong now and my papa he says ah you got to do is to stick a pin in the ground or a stump and put your ear to it and you can hear the whole thing now yall git and do them chores but we are standing there dripping which is a lot of rain by now and i feel a river rising up in me and i see cuds eye and cud he looks at ned and ned he looks at me and i am licking my bottom lip with my tongue tasting the sunny salt in the rain and i am going to be the first to tell him im going to tell my papa we see the devil during the first half of the s there were no events that mirrored the utter impoverishment of negro creative intellectuals so much as those publicized glamorous meetings that go under the imposing title of negro writers conferences these literary conventionsinblackandtan are without a doubt the nearest thing imaginable to those congressional talkfests in washington d c where every elected representative knows it is his bounden duty to be presentfor the record but only for the record because no one has any intention of passing one bit of positive pending legislation this is another way of saying that negro writers conferences settle nothing solve nothing pose nothing analyze nothing plan nothing create nothingnot even a decent new literary reviewwhich is the least any bunch of serious selfrespecting writers with a gripe ought to do these conferences are comic parodies on the serious substance and reality of negro life which negro literature is alleged to reflect they are engineered by leading writers who when they are not sweating over the manuscripts of secondrate protest novels are chafing at the bit for a dialogue in public with white liberals and the metropolitan press but the inconoclastic nonparticipating observer at these conferences has to wonderwhy these writers who have the unmitigated gall to pursue a dialogue with whites cannot monitor even a positive selfcritical dialogue in john o killens and the harlem writers guild staged such a conference under the auspices this time of the new school for social research in new york in there were two writers conferences one in april staged by killens and his literary group and one in february by the american festival of negro arts at fairleigh dickinson university the latter represented a radically dissident outgroup neither of these conferences can be fully understood unless one is explained in terms of the other and both have to be interpreted in terms of another organizationthe american society of african culture this background also takes in the controversy of several years standing in american negroafrican relations over the philosophical and aesthetic concept of negritude the cultural mystique considered applicable to all peoples of african descent the american festival of negro arts afna conference was the direct result of a split from the american society of african culture amsac this split came about when amsac hedged on carrying out satisfactorily the parent bodys implied cultural program among american negroes relations in amsac had been festering since about and finally a rival movement of international prestige splintered offf the killens group remained inside amsac and afna came on the scene in conjunction with the emergence of the new young negro creative wave in new york many of these young negroes who attended the afna conference were not invited to the killens conference the uniqueness of afna its readiness to deal with negrowhite cultural fundamentals both ideologically and institutionally was indicated by the fact that the afna affair was not just a negro writers conference it attempted to deal also with painting music the philosophy of negritude literary criticism and enlisted the participation of africans interested in the negro cultural image the conference was administered and projected by the cultural independents and the young generation it was not wellattended yet was a publicrelations and institutional success representing a solid and substantial new direction its discussions and deliberations were orderly mature most of the time intelligent critical and probing and educational it foreshadowed the cultivation of a new literary and cultural critique among the younger negro creative intelligentsia by contrast the much more crowded sessions at the new school in april saw the killens literary and cultural entourage approaching the end of its yearold reign this conference was painfully frenetic and pitifully rhetorical attempting to analyze the negro writers cultural precariousness in american society and the fate of the american negro in american culture as a people here the crisis of the negro intellectual was acted out in vivid detail with truetolife players mouthing lines and speeches they had rehearsed for years all the ingroup members were there with representatives dating back to the heyday of harlems committee for negro in the arts at the new school was represented the whole left traditionfreedom newspaper harlem writers guild association of artists for freedom inc freedomways magazine american dialog with its echoes of masses and mainstream and for good measure shades of political affairsthe communist partys official theoretical organ the leftwing literary elite was in full control in a desperate bid to reestablish its status within the stream of the new cultural and literary trends the new school conference was staged in memory of the departed lorraine hansberry with the exception of the poetry panel every other panel was policed by one member or two of the harlem cultural ingroup thus the literary cultural and other opinions of killens john henrik clarke sylvester leaks alice childress sara wright william branch ossie davis and ruby dee in absentia and lorraine hansberry through her exhusband robert nemiroff dominated this writers conference james baldwin not originally a charter member of the group was nevertheless the literary lion of the performance but not in the eyes of the ranking members of the exharlem leftwing elite next in order of importance on the panels came certain whites of leftwing literary and critical fame like herbert aptheker and walter lowen fels we shall see in this writers conference how the radical left continues to wield its influence over negro writers the new york times said of the new school conference they hissed and hollered and debated one another for about seven hours yesterday sunday april and when it was all over words laterthey could not agree on much of anything but that is the way it was supposed to be free and flailing in the course of yesterdays program james baldwin was called a literary prostitute the new york times was condemned for covering harlem like a police beat and the national broadcasting company was chided for offering a talented negro playwright a job as a janitor the conference might still be going on now if the moderator allan morrison of ebony magazine had not simply stopped the show but not before he himself had been criticized by the audience both white and negrofor suggesting that perhaps some negroes are not now sufficiently qualified to take advantage of all the opportunities open to them in the creative and communications fields of movies theaters television and journalism a young woman named myrna baines called mr baldwin an extremely talented literary prostitute the truth is however that the total conference was not all chaos and confusion there were many papers readsome historically informative eloquent and pointedsome anecdotal trite rhetorical and superficial but the discussions around these various papers became emotional and intellectual bedlams several of these papers posed problems and conceptions raised questions and suggested directions which the panelists could neither debate nor pursue to any definitive conclusions the conference led the participants into unknown and unsurveyed regions of black and white cultural reality but once there killens and his faction were able to give not one modicum of intellectual or programmatic leadership the problems of negro writers in terms of craft content and opportunities integrated jobs in the cultural media have been taken up over and over again but these are individual problems when the real substance of what negro writers are dealing with but cant pursue is the group cultural status of the american negro ethnic group the future individual status of the negro writer is predicated on this group cultural status if the two sides of this question are separated the negro writer continues to be what he always wasa craftsman taking his chances as an individual running after whatever support and patronage he can get wherever he can find it even in the communist partyand often selling out what principles he has if any to maintain himself the harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite did precisely this they were all launched as writers by the political leftwing which gave them patronage and support in harlem and beyond through leftwing connections in publishing theater and the broadcasting media some of them actually got more support than their individual talents really merited they were awarded prizes and jobs profitable marriages and social contacts which furthered their careers now they come before the public in writers conferences pretending to be leaders in intellectualcreative thought who are going to advance the negro movementpurely on the strength of the dubious example of their own selfadvancement the emptiness of these pretensions was soon revealed when conference panelists demanded to know where do you go from here what is your plan do you have a new program killens literary faction had no answers when a conferee demanded i want to know how are you going to get this cultural message to enough people to make it effective when most of the people dont read novels what other forms are you planning on using killens answered i would like to redirect the question and ask the whole audience what are you doing because when we write you know it is going to be up to you to help us get to you it is quite a bit to ask the negro writer to write this thing and figure out how it is going to get to you i think this little exchange between negro writer and audience shows clearly why writers conferences are worthless another participant asserted i would like to suggest that the novel is a useless form of art for the urgency of the problem confronting the negro americans specifically and in my own particular case the problems confronting me most important is my urgent desire for freedom first of all end the novel all these people on the panel were talking about the directness that a person should have this young lady novelist said she was not interested in writing a novel about the bourgeoisie in her society she was interested in writing a novel about the poor man unfortunately you are not a poor man but there are some negro writers in america whom this conference has entirely overlooked one of whom spoke in this auditorium at ten oclock this morning saying that i came here to destroy western civilization in effect not to let a ford be a car that i build new parts on to make a jet plane but to offer a jet plane that is different than the thing itself i am talking about poetry and the directness of the people who are in the streets of selma or all over the south and the young people whoi dont know whatbut it is certainly more complicated than sitting for two years at the typewriter and knowing something about a family unit john o killens had no response to this and sylvester leaks the chairman of this panel said all right we accept your statement ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming we must adjourn now roughly thirtyfive negroes in the literary arts the media and the press including the leftwing elite members took part in the conference added to these were several white writers and critics of the negroes interestingly enough there were only seven at the new school conference who had participated in the afna conference in february they were writer and critic wilmer lucas poets samuel allen calvin hernton and gloria oden and playwrights william branch loften mitchell and ossie davis of these seven only samuel allen had figured personally in the amsacafna split as one of the leading founders of amsac and as the only ranking amsac spokesman who did not boycott the afna conference various other writers who had participated in the afna conference either were not invited or did not appear as panelists at the new school conference what is happening here in all this tentative crossing of lines sorting eliminating and jockeying is that the decline of amsac and the emergence of afna has left killens faction without the influential base it once had within amsac these conferences actually reflect an incipient cultural power struggle within the new york representatives of the negro creative intelligentsia involved in this burgeoning struggle are several factions the literary and cultural left the literary and cultural nationalists the oldguard and the new the unaffiliated negro literary establishment in the universities and certain negro publications behind these lie the crucial issues of africa and the afroamerican image in the arts at the very root of the problem are philosophic and cultural implications of negritude as propounded by the society of african culture in paris and africa interestingly enough while the afna conference had a panel discussion on negritude the new school conference did not at the final session of this latter conference dr john everett president of the new school said of the affair in some ways i have been dismayed by it and in some ways greatly heartened i am dismayed by the fact that the white intellectual community obviously does not know of nor does it have any real comprehension of the vitality and the true strength of the negro intellectual community this has been for me consequently a dismaying experience the dialogue that should be going on between the white intellectual community and the negro intellectual community obviously has not been going on it is one of the functions of the new school to see that this dialogue proceeds and continues the good president had ample reason to be dismayed but he is no doubt a liberal and was being quite kind and maybe even sanguine yet most of what happened at the new school was not a dialogue but a frustrated diatribe a dialogue demands a cultural methodology that these negro writers do not have and that the whites cannot give them a cultural methodology must be predicated on a broad grasp of the totality of cultural factors in life which these writers have never possessed for dr everett to suggest a continued dialogue between negro and white intellectuals means that such a dialogue must proceed on one and the same level with both whites and the negro community however killens group was already blocked from this kind of dialogue by the very presence of the apthekerleft and the ideology it represents the new school conference could not separate literary art as content theme and form from the material basis of cultural expression ie the organizational and administrative nature of the cultural apparatus which has to be treated separately to indulge in analogy these conference writers behave like a bunch of defenders of morality protesting a certain residence being used as a whorehouse instead of a sunday school when the residence is owned operated and built by a professional madam such a situation would suggest a twosided strategyhold the sunday school elsewhere and in the meantime wage a fight by any means possible to oust the madam from ownership of the residence but these conference writers want to hold their sunday school in the madams house while the girls are working on other days besides sunday a whorehouse by any other name is still a whorehouseeven if it is integrated thus these conference writers want to join the prevailing cultural superstructure of america while protesting its standards and values under the misapprehension that the injection of their values whatever they are alleged to be can change that superstructure this is ridiculous no one can hope to change americas cultural standards and values unless the proprietorship the administration and the uses to which the cultural apparatus are put are changed to allow for more democratic social control it is only on this basis that there can be any dialogue between the negro and the white intellectual and it is only along this methodical route that the white intellectual can be prodded and challenged into taking a stand on social change the white intellectual will never take this position on his own because there will always be some establishment posture and privilege he will want to defend be it anglosaxon supremacy the jewish intellectual mystique or the assimilationist worship of the wasp ideal in the cultural arts that there are some blacks participating in this latter category can certainly be deemed a source of ideological confusion for all concerned this very schizoid ambivalence is what befogs the clique consciousness of the writers who staged the new school conference most aptly this conference was dedicated to the memory of the late lorraine hansberry for indeed ideologically she was the groups inspiration and her literary and aesthetic ideals are theirs consequently not a mumbling word that smacks of criticism of hansberrys work will ever come from this group for that would be tantamount to criticizing themselves they could never admit that thev have been accepted by different establishments mostly on the basis of inferior work or that they are talking out of both sides of the mouth projecting the afroamerican image in literature as negro writers today and tomorrow switching images a la hansberrys brustein yet swearing that they are still projecting the black image just as if everybody were truly colorblind sylvester leaks opened his panel discussion with a paper titled the failure of the black writer a most brave and intrepid declaration considering who was listening and watching he then proceeded to criticize not a single negro writer by namepresent or absent the topic of the panel was what negro novelists are saying however the first person to speak on this panel was lorraine hansberrys husband robert nemiroff not previously listed on the panel of six nemiroffs only reference to the subject at handnegro novelistswas that his late wife had started a novel that would not be published this panel opening up the dam of confusion seemed to establish an approach designed to forestall any threat of serious criticism of any literary ingroup member hence with the exception of the blasts at ellison and baldwin nothing emerged but bland critical platitudes and impersonal generalizations at one point killens delivered his prepared assault on ellison herbert hill newly blossoming literary expert on negro affairs acclaimed ralph ellison for all the wrong reasons because ellisons work according to mr hill transcends the traditional occupation of the negro writer well now mr hill aside from the insufferable paternalistic arrogance of this statement let us take up this question of the mainstream and face the fact that it contains some rather sickly fish from top to bottom killens obviously thinks the literary mainstream rather polluted unless one of course enters either from the left or from the urbanite at the time of freedom newspaper however the word mainstream had not come into vogue rather it was negrowhite unity plus socialist realism john henrik clarke also got in his blows at ellison i particularly wanted to take up with mr hill this continued love affair with ralph ellison who is standing outside of his peoples struggle making olympian remarks about how that struggle should be conducted hill who is the naacps labor secretary replied i would categorically deny that by the way i am sorry that we dont have a chance to discuss mr ellisons work i would simply challenge that point of view clarke i hope mr hill can be brief with this exaggeration of the role of ralph ellison who has spent so much time in the last years in flight from his own people and has not even answered most mail addressed to him by his fellow black writers and has said positively that art and literature are not racial he wont come into any afroamerican writers conference i think ellison wrote one very interesting thing from the point of view of craftsmanship it was a very good and powerful work whether ralph ellison will follow up whether ralph ellison has grown up is open to question in many quarters starting with me let me say that i do not see how any intelligent person not committed to a previous bias can read invisible man and affirm that mrellison stands aside from the struggle for racial justice in the united states i am not authorized to speak for mr ellison he speaks very well for himself enter herbert aptheker i just wanted to say that i assume mr clarke has read ralph ellisons book and probably many in the audience have and i have also the invisible man was done about years ago clarke nineteen fiftytwo aptheker it is unfortunate that mr ellison is not here i would say that his work since the invisible man even though he is not here and i prefer not to talk that way in his absence but in terms of what he has published and also his published assertions he has made himself rather not particularly visible in the struggles of the negro people clarke i want to take the qualification further than that i think dr aptheker put it correctly i was referring to the last years and the last years when baldwin took flight and went to paris hating himself and his people literally but did come back and enter the mainstream of the struggle whether he is psychologically back home completely opens maybe a question but at least he knows the road that leads to home but mr ralph ellison seems to have been going further away from home in that sense we can see now that the killens group in a precarious situation these days cannot attack ellison on craftsmanship or even content any more as killens did on freedom newspaper because none of them has written anything even remotely comparable to ellisons achievements hence they must assail him on the question of participation in the struggle and the fact that ellison once stated that art and literature are not racial but clarke forgets that lorraine hansberry their great mentor said precisely the same thingraisin was not racial it was not a negro play it was about americans at the writers conference sponsored by kittens group and amsac lorraine hansberrys paper was not about negro writers problems but about the decadence of such white writers as tennessee williams and others nobody protested that her remarks were not racial nothing was said until after this conference when hansberry scandalized the leading lights of the harlem writers guild by declaring that negro writers are retarded that raised some ire however even if ellison did express the view that literature and art are not racial as clarke insists the evidence remains that all of ellisons work as exemplified in invisible man and shadow and act is definitely racial i would rather believe that ellison expressed this view in when he refused to attend the amsac conference in order to avoid being involved with kittens whose freedom newspaper review of invisible man ellison had every right to resent on more than political grounds moreover ellison never went as far as miss hansberry did to show all concerned that she truly believed literature and art were not racial the literary leftwing has always functioned on the principle that some negro writers are more privileged than others but there is much more behind this clarkekillens attack on ellison than comes out kittens has a personal literary stake in all this which clarke does not moreover kittens leftwing background precedes that of clarke by several years the truth is that the racial leftwing will never forgive ellison for writing invisible man no matter what ellison does or does not do about the struggle thus for clarke to chide ellison for refusing to attend any afroamerican writers conference is naive in the extremeespecially conferences run by all the leftwings favored negro writers with political axes to grind in the presence of the leading white communist party theoretician and historian on the negro moreover there would be little value in ellisons attending a killensled conference unless permitted to discuss socialist realism and negro writing on the left but there are no pasternaks among these leftwingsponsored negro writers thus in both kittens and julian mayfield refused to allow a debate at the amsac conference on the influence of socialist realism on the freedom of negro writers since ellisons writing career on the left precedes that of kittens ellison knows much better than clarke what happens to negro writers on the left who refuse to submit themselves to the standards of socialist realism clarke who is not really a creative writer never had to cope with this question ralph ellison does not owe the left anything since the left did not make him as a writer hence ellison is not morally obligated to support any struggle or any negro writers conferences initiated by the left let the leftwing writers clique in the harlem writers guild get their own house in order and beamed in on reality they have no right to demand that other writers fall in line behind them because the struggle is larger and broader than they are with more ramifications and complexities than their limited imaginations can encompass let them remember that there are still writers functioning today who long ago assumed their writers prerogative to tell the radical left you people do not understand the black peoples dilemma in the united states what has happened to those writers but note how obediently john henrik clarke the africanistafroamerican nationalist mouths every twisted hypocritical ambivalence of the leftwing integrationists in killens group hill was right when he intimated clarke was critically moved by a previous bias in the same killens crew decided that frank yerby was no longer to be considered a negro writer having joined wright baldwin etc in paris to rewrite new versions of the foxes of harrow that got whiter and whiter would clarke put ellison in yerbys category he would but clarke ought to go back to the may issue of urbanite and read the last paragraph of lorraine hansberrys article there he will see that in her mind frank yerby was in the same category with charles white leontyne price lena horne harry belafonte james baldwin john killens nina simone paul robeson langston hughes julian mayfield odetta p j sydney eartha kitt and pearl bailey they were in her words a band of angels hurling forth the art of twenty millions well this was miss hansberrys opinion and clarke should take note of the multicolored witches brew of ethnic imagery comprising this list of candidates for high honors in the field of racial identity john henrik clarke is to be respected for one thinghe has never equivocated on his pride in being black and africanesque today however it seems clarke has been placed in a most awkward and degrading ideological position he has to defend and play secondfiddle to certain johnnycomelatelys whose black pride in literature and art is turned at will according to its cultural marketability instead of attacking ralph ellison clarke should have been asking for some clarification from herbert aptheker as to what aptheker meant by this statement thus the components of what veblen saw in the intellectual preeminence of european jews and what ashley montague saw in the natural superiority of women and what karl marx saw as the saving quality of those who labor all are present in the american negro men and women one does not have to move from these opinions to perverse distortions leading off into insidious nationalism but one should see in these opinions additional suggestions towards understanding the centrality of the negro question notice that aptheker did not ascribe natural superiority to the working class but only a saving quality no longer even a revolutionary quality however apthekers paper propounded what he calls the superiority of the american negro in the abstract mass concept aptheker used to view the negro people across historical vistas as a beautiful untarnished and noble folk struggling for equality these were the ingredients of that peculiar genre of leftwing romanticism in negro history writing that historical stream continued unbroken from nat turner and denmark vesey to sojourner truth from john brown and frederick douglass to w e b dubois and herbert aptheker and ultimately to the communist party but this abstract mass concept was applicable only to apthekers brand of writingso easily translated into dogma to most negroes in the flesh he was quite arrogant today this peculiarly inverted racial attitude holds the negro superior a patronization carried to its ultimate dogmatic degree for political purposes for a black muslim to say this doubtless would bring from aptheker the charge of reactionary race chauvinism similar to his own attitudes to the garvey movement the new school conference was valuable in that it demonstrated clearly the limitations of a conference composed only of writers rather than practitioners of all the arts this conference revealed that negro writers are struggling under severe illusions intellectual handicaps and many societal and cultural misapprehensions about reality as david boroff pointed out whether intentionally or inadvertently the negro writer is up against the real ascendancy of the jewish writer and artist in a country of white anglosaxon protestant dominance in every field but the creative and cultural for david boroff to admit that the white anglosaxon creative impulse is just about dead might be news to some of killens group but in truth it has been on the wane ever since its last spurt in the s since that time jewish writers and artists have not only filled that particular creative void they have also preempted a considerable portion of negro thematic material both in literature and in the field of social science studies during the s when the anglosaxon creative artist was still fecund and original there was much anglosaxonjewish collaboration especially in the theater the late lorraine hansberry condemned the stereotypes of a porgy and bess far more significant is the fact that this great symbol of the negros secondclass status in the cultural arts was a product of jewish and anglosaxon collaboration civilwriters however like lorraine hansberry will be very careful to limit their charges of literary paternalism to writers like the frenchman jean genet far removed from the home ground where native wasps and jews have been battening off the folk for decades both in literature and music as a play the blacks does not touch the heart of the american cultural problem moreover it is in a class by itself as theatrical literature in terms of its newer quality and form it shows up writers of the level of the killens group as rather pedestrian parochial uninspired unimaginative latecomers to the s tradition of protest and pure realism now when baldwin killens hansberry and others have finally caught up with the s the jewish writers are doing something else hence the killens group stands helpless albeit vocal before a situation in american culture whose historical derivatives they do not comprehend yet they themselves unwittingly played certain purblind roles in the recent history of this cultural development no one can much blame negro writers for drifting leftward in culture and politics at some point in their individual careers but once they do too many either become captives for the balance of their intellectual lives or else are ultimately disillusioned if not expelled and drift into a negative kind of isolation or exile few of them ever seem to learn anything positive about reality from this experience the radical left of the s and s was not a movement of anglosaxons or their ideology it was an ethnic movement dominated by negroes and jews and it was the jews who ideologically influenced the negroes thus the radical left in america has developed in such a way that the jewish ethnic group one of the smallest in the country had more political prestige wielded more theoretical and organizational power than the negro who in fact represented the largest ethnic minority consequently all political and cultural standards on the radical left were in the main established and enforced by jews for and on negroes this negrojewish state of affairs was paralleled outside the radical left as well in the civil_rights organizations one can explain this development rationalize it excuse it condemn it or uphold it call it negative or positive but the fact remains that it was ethnically undemocratic more important it has retarded and smothered the negros intellectual and political development on the cultural front it has prevented negro writers and artists from grappling in a creative fashion with the underdeveloped cultural status of the negro within a multicultural and multiethnic society the negro has been boxed in politically economically and culturally he has been unable to improvise on another groups standards and rules of playing the game on the other hand many negroes have developed their own brand of laissezfaire acquiescence to the status quo these writers did not realize they were limiting the range and the scope of their own talents so bent were they on making it nor did they see through the cultural ruse being perpetrated on them and the cultural paternalism and control exercised behind that ruse herbert apthekers tumultuous praise for william branchs play in splendid error in masses and mainstream went unchallenged no one would admit that it was actually a bad play that happened to be about john brown and frederick douglass thus praiseworthy as an historical civil_rightsprotest play leftwing jewish writers however were not writing this kind of a play one of the big theatrical hits of the time was the world of sholem aleichem a dramatization of the jewish folk writers stories and certainly no protest play the killens group were very impressed with this example of creative jewish theater artmainly because ruby dee was given a white role to play as an integrated casting giftthis was the great achievement john o killens summing up of the new school conference was an exercise in literary and cultural doubletalk he took no stand on a single question of literary principle simply paying lip service to all points of view on that intangible called universality while killens did not openly say he favored the blackoutsidewhiteinside literary school or the i am just a writer who happens to be a negro stance of james baldwin and others he did make the following revealing comments but most of the writers that were here this weekend seemed to be askingdoes art have any nobler purposehas art ever had any nobler purpose the question kept being raised on the platform and from the audience and it reminded me of sidney brustein and the sign in sidney brusteins window the question how the how is important i should say the how is damned important how do we reach the ears of the negro people of our country note the flicker of the twinimage the negrojewish identityexchange motif of the hansberry dramatic saga referred to by one who has always maintained that he was never in doubt as to who he is and what he is as a writer i am a negro writer said killens and my materials are basically the negro people but after all is said and done killens must still peer from the outside into sidney brusteins window to find out how to reach the ears of the negro people the new school writers conference demonstrated without a doubt that the former harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite are possessed of an intellectual literary and creative ethnic duality they refuse to admit taken as a whole they are neither white black nor jewish but an amalgam of all three unless the negro creative intellectuals as a stratum can evolve creative and artistic policies that will govern cultural programs organizations and selfsustained and administered research institutions they cannot achieve cultural democracy against the competitions of white andor jewish intelligentsia america today is a cultural desert strewn with the corpses of commercialized commodityart where sweet voices sing lullabies of cultural degeneration its aesthetics are antilife its images those of lunacy and the propaganda of destruction in america the political power and economic status of the white anglosaxon are considered ample compensation for the nations lack of cultural prestige imposed on it by wasp rule in this void the jew has played a manysided role as the ethnic middleman of culture whereas the negro has been a mere commodity on the cultural market to be bought out sold short sold out or else frozen out this situation cannot long endure if this nation is to haul itself out of its own internal mire and rehabilitate its image in the eyes of the world the negro creative intellectual has a potentially powerful role to play in this process if he can master a literary and cultural critique reorientation which it is doubtful the oldguard negro writers of the new school writers conference can achieve new younger more willing and imaginative creative forces are needed back in wallace thurman wrote a novel in which he satirized the negro artists and writers of the s negro renaissance one of the characters complained that the average negro intellectual and artist has no goal no standards no elasticity no pregnant germ plasm after praising only one negro artist of that time who had the elements of greatness the character observed again the rest of us are mere journeymen planting seed for someone else to harvest we all get sidetracked sooner or later the older ones become warped by propaganda we younger ones are mired in decadence none of us seem to be able to rise above our environment wallace thurman called his novel infants of the spring yet in over years the negro writers of the new school conference the former harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite have not really advanced much further than the negro renaissance writers in terms of ideas if the s negro writers were infants of the spring the present elite are adolescents of the long hot summer they are intellectuals in a crisis but a crisis occasioned not merely by an inherited backlog of unresolved history but by the fact that they are not truly intellectuals by any historical and cultural definition this is one mans reaction to a damn good book harlem is a very expensive piece of real estate bounded on the east by the east river and on the west by the hudson river and on the north by white folks and on the south by white folks it is many things to many people it is the neighborhood el barrio to some it is the jungle to so many others it is moreover a colony on the mainland of the mother country and the country is a mother right the last of the great white mothers stepmother dig it down these mean streets alfred knopf is a book about the neighborhood an autobiography a couple of years back my son wrote to me dad as walk through the negro neighborhood i suddenly realize that the negro ghetto is not a ghetto it is home it was a revelation that shook me to my hominy grits langston hughes of course knew it all along he never bought the jungle bit to the great man it was home sweet home bitter home loften mitchell always knew it but white men designated it as the jungle and the jungle it was to many black folks conservatives and radicals and all the variations in between moderates liberals militants many of whom lived in the neighborhood all of their lives unharmed physically but were scared to be out after dark because the man had called their home the jungle dig called it the jungle thereby creating the image of a place where only beasts and savages abided save for a few courageous white men missionaries mercenaries and such who ventured into the jungle at their own peril to christianize the savages and bring them progress and glad tidings of the wondrous blessings of civilization according to the script the priest the explorer the merchant were the good guys always and forever repeat if the man says it is the jungle then of course it must be the jungle existing only to be exploited for its raw materials its people but comes the native insurrection when the costs of exploitation become prohibitive then the jungle must be destroyed along with the beasts and savages who dwell therein and most of the great stories depicting the jungle written sometimes even by black would you believe colored writers have been in essence all about how i lived through my jungle days and made my escape to civilization and transcended my cultural deprivation and wrote a best seller about it meaning if i did why not you why not every man down these mean streets is an autobiography written by piri thomas a black puerto rican who looked upon east harlem not as jungle but as el barrio the neighborhood his neighborhood home not a ghetto but home he was not always a black puerto rican that is what the core of his story is about one mans lonely journey to his blackness it is moreover because he possessed the artistry to make it so the universal story of the manofcolors journey to his selfhood his identity piri thomass parents were of course from puerto rico his mother was visibly white but was blacker in her psyche than his father who was black visibly but who was for the most part in full flight from his blackness piri was the oldest child in a family of seven children the oldest and the blackest and thereby hangs a significant aspect of his journey to identity through most of his young life he loved his father even though he felt a sharp rejection from him much of which he attributed to his and his fathershigh degree of visibility poverty alienation disenchant ment gang rumbles love discrimination sex dope addiction robberiespiri thomas journeyed down many and varied mean streets in a searchofdesperation for his manhood selfhood most of these mean streets turned out to be escape hatches ephemeral as a tornado and equally as devastating elusive as a willowisp some were deadends pure and simple there was a stint in the merchant marines an abortive stickup in a downtown manhattan nightclub a sixyears stretch in prison all the beautiful ugliness of life is within these pages down these mean streets piri was a man in motion in a perpetual state of war against the formidable windmills of establishment and these mean streets do not stop at central park they go with piri and his black and afroamerican brother all the way to galveston texas where he does a thing in a white hotel with a white whore who thinks she is making it with a spanish cat then i stepped in front of the mirror and put my jacket on the broad was still on the bed wondering if i was going to make her again when walked to the door she smiled and said in broken texas spanish did i like it and did i want more i opened the door and said baby i just want you to knowand i watched her smile fall off and a look of horror fill the empty space it lefti just want you to know i repeated that you just got laid by a nigger by a black man and i didnt wait to hear her gasp or to watch her jump out of the bed i ran i disappeared because i learned a long time ago to hit and run right back to the turf and my turf was that goddamn ship the characters in this book are many and varied fleshandblood and nittygritty people the language is real and fresh and true for the most part it is a gutsy idiomatic blending of puerto rican and afroamericanese dig it mean streets has a terrible beauty a work of art it is a fine job of writing feeling living moreover it is a book that breaks with the tradition of most books written about harlem about all the harlems of the usa harlem is not the ghetto in this book for ghetto is yet another european word formulated out of contempt for the inhabitants of the ghetto in the american context it is another word for jungle in the good old usa it means that any neighborhood inhabited solely by black men is ipso facto an inferior place too many black folk have bought this view this definition of every black community this image of the black mans capacity for nationhood for neighborhood if you will for black community hood having accepted this negative view of blackness and black potential this for many middle class black folks has meant a lifetime of running away from self and selfhood it is time far past time brothers and sisters to stop running and come on home come on home and affirm your dignity and your manhood here they are no place else but here with us security for black folks even middle class black folks is rooted in el barrio in unity with the black masses supreme court appointments appointed mayors of washington etc notwithstanding your true strength must come from us from blackness all else are mere tokens of ol massas affection and whatever of massa giveth he can damn sure take away bless him so come on back home to the turf the neighborhood and help to make it all of these mean streets a fitter place for human habitation this was brother malcolms vision this is the last clear chance for your salvation come on home brothers and sisters and let us together take charge of our community and rid it of the lecherous gringos and we will create our own definitions of ourselves and our communities we will designate them all anew is wherever black men live the ghetto or is it the neighborhood the turf home what is the word in afroamericanese for el barrio come let us reconstruct the neighborhood in our own black image weve often wondered in the dim caves of our jealous heart just how fair it is to ask a trying to be writer to give an appraisal of a first published effort by a real writer would the fangs of hurt sink so deeply that a wounded animal would shriek its pain across the page called looked for spelling errorsfaults in book review its very important to consider the source before accepting the word and we would like to assure the reader that if we could have found fault with the flagellants farrar straus giroux we would have we read it twicewe sentence structureanything we were so upset by not finding anything that we read it again for its hate content it is small and the print is such that our weak eyes sent a sighful prayer to the black madonna for realizing that colored people like big print and warming the white mans heart to make him give it to us there are two minor white women in the story of ideal and jimson and we looked and looked to see if miss polite had been unduly prejudiced again we must report that she was fair much nicer than perhaps we would have been had they messed with us like they messed with ideal then we went to jimsonand we believed every black woman has had her jimsonto see if he was treated with the proper respect due a black uncastrated man jimson was not as fully developed as he could have been but he was as fully developed as he should have been for miss polite takes both the black man and the black woman to their naked selves beyond even the black skin all the way down she takes us into the black bones with all unnecessary organs removed down into back bones with only black hearts raw nerve endings a black thimble inside the skull holding the required responses and the black organ that is a delicacy in southern states presented only after an involved ceremony to the purest and truest of southern ladies she puts these to us in her novel and it hurts not because she creates sympathy it is too late for either to deal with sympathy not because she creates guilt guilt has no meaning for black people but because it is so near a truth we hope it is not the truth for if the black man and the black woman must leave each other to be happy and fulfilled people then we are damning untold generations to hopelessness and we would not deny a truth because it hurts but we cannot accept the separation of the only true human beings as the answer to their and our salvation nor would we force a unity of black delicacy with black hallow just for the sake of unity anything for anythings sake is nothingness and in the process of natural selection a panther may play in a field of sheep he may run and jump and do many delightful things but when the dinner bell sounds and the hunt begins he will join the other panthers in making a meal of the ewe and the ram who objects will be put in his place miss polites novel is excellent reading her style is very definitely her own and the style is a part of the story telling there are dreams and images and feelings that all merge and flow with back flashes to her past and forebodings about the future it becomes clear to ideal that she is being abused not because jimson doesnt work isnt a poet or a man but because he no longer loves her and will not allow her to go at a point of happiness he cuts the fruit from the vine at its overripe state and forces ideal to drool for the sweet juices that once were hers while watching the maggots fornicate on it and multiply neither ideal nor jimson is strong nor are they weak they are simply one black man and one black woman trying to find the sweet black life it was denied ideal and jimson it need not be denied us all the flaggelants describes beautifully a relationship in a given period it may well become one of the major novels of the sixties it is an enlightenment and we heartily recommend it we would like to remind our readers that we give this praise under the strong protest that we didnt write

somebody on the ins side said once that i g politics is the art of the possible but for saemsm the ack outsider in america politics in america has been the art of the impossible it has been the art of the impossible because it has been the art of trying to make a fundamental change in a political system by using the structures and instruments that were designed to perpetuate that system it has been the art of the impossible because it has been the art of trying to make a social revolution with moderate tools that were invented to prevent social revolutions it has been the art of the impossible because of the nature of politics which is the art of making some things impossible for outsiders and because of the extremity of the black mans situation which cannot be changed unless all things are made possible because of the black mans situation which is radical by any definition and because of the nature of american politics which is moderate to conservative by any definition the black man in america has been condemned to seek radical ends within a political framework which was designed to prevent sudden and radical social and economic changes for almost years now the black outsiders of america have been squirming within the halters of this maddening dilemma during this period the representatives of the outsiders in the councils of the insiders have made striking gains as individuals but black people as a group have not been able to change their status and their social and economic conditions with political instruments and the question we must grapple with now is whether it will ever be possible to achieve fundamental social and economic change by the practice of politics as defined by the insiders the question nowand the question is radical because the times are radical and because our situation is radicalis whether politics is relevant to our contemporary crisis which cannot be resolved without political programs of a depth and dimension never before attempted in america is the old politicsthe politics of deals and trades and patronage the politics of place and privilege and individual advancementis the old politics relevant to the issues of bread for the millions and housing and education for the poor is politics relevant to the question of the redistribution of income and resources and the restructuring of the fundamental institutions of this society is politics relevant to black reality beyond all that beyond the specific problems of black people we must ask whether politics is relevant to white people is it relevant to the emptiness and hysteria and the unresolved social and economic problems in the white community can the old politics create white individuals who will not need racial scapegoats to solve their social and economic and sexual anxieties watts and newark and detroit put these questions on the agenda of american life in a very real sense these rebellions were devastating critiques of the american way of politics in rebellion the black people of america said that they were voting more and enjoying it less in rebellion the black people of america said that politics in america has failed them and that it is necessary now to create a new politics that can address itself to the real problems of this profoundly racist society it is against this background that we must view the question of the black mans role in american politics and in the light of these events and the history these events reflect we must say frankly that black people have no role in american politics black people are the outsiders the disinherited of the american political system as human beings they live outside white america in numerous black colonies and as voters and political persons they inhabit the margins on the periphery of the system even the persons who represent these outsiders in the councils of the insiders occupy a marginal positionas the adam powell and the thomas dodd cases indicated from time to time the inhabitants of these black colonies have played crucial roles as pawns of persons inside the system more significantly they have crucially affected the system by their presence on the periphery in other words they have acted on the system from a distance indeed one might say that the political history of america is a series of approaches and withdrawals from the pressing reality of the black outsiders on the margin in summation then the role of the black man outside american politics is the dual role of a political pawn for insiders and a protagonist from the outside of the whole political system in considering this dual role we have to deal with what j d b miller the political theorist calls the politics of the center and the circumference we have to deal in other words with a wwcolonial relation as kenneth clark noted in his book dark ghetto the dark ghettos are social political educational andabove alleconomic colonies their inhabitants are subject people victims of the greed cruelty insensitivity guilt and fear of their masters these colonies are controlled politically from the outside ultimate policymaking power lies in the hands of aliens who have their own representatives many of them black on the spot with power to see that the will of the white center is obeyed in the black circumference we must note also that the inhabitants of the center and the inhabitants of the circumference do not deal with each other directly black people and white people as gunnar myrdal noted deal with each other like two foreign countries through the medium of plenipotentiaries i say this with bluntness to emphasize the fact that when we talk about black politics we are not talking about ordinary politics and we are not talking about ordinary politics because the american political system has not created a single social community in which the reciprocal rules of politics would apply conventional politics cannot solve this problem because conventional politics is a part of the problem it is a part of the problem in the sense that the political system is the major bulwark of racism in america it is a part of the problem in the sense that the political system is structured to repel fundamental social and economic change we hear a great deal about the deficiencies real or imagined of certain black leaders but not enough attention it seems to me is paid to the framework within which they operate that framework prevents radical growth and innovationand it was designed to prevent radical growth and innovation what we have to deal with here is what arthur schlesinger jr called the paradox of power the fact that power within the system is necessary to do certain things but that power within the system makes it impossible to do most things when john f kennedy became president he was no political novice but he didnt realize schlesigner tells us how beautifully the government structure was organized to prevent anything from happening from the very beginning the american political structure has been beautifully organized to keep anything from happening we need not deal here with the theory that the constitutional convention was a conspiracy against the revolutionary ideals of the declaration of independence but it is obvious from a cursory examination of that document that the founding fathers were animated by a desire to protect property and privilege from sudden social experiments the theory of checks and balances for example is based on the theory that privilege must be protected from people thomas jefferson a large and wealthy slaveowner protested against the antipeople biases of the new government but he did not prevail and additional safeguards were later built into the system to protect the rising in dustrial directorate one of these safeguards of course was the twoparty system which was designed in part to filter out radicalism and to force dissent to express itself within two moderate channels insofar as the black man is concerned one can say of the two parties what a political insider said to lord bryce they are like two bottles of the same size the same color and the same shape with the same labelboth of them empty the criticisms i make here of politics in america could be extended to most political structures certainly of most political structures in the west governments cannot operate without support which means in practice that they must identify with certain interests in society and this means in america that government has usually identified with the interests of white people nothing illustrates this better than the central events in the political history of the negro contrary to the generally accepted idea that history began not in slavery but in indentured servitude the first black immigrants in english america landed at jamestown in august they came these first black men and women the same way many perhaps most of the first white men cameunder duress and compulsion they found a system which permitted poor people to pay for their passage by working a stipulated number of years as indentured servants in virginia then and in other colonies the first black immigrants fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic groove which carried with it no implications of racial inferiority during this transitional period of years or more a period of primary importance in the history of america the first black immigrants mingled with whites on a basis of substantial equality black and whites worked in the same fields lived in the same huts and fraternized in the same places some perhaps most of the first black immigrants worked out their term of indentured servitude and were freed within a short time they were accumulating property pounds and indentured servants the record indicates that these black settlers were accorded substantially the same rights as freed whites they voted in eleven of the thirteen original colonies and some of them became the first black officeholders in america by filling the minor posts of beadle and surety all this changed dramatically with the opening of the new world and the introduction of sugar planting in the west indies this new situation created a demand for men that could not be satisfied by the casual kidnapping of poor blacks in africa and poor whites in europe beginning around the leading men of the colonies passed laws that made black people servants for life this was a fatal and perhaps irreparable break in the sense of community between black and white americans it was the starting point the first turn on the road to the summer of and the dangers beyond this ominous decision was later made a part of the charter of america at the constitutional convention where northern delegates gave in to southern threats and wrote slavery into the constitution within a few years slavery had become a cancer in the heart of the american political system with incalculable results that are still re sounding in the streets of america today during the whole of the slave period black people had no political history in the narrow sense of the term political but it is impossible to understand the political history of that period without reference to the black man although black men were disfranchised in both the north and south black people voted in every election influencing the political process by their presence and by the cause they embodied some black people voted with their feet by escaping in the tens of thousands from the south others acted on the political process as nonviolent abolitionist demonstrators it is a matter of record that great black abolitionists like frederick douglass and henry highland garent participated in the founding of the liberty and free soil parties both of which were forerunners of the republican party still another form of political action for the slaves was violence as evidenced by the nat turner rebellion of when all these currents linked up with that great american agitator yankee selfinterest the stage was set for the civil war emancipation and reconstruction it was during this period that black people came onstage and spoke lines in their own name for the first time and it was during this period that the seeds were sown for the political crisis of today the period began with a promising political revolution largely as a result of the radical political vision of two republican leaders representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senator charles sumner of massachusetts the freedmen were enfranchised and federal troops were sent into the south to protect them in the exercise of the fundamental rights of american citizens with the passage of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and a civil_rights act which was a great deal stronger than the act passed in reconstruction came to a legal climax but this legislation so similar to the legislation of our day only touched the surface of the problem no one knew this better than the freedmen who saw clearly that it was necessary to complete the political revolution by a social revolution and what this meant in the context of that day was forty acres and a mule thaddeus stevens an old white man from pennsylvania who was the most powerful politician in washington and who was perhaps the most relevant politician in the political history of black americans made a valiant effort to give the radical reconstruction program the economic thrust it lacked but he was thwarted by the paradox of power after repeated attempts to push a radical land reform bill through congress stevens announced that the dream was stillborn he had fondly dreamed he said in a house speech that when any fortunate chance should have broken up for a while the foundations of our institutions and released us from obligations the most tyrannical that ever man imposed in the name of freedom that american institutions would have been so remodeled as to have freed them from every vestige of human oppression of inequality of rights or recognized degradation of the poor and the superior caste of the rich but alas he said bowing to the inherent limitations of the system this bright dream has vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision the failure of that dreamthe refusal of the political leaders of america to ground political freedom on economic freedom doomed reconstruction and paved the way to our present crisis before the curtain that lifted for a moment dropped black men and their white allies carried the south and the black man to heights of democracy that have not yet been equalled in this republic during the heyday of reconstruction from to black men served in the legislature of every southern state and in south carolina during this period black men had a majority in the legislature in every session save one black people also sent representatives to the house of representatives and two black men were elected to the u s senate from the state of mississippi there were also treasurers secretaries of state and superintendents of education in mississippi south carolina louisiana and florida and for a brief period the brilliant black politician p b s pinchback served as governor of the state of louisiana despite mistakes which were inevitable under the circumstances black people made large strides in renovating the political structures of the south people who say that black_power is simply white power in blackface ought to think long and hard about the reconstruction period black people had considerable power in south carolina mississippi louisiana where they constituted a majority of the population and a majority of the registered voters the record indicates that the black reconstruction governments gave poor and middle class white people rights aristocratic whites had denied them not only that black people in perhaps their greatest contribution created in the south what had never existed before a public school system supported by public taxation perhaps the most important development of this period was the expansion of the political horizons of black people since politics was real since it was an activity that corroborated reality and promised to change reality black people gave to politics the kind of attention their children and grandchildren would give to entertainment and religion black people lived in that faraway and mystical period in a primary relation with power they turned out in the thousands for political meetings and they followed politics day by day month by month throughout the year reconstruction was a supreme lesson the right reading of which might still mark a turning point in our history for years in this country for months men tried democracy black people and white people married each other in the southand the world did not end little black boys and little white girls went to school togetherand the confederate dead did not rise did not in fact make a sound at all although the klan said they were turning in their graves all over the south in these years blacks and whites shared streetcars restaurants hotels honors dreams the sun rose and the sun set and the constitution of the united states had some meaning from maine to mississippifor years reconstruction was a lesson first of all for black politicians it demonstrated clearly the need for bold honest and imaginative leadership and it established beyond doubt the black mans right to participate in power on the debit side it can be said that many of the black leaders of reconstruction were too anxious to prove that they could live up to the anglosaxon idea they were too anxious to prove that they could do what white politicians could do even more decisive was the failure of the black leaders of reconstruction to mobilize a black_power base and to remain in close touch with the cottonroots of their constituencies too many men then as now were living too far away from the people they said they were representing we need not concern ourselves here with the myth of corruption men used to overthrow these governments the black leaders of reconstruction were not overthrown because they were corrupt they were overthrown because they couldnt shoot in a very significant failure of the american political system the reconstruction governments were overthrown by an open and violent revolution and this open and violent revolution was legitimized by the compromise of a political bargain which gave rutherford b hayes the presidency in exchange for a suspension of constitutional safeguards which protected black voters in the south backed by every structure of power in the north the south pushed black people back towards slavery by a white terrorist campaign which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people and this campaign of terror was sanctioned by the supreme court which sucked the meaning out of the fourteenth amendment and invalidated the reconstruction civil_rights laws black people protested they organized protests and called on the president but nobody was listening and nobody really cared the democratic party was openly hostile then and there was no real alternative for black people who continued to vote republican out of habit and out of despair black people were driven from power in the south by terror and fraud but individual republicans managed to hold on to power for several years in several states and black voters sent representatives to southern legislatures and congressmen to washington until the dawn of the twentieth century as the years wore on the area of black expressiveness narrowed and by world war i it was considered subversive for black men to hold public office the violent overthrow of reconstruction set the stage for the great migration to the north which began around and continues today like the various immigrant groups black people were soon organized into political machines but these machines were composed of mutually hostile groups pursuing a politics of patronage and stalemate within the boundaries of this situation black people could veto openly hostile policies but they could not translate voting power into fundamental group gains as a result black people were penetrated by feelings of political powerlessness since politics had no relevance to their agony since it was not an activity with which they could lift themselves they began to look on it with indifference worse some black people came to see politics as a marketable activity involving the trading of votes for petty political favors for all that political involvement brought some gains at least to individuals in oscar de priest inaugurated a new era by becoming the first black congressman from the north and the first black congressman in america since the turn of the century de priest was elected as a republican from the first congressional district of chicago six years later arthur mitchell became the first democratic congressman by winning election from the same district after black politicians republican and democratic were elected to the legislatures of most northern states and the border states of kentucky and west virginia they also filled elective or appointive positions in the public service of every major city the disaster of the depression widened the political alternatives in america and with the coming of the new deal black people deserted the republican party and gave their votes and their hearts to the politics of the welfare state after world war ii and the internationalization of the race problem the political horizons of the black community widened there was a new and ominous restlessness in the black community and negro protest organizations began to mobilize mass pressures the government responded to this new mood by intervening dramatically on behalf of black americans in the fifties and sixties a series of supreme court decisions and civil_rights acts reopened the national compromise of black people began to vote again in substantial numbers in the south and in the south and north black people were named or elected to unprecedented political positions by it was possible to speak of the beginning of the second reconstruction this period of political growth brought striking gains particularly in the black middle class but the record shows that black people as a whole lost ground relative to whites in the rate of unemployment for negroes and whites to use president johnsons figures was about the same thirtyfive years later the negro rate was twice as high to continue with the figures president johnson cited in his speech at howard university in the eight per cent unemployment rate for negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites by last year the rate had grown to per cent as against per cent for whites between and the income of negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country from to the median income of negro families compared to white actually dropped from per cent to per cent since the number of white families living in poverty has decreased per cent while the number of poor nonwhite families decreased only per cent the infant mortality of nonwhites in was per cent greater than whites twentytwo years later it was per cent greater moreover the isolation of negroes from white communities is increasing rather than decreasing as negroes crowd into the central cities and become a city within a city this is a record of failure despite political success and it has led to a general crisis of confidence in the fairness of the american political system a voteless people a national fraternity used to say is a hopeless people we know now from the example of chicago and watts and detroit that a voting people can also be a hopeless people and i think it is incumbent upon all black americans in the light of this knowledge to rethink their relation to american politics i have suggested here that conventional politics is designed to prevent fundamental change i have also suggested that it is impossible to meet the fundamental needs of black people without a social revolution if these hypotheses are correctand i offer the whole history of america as evidenceit is incumbent upon us to either revitalize conventional politics or abandon conventional politics a new politics is necessary in america because the old politics has failed us and the salvation of the black man in this country and the creation of democracy in this country depend to a very great extent on the creation of a new political vision in the black community we must make a radical reevaluation of all our traditional political alliances in the light of the needs and the interests of the overwhelming majority of black people black representatives must dare now to redefine themselves in terms of the interests of their people they must ask themselves who they are and who they really represent and if their ultimate allegiance is to the black community and not to the democratic party or the republican party or labor or some white political boss they must dare to make that allegiance real by creating independent power bases in the black community at the same time black people must assume responsibility for the financing of the campaigns of black candidates they must come together as a group and provide independent bases for a new and independent politics the most urgent need of this hour is the political education of black people they must be made aware of their political and economic interests and the general nature of the opposition beyond all that it is necessary to make black people recognize their unity with others in the same situation it may be necessary for some people to operate as democrats and republicans but black people should realize that their real need is results not names the socalled alienation of the urban black voter is based i suspect on a very sophisticated analysis of the american political system black people by and large dont believe politics can bring about a realthat is to say effectivechange in their basic situation if the black masses are to rise to the requirements of this hour they must be shown that politics is their affair and in their fundamental interests bayard rustin has said that the civil_rights movement must become political i would add that the political movement must become a civil_rights movement i believe the relevant black politician must carry off the difficult feat of blending the traditional political skills with the skills of the reformer it is encouraging to note that this process is well underway in michigan for example a black mayor threatened to resign over a human rights issue and when the political process failed in wisconsin black officeholders redefined their roles and went to jail another indication of this same process was the skillful talkin staged by illinois legislators i believe it will be necessary in the future to extend this process for years white politicians have used the whole range of parliamentary weapons to deny black people human rights it is time now i think for black officeholders to use the whole range of parliamentary weapons in a nonviolent campaign within the political process this would be a service not only to black americans but also to white americans for black people embody the most advanced social and economic interests of this society and action on behalf of their interests is action also in behalf of the real interests of whites today as in black people embody the truth of the declaration of independence and the mission of the black politician is to do what white politicians have failed to do define and actualize liberty and equality as a faith and a way of life in the final analysis as emmett john hughes pointed out the art of politics is the subtle and sensitive attuning and discipling of all words and deedsnot to mend the petty conflict of the moment nor to close some tiny gap in the discourse of the daybut to define and to advance designs and policies for a thousand tomorrows and that is the historic mission of the black politician today the advancing of designs and policies for a thousand tomorrows for blacks and whites born as smoke still hovered over the rubble of the nations worst not detroits militant federation for selfdetermination at first seemed fated to help prevent future confidently its members fires proclaimed themselves part of the new black establishment this establishment included fiery black nationalist minister rev albert cleage jr bearded college radicals graysuited intellectuals and grimeyed activists from the socalled black underground and suddenly rev cleage and the others were everywhere urging black control of the black community on scores of television programs and haranguing sweaty crowds at dozens of emotional unity rallies that was last fall this past spring as gunbuying continued at an alltime high in both the suburbs and city the federation quietly expired its demise was vaguely attributed to the desire of members for new alliances and to work on individual projects actually a combination of forces had sapped the groups strength lack of financial support probably was most damaging to the federation but internal feuding clannishness and fogginess of purpose all contributed to its decline most observers here agree more significantly detroit contributed incredible rumor after incredible rumor concerning the aims of black nationalists was swallowed whole by a white community hungry for scapegoats the rumor kept alive most persistently in the suburbs was that black guerrillas planned to invade outlying areas this summer and kill the firstborn in every family but most whites were wellprepared for them it has been estimated that about onethird of suburban dwellings contain some kind of firearms and that new permits for hand guns will be issued in the metropolitan detroit area this year the white communitys generally belligerent response to the disturbance of last summer is credited with increasing the federations difficulty in obtaining needed support from white industrialists politicians and foundations and disenchantment with the liberal white establishment was apparent during the federations final cut and dried meeting the meeting had been delayed nearly two hours as the groups mostly youthful membership straggled in after huddling in little knots in the hallways rev cleage was over an hour late but once seated his face carefully blank he became the focal point of eyes it had been his dream it had not withstood the stresses from both within and without there were few moments of drama no peaks of excitement to the meeting with no particular inflection to his voice lorenzo freeman federation vicechairman stated that the board of directors after reassessing the groups purposes had recommended that it be dissolved a motion for dissolution then was proposed by young attorney kenneth cockrel of the association of black students it was quickly approved a hint of the conflict said to have plagued the group suddenly flashed into view like an ugly word scrawled on a wall members voted down a suggestion that the federation retain a skeleton structure that would bear its name and solicit funds in the hope of the groups eventual rebirth they opted instead for legal dissolution if theres ever any need for us to come together again we will one young man flung out but the process of dissolution was well underway before the april meeting at any rate wayne state universitys dr karl gregory had resigned as executive director in march at that time it was revealed that the federation had little over in its treasury dr gregory continued to offer his services to the group on a voluntary basis but this alone could not reverse the dark course of events a person close to the organization blamed its collapse on the industrydominated new detroit committees failure to offer financing without strings they had an opportunity to make this a meaningful movement he said now all that has happened is that the real militant movement in this community has gone back underground if the aims of the federation are not realized it can only be blamed on those who failed to make available the necessary funds for its operation the federation spurned a grant from the new detroit committee after the committee decided to fund a moderate negro group as well and stipulated that the federation cooperate with this group yet this was not the sole cause of its troubles a young militant bitterly spoke of the lack of integrity and the personal ambitions of those who had the responsibility of making the federation operative anyone who questions the integrity or possible lack of it in individuals within a group of course is on shaky ground but it is a fact that certain members of the federation doubted the dedication of other members in private conversations it was alleged that a member of the board of directors was continuing to receive his salary from another job while being paid by the federation it was further alleged that another officials financial irresponsibility helped deplete the groups already scanty funds people outside the group complained that it was clannish and insular the same little clique always runs the whole damn show snorted one woman who has been prominent in activist causes a disgruntled federation member alluded to the same issue during the final meeting maybe the problem is this organization has been too much us here and not enough the people out there another problem may have been the groups lack of a clearcut program for action the stress going instead to calls for black solidarity black consciousness and black pride selfdetermination was a goal yes but any new complex of ghettocontrolled cooperative apartments and supermarkets would have required the initial support of white industrialists the only major activity sponsored by the federation during its short span was a malcolm_x day memorial which raised for malcolms widow so for whatever the reasons detroit faces this years long hot summer just as illprepared as it was last year the big rumor stalking the streets of the ghetto is that armed white nuts will provoke an incident leading to a riot so that they can destroy the inner city presently no group and no individual stands as a buffer against these fears the glaring vacuum of leadership exposed by the insurrection of has not been filled as the detroit contingent of the poor peoples march discovered recently when they were trampled upon by mounted policemen downtown no one took up the cause of the poor and no one is capitalizing on the acceptance of a militant approach by many middleclass negroes meanwhile many black people are looking forward to a bigger and better rebellion this summer according to a recent survey by prominent local psychiatrist dr paul lowinger i am not looking for any oversimplified answer to the question who am i it is obvious by now that i am not going to be a great white american dancer but i have little patience with people who suggest that to be a black choreographer one must limit his scope and deal exclusively with traditional afroamerican material the question of an artists identity is one that he continually asks he asks it through his chosen medium by experimentally probing into different aspects of his identity and environment whether one functions as a choreographer who also happens to be black or as a black man who happens to be a choreographer is determined by his point of view at a given moment the ideal point of view at any given moment for the individual artist is the one which best allows him to create the most profoundly exciting art if he cannot produce beautiful and exciting art there is no point in discussing his political or ideological commitments in relation to art the militant black revolutionary may think of art in terms of the whole machinery of the revolution as a means of bringing forth the rich heritage of the african in america and to create a sense of identity for the sake of the revolution most of the existing dance companies which are the instruments of black choreographers have placed their emphasis on traditional afroamerican material they are exploring through their artistry the proud afroamerican heritage and they can evoke poignant images which will encourage intolerance of racial suppression but these images are not the only means of communicating a black consciousness while traditional black art is playing a vital role in the awakening of a black cultural identity now it is equally important for black artists to discourage the crystalization of new stereotype limitations by not confining themselves to oversimplified traditional images i am not suggesting that black artists should or could cut themselves off from afroamerican tradition artist or layman our past experience inevitably affects our articulation of present ideas but if an artists individual sense of immediacy is to vitalize his work he should have freedom to decide which ideas he feels a need to communicate at a particular time artists have felt compelled to create images which called for social changes long before their own people were ready to initiate them otherwise one might never be moved to focus his art on sociohistoric events it is not a question of art for arts sake it is a need to be true to ones own feelings though masterpieces have been created on commissionwith the idea of fulfilling some sponsors visioninfinitely more poor art has been produced by artists who were working with ideas about which they had no deep feelings an artists assumption that he knows exactly what his audience needs often results in art that is at best patronizing the highest compliment an artist can give his audiences is to invite them to witness his exploration of the maximum possibilities of his art based on his total experience the dance that i do is afroamerican simply because i am afroamerican my blackness is part of my identity as a human being and my dance exploration is evolving in relation to my total experience as a man it is simply a question of what is more important in the act of creatingmy total living experiences or those experiences which i consider particularly relevant to my blackness the myth that afroamericans function well only in certain predictable areas is one that both white and black americans have long been conditioned to accept and it must be dispelled the black artists refusal to confine his work to convenient categories will contribute to the destruction of this limited notion each dance i create has grown out of my personal experience as a black american each movement i explore is part of my own personal heritage my emphasis is on exploring through my medium experimenting with dance trying to find fresh ways of evoking physical and spiritual images to make new poetic comments about mans eternal beauty and pathos my function in the revolution will be to share my personal experience through dance a vital and growing experience not to show only old stereotypes or to create new ones james frazier is a yearold detroit musician of more than exceptional ability and promise last spring in a singularly important musical event mr frazier conducted the detroit symphony orchestra in a performance of the difficult beethovens ninth symphony the event was heralded with great pride by musicminded detroiters who had watched the young man develop from a student of local music teachers to a confident conductor already known on two continents for as a matter of fact mr fraziers march stint before the detroit symphony orchestra was not his first four years earlier he conducted the orchestra in a full program of beethoven ralph vaughn williams strauss and rachmaninoff at ford auditorium the occasion marked a first for a black man in michigan in june he won a special award in the international conductors competition at liverpool england where he was the youngest contestant during that same month he also conducted the royal liverpool philharmonic symphony and the british broadcasting corp orchestras mr frazier received his musical education at the detroit conservatory of music and at the university of michigan at ann arbor where he was a student of professor e h green at the young man was minister of music at peoples community church the same church where tenor george shirley and contralto georgia davis received early exposure the church encouraged his musical career and with the united negro college fund inc sponsored mr fraziers conducting debut with the detroit symphony orchestra upon mr fraziers return from england in he was selected to study at the prestigious national music camp at interlochen mich under william smith then associate conductor of the philadelphia symphony orchestra eugene ormandy the famed conductor of the philadelphia orchestra observed mr fraziers performance at interlochen and wrote the following it was with delight that i lismy opinion frazier has the makings of an excellent conductor he has my best wishes for success in his conducting career mr fraziers supporters include the detroit civic opera co inc as slave a black j a woman was woman jr f power instead of woman she was more important as a laborer than as a wife or mother this is still true today today when the average american woman has more freedom than ever before in history to choose her personal path to happiness and selffulfillmentwhether as wife mother artist teacher reformer or as anything and all things she may desirethe american black woman remains a slave to economic necessity the american woman struck a sharp blow for her own independence when she gained societys approval for working outside her home that was one battle the black woman didnt have to fight it was never thought unseemly for her to work in fact for a long time the proportion of black women who held jobs was twice that of white women who worked although since the s more and more white women have been partaking of the privilege of working still today a larger percentage of black women hold jobssome per cent in compared with per cent of white women it is not in history however that we will find the real disparity between white and black woman workers but in todays facts and figures white women today may work to fulfill themselves to fill their days or to earn extra spending money but as information gathered by the department of labor the bureau of the census and other us government agencies shows the black woman works because she has to how do we know lets look first at the jobs at which black women work only people who have to would work as household maids or cooks porters janitresses hospital attendants cooks helpers bus girls or as any of a number of other menial service personnel yet over onehalf of all black women workers held these jobs in not only do such service workers encounter some hard unpleasant labor they also earn salaries lower than those for any other jobs generally below a year add to hard work and low pay the absence from most of these positions of such fringe benefits as paid vacations job security or health insurance enjoyed by workers in other fields and you know for sure that few people would take these jobs out of choice in fact few white women do black women although they are only a tiny part of the entire labor force hold nearly twothirds of these lowstatus lowpaying jobs glance higher up the feminine career ladder and see how quickly the proportion of black women drops the percentage of black women in clerical and sales jobs is onethird that of white women in the professions whites outnumber blacks proportionally almost two to one and when teaching the career of many black professional women is excluded the blackwhite imbalance is greater still and the black woman is out of work and looking for it more often than the white womanin the unemployment rate for black women was twice that for white women now if she didnt have to have a job would she consider herself out of one when she wasnt working hardly if she cant as we have seen find a job that satisfies her soul does she at least have a job that fattens her purse it should come as no surprise that the black woman is the lowest paid person in the us labor force her average salary of a weekwas lower even than that for black men and of course way below the national average lest you wonder the black woman doesnt work to fill her days either she takes outside jobs when other important demands are placed on her time and energy for instance although the majority of white women do not work after marriage nearly half the black women workers are married and even more revealing of the black womans need to work is that although few white women work when they have young children over onethird of the black women do the black woman cannot afford to stay at home with her children the black woman obviously does not want to work in a poor job she must take what she can get with an education cut short most often by financial need for as you can see the black woman does not choose to work she must work because her family must have her income her family may look to her for support because she is the head of the household about onequarter of all black families were headed by a woman alone in but less than onetenth of all white families were half of these women work fulltime many others hold parttime jobs even if she is married she is more often than a white wife the sole earner in the family for the unemployment rate among black married men is twice that among white husbands or she may as do over half of all black wives work to help her husband keep their familys head above water that is she works not to bring in extra income but to bring in enough over onethird of the families in america with incomes below the poverty level are black with only one earner male or female the average black familys income is barely above that level one extra earnermost often a woman adds about to the black familys income and still does not bring it up to the income of an average white family with one earner the black woman works alone or with her husband because she must to keep her family out of poverty youre right of coursethere may well be other reasons for her working she may just want to get out of her house which is probably far from being the american homemakers dream come true in over onequarter of all black families were living in dilapidated or deteriorating housing the black homemaker hasnt money in her budget to fix up her home and she doesnt have the right color skin to move her family into a better neighborhood or too she may work to build a personal nest egg in case her marriage breaks apartand the chances that it will are many times greater than if she and her husband were white her life as a mother is also one that she might well want to escape motherhood can hardly be a joy with too many kids too little money a poor neighborhood bad schools and often no man in the house still underlying all these factors is the same financial need forcing black women to work of course we cannot ignore the fact that many black women have won tremendous success as workers in the professions the arts and in governmental or other careers these women may well work out of choice and for personal satisfaction but they are the exception not the rule among black workers nor can we exclude from these considerations the increasing number of black women who find themselves protected from want in the middle class with decent homes working husbands and the luxury of leisure many of these women still do work though to pay for their privileges the nonworkers among them cannot alter the generally bleak picture the statistics outline for most black women as more black families rise into the middle class more sink deeper into poverty the black leisure class is growing but still small and the nonworking black woman remains in a minority while a majority of her white sisters can afford leisure the average black woman as we have seen is forced to work because she is black in this country she is a slave to economic necessity and her vital economic role all but eclipses her roles as a woman now i am not saying that because she is a woman in america she should be forced to fit some socially prescribed mold of the typical happy american woman she may want to work she may want to combine many roles as do so many other american women she has a right to as full or as narrow a life as she chooses but she herself should be able to choose the path her life will follow only in choice is there freedom now the black woman has no choice now as for over years she is forced to work until she can pick a pattern for her life herself she will remain a slave drkenneth b clark is a scholar of the first magnitude when he comments on blackwhite relationships people listen his work on questions of the socialpsychological effects of discrimination have justly given him a nationwide reputation so that when he discusses such a vital question as black_power and its effects on interracial rapport one can expect his audience to weight seriously the positions he takes and the recommendations he advances it is precisely because of the respect with which he is held that the present remarks seek to reopen the question which dr clark recently attemptedor so it seemsto close in rather summary fashion i refer to his address given on october at the annual meeting of the association for the study of negro life and history held in greensboro north carolina and subsequently reprinted in the january issue of the journal of negro history my remarks are not designed to offend or belittle dr clarks ideas rather they are intended to pursue a question of vital importance to negroes and whites alike i must confess to being greatly disturbed by dr clarks address in greensboro and my subsequent reading of his paper has not lessened my uneasiness in the least i can heartily concur in his statement that the problems of the american negro are problems of america and that the negro remains the essential psychological reality with which america must continuously seek to come to terms moreover his suggestion that discrimination as practiced by insecure american whites is a psychological protection shaped and perpetuated by the dominant majority is also a most penetrating and cogent point and finally i agree that the walls of segregation are not only humiliatingbut given this type of chronic humiliation there develops selfdoubt subtle and flagrant forms of selfhatred personal and group frustrations internalized hostility aggressions selfdenial or bombast having found these important areas of agreement with dr clarks statements i must now take serious issue with his other points the overriding import of his paper is to advocate total and immediate integration as a means of resolving the nations racial problems as a scholar of and an activist in the twentiethcentury civil_rights movement i applaud this objective however deeply regret dr clarks assumptions that this goal can be achieved only by the complete rejection of the concepts and the efforts of black_power advocates in his remarks he makes no efforts to define black_power he gives no legitimacy to that phenomenon he affords it no chance to be heard nor does he try in the slightest to assess and analyze its several dimensions in fact he dismisses it out of hand as a negative and disruptive force the social scientist should make every effort to gather and evaluate his data in objective fashion on the question of black_power dr clark hasat least in the paper presently under discussiontotally failed to do just that he refers to black_power as ambiguous as possessing a nowin premise as being programmatically empty and pragmatically futile and yet he admits the tremendous psychological appeal which it has for the negro masses how can a social scientist cavalierly reject so important a phenomenon without making every effort to examine its substance dimensions and potential my remarks are intended as neither a defense nor a criticism of black_power they are designed simply to counter an intellectual position that would stifle objective discussion and repress analysis of a force in american life that fully merits open examination and serious consideration it seems to me that dr clark is wrong in assuming that black_power is merely a defensive mechanism grounded on hatred of white america and selfhatred among negroes and that its utility is of dubious value if nothing else the advocates of black_power certainly deserve an opportunity to be heard and to be taken seriously in positive terms dr clark admits that the situation for the masses of american negroes continues to deteriorate and yet he persists in believing that remedies of a traditionally approved natureinterracial cooperation to achieve redress through legislation the courts advanced employment opportunities and the likeare the only means to secure a full remedy does this not impose upon the negro whose position is already so difficult in this society the obligation of playing the game only by the white mans rules is it really so inconceivable that new and varied approaches might be tried simultaneously with the customary interracial efforts they need not be mutually exclusive what would prevent this nation if it really had the best interests of all in mind from advancing the cause of racial justice in a number of ways through varied techniques at one and the same time for over one hundred years black americans have played the game by the white mans rules and they have not yet won their full share of this nations promise this does not negate the possibility that they may yet do so nor does it deny the chance that they might do so more rapidly with a variety of strategies including black_power one is reminded for example of the very cogent article by william b hixson in the autumn issue of the american scholarin which he suggested that traditional commitments to law and order simply meant the formulation of a series of rules which protected and reinforced the position of the dominant elements in the society and thereby made more difficult any serious efforts for basic change and longrange reform one need not be against law and order to see that they can at the hands of a dominant majority have repressive manifestations and consequences for an aggrieved minority and if one relies only as apparently dr clark would prefer on a coalition of interested negroes and whites bent on achieving racial justice through interracial cooperation does not one run the risk of being in the very position of young claude brown and his father when they were represented by a white lawyer supposedly seeking damage charges on their behalf against a transit company following the incident in which young clark was struck by a bus in manchild in the promised land claude brown recalled his immediate suspicions well supported by subseqeunt events of the white lawyer in question and when he the white lawyer started talking to menot really talking to me just saying the stupid things that white people say to little colored boys with a smile on their faces and the little colored boys are supposed to smile toonothing in the world could have made me believe that cat was on our side we werent even people to him so how the hell was he going to fight our fight i wanted to ask dad why he went and got this guy but i knew why anybody could see that this cat wasnt so smart no he was just luckylucky that the world had dumb niggers like dad in it is there really any more reason to assume that even the bestintentioned white liberal is in longrange and fundamental terms better able than was this white lawyer to fight the black mans fight there are specific and necessary tasks in the struggle for racial justice that must be performed by negroes themselves on behalf of negroes and this does not in any way smack of racism or hatred for american whites if dr clark is to be believed and taken at his word on the basis of the essay in question he has given no credence to this fact indeed one sees little indication that he has considered it at all dr clark acts as though he does not understand and is not aware of the statements made by black_power advocates about what policies they would advance he talks merely as if they were bent on hatred and destruction this is not the case as clark could see from a reading of stokely carmichaels essay in the september issue of the new york review of books in that instance carmichael clearly emphasized that black_power was not a form of race hatred rather he stressed the need for white people to cooperate in giving black americans a chance to set their own goals and achieve their own objectives by developing a sufficiently solid economic and political base through which they could participate fully in matters affecting them and in the total pattern of american life this is hardly withdrawal it is rather a deliberate and conscious attempt to meet the problems of negro americans in very direct and positive fashion it merits a serious and open hearing and a chance to be tried it will require enormous effort patience and endurance for american negroes to implement black_power in meaningful terms they deserve an opportunity to do so it will take an extraordinary amount of understanding and patience for the dominant white majority to get out of the way and accord negroes this opportunity therein of course lies much of the problem the dominant white majority cannot readily sustain the psychic damage it would face if it truly recognized how corrosive its values and actions have been for black americans it will demand a profound commitment to racial justice for the american white to admit the grave injustices that his system and his leadership have visited upon the black minority once that awareness works its way to a conscious level however then the dominant majority might be willing as it ultimately must beto step back and allow black americans to define their own goals seek their fulfillment and in so doing redefine the landmarks and the guideposts that have customarily marked the path of interracial relations in this country this is what black_power seeks and whether or not its advocates are able to achieve it they fully deserve the occasion to make the effort unfortunately dr clark seems unwilling to accord them that fundamental chance dr clark argues that negroes and whites must cooperate to eradicate the intolerable aspects of ghetto life segregated schools inadequate housing job discrimination the sale and distribution of inferior merchandise the filth and drabness of ghetto streets and the repressive conduct of the police in ghetto neighborhoods black_power advocates share this goal too clark urges experimentation and the use of human intelligence and training in the development of constructive solutions to these problems here again black_power advocates concur what they are saying however is that these goals and objectives should be sought in a number of ways one of which includes policy formulation and implementation by negroes themselves is it really so unthinkable that this should be tried is it really so inconceivable that it might work and that by working it might make a genuine contribution to the overall solution to the racial problem in america by rejecting the possibilities of black_power dr clark really does himself as a social scientist the negro americans as a depressed minority and the nation at large as a troubled society a grave disservice he adopts the same type of negativism and repression that he has so long fought dr clark seems to close his mind to the potentials of black_power on the grounds that it represents a racist solution this is in no sense the case in their recent book black_power the politics of liberation in america stokely carmichael and charles v hamilton have given the lie to this assumption there is no reason to equate black_power with the racism of white supremacists the former seeks positive solutions leading to a strengthened and stable negro community that can take full advantage with whites of the promise of american life the latter is and has been motivated by hatred and the concept of perpetual racial separatism there is no parallel whatever between black_power and white supremacy in their motivations conduct and goals as carmichael and hamilton have explained the goal of the racists is to keep black people on the bottom arbitrarily and dictatorially as they have done in this country for over three hundred years the goal of black selfdetermination and black selfidentityblack_poweris full participation in the decisionmaking processes affecting the lives of black people and the recognition of the virtues in themselves as black people the black people of this country have not lynched whites bombed their churches murdered their children and manipulated laws and institutions to maintain oppression dr clark has failed to make this necessary distinction and yet it is a difference which is absolutely crucial for both the social scientist and the american layman to understand and accept if we are to fashion new instruments functionally positive instruments that will help us allblack and whiteto resolve the terrible dilemma of racial oppression in this country black_power may not be the answer certainly it is not the only approach which this society can and must take but the advocates of black_power deserve a hearing and the chance to make an honest effort their potential contributions merit the recognition and support of the nation at large such openness by the dominant majority is after all the true test of a free and democratic society it seems incredible that a nation grounded on the values of risktaking and innovation should seem so reluctant to accord the american negro this vital opportunity to make a series of efforts on his own behalf initially to the possible benefit of us all in longrange terms if black_power were given its day there is no reason why fullscale and active interracial cooperation could not proceed simultaneously there is no reason why a variety of strategies could not be implemented to meet a complex range of racial problems americas racial difficulties are sufficiently numerous and perplexing and the size and resources of the nation sufficiently ample that we can and should sustain for example a stokely carmichael a floyd mckissick a ralph abernathy a roy wilkins and a whitney young at one and the same time pluralism in action means just that in an open society to deny such a possibility as dr clark seems to do is to give away the ball game before we have even taken to the field that would be totally inexcusable my stance is racial and no apologies for that the world is in such a bad state today because of white racism because of the white worlds denial of the supremacy of the spirit because of the white worlds denial of love i do not write english the language of a people serves them to satisfy their needs and aspirations the english give love as a privilege or a means towards some material profitand i have historical evidence mine is an international black language summoning the power of millions of indignant black people for the final destruction symbolic or real of any agency that denies the world love this is the rumbling of the inevitable fury of millions of black people sick and tired of the role european refugees made them play for centuries this is the moving spirit of black masses when they hear the strained laughter of a distant drum stomping the ear of the world asserting themselves and the supremacy of the spirit but after i have written a poema release of forceit stands still like the defiant baobab tree i move on because it is

physical confrontationis going to be a second from now so will my son i hope that pernicious and wayward white lady lula in dutchman says she wants clay to have his manhood says she wants him to be a bad nigger what she doesnt know is that clay is already a bad nigger already has his manhood a manhood more potent than anything this silly white girl ever imagined when clay reveals himself to be a true man a black man who has no use for her kind she has only one alternative to deny that he exists or ever existed for not to do so would cause some seismic trembling in one of the universal laws you know the one that says niggers sambos uncle ts colored boys and wouldbe black men whose manhood is bestowed upon them by the merciful great white woman can exist but true black men cannot and so lula not prepared to alter the natural order in an effort to refuse him meaningful space stabs clay in the back this is what happened to marse william styron when he looked up and discovered nat turners manhood turner was so beautiful so black so together with his person and his people that marse styron set outdeliberately mind you to kill him to hide him away to pretend that he never existed this is the sick italian iago bringing the beautiful black othello down this is the white crackerpoliceman in an alley shooting some fleeing nigger boy in the back this is the dream of western civilization the black man never existed that marse willie styron distorted the character of the historic nat turner is an accepted fact see for example william styrons nat turner ten black writers respond published by beacon press but styron attempted to kill to obliterate a complete historical and political tradition of black people that tradition being this black people was and is a rebellious people ostensibly it seems that styron is favoring this tradition by making a black rebellion the subject of his major preoccupation a close examination however shows that his whole intent is rather to destroy that tradition completely unlike most white people who go around smugly halfbelieving that blacks as slaves never revolted styron leaps into the mouth of a black revolt takes out his can of white paint and goes to work when he is finished the thing is perfectly camouflaged against the equally white landscape which is americas sick white mind nat turners revolt taken in its simplest form was a political act an act that should be and it certainly is inspiration for his people today and this is what styron was afraid of so he avoided the political implications of the revolt by reducing the affair to a level of psychological stereotypes which has the added advantage of making this strange tale plausible to whites it is this psychological stress in the novel that makes styrons nat sound like some sensitive faggish art major whenever he opens his mouth this is why every time styron alias thomas gray pops a political question like why did he nat kill joseph travis who was a good slavemaster the answer to such a question is obviously because he is a white m f and there is no such thing as a good slavemaster this is a political response but styrons nat is not capable of that his response is psychological due to his extreme sensitivity for a moment i was so surprised that i couldnt speak i sat down slowly then the surprise became perplexity and i was silent for a long time saying finally even then thatthat l cant give no reply to mr gray page confessions before the novel is over styron comes right out and calls nat and his revolt a flatassed failure p and do you think nat gives him a political response back telling this cracker that there is no such thing as an unsuccessful black revolt because every time a black fist raises over a white head we are just that much closer to overcoming the vipers every white throat cut is a success in itself but styrons nat doesnt have a brain doesnt have an ideology his head has been addled with sensitivity and so his response is i felt myself shivering as i gazed downward between my legs at the plank floor and at the links of cold cast iron sagging like a huge rusting timber chain in the chill dim light suddenly i felt the approach of my own death my hands trembled my bones ached i heard grays voice pp this cats nothing but a bundle of nerves styron used this extreme sensitivity bit as a smoke screen behind which to hide the political implications of turners revolt consider the following statement a black leader and some black followers killed of their white oppressors from the point of view of black people this is a beautiful artistic statement and it is artistic because it unifies all sociological economical political etc implications of these black people it implies that these people are fighting a common enemy it implies brotherhood love and trust among these people it is a positive heroic inspiring optimistic statement it says a lot that only black people can understand its black poetry it is otherwise when a white man reads this statement first it is not a reality to white people that they can be killed by blacks in the free world the price of white life is very expensive and that of black life dirt cheap it is a tacit understanding between the gangs around the woodlawn area in chicago and the police that the gangs can take the lives of little nigger children but if they kill a white student for example from the university of chicago somebody has to payand it doesnt matter who as long as he is black nat turner stands in black history as one who didnt look at the price tag when he revolted he didnt give a damn who was a good or important cracker he went out to slaughter the white oppressor period and so he did styrons book is not a meditation on history its a meditation on the political implications of this simple statement some black men killed their white oppressors styron seeks to soften the hard impact of such political implication by expanding that simple statement into pages he set out to change the speed of a rifle bullet headed for some honkies brain into the soft drop of a tear shed for the miserable state of those colored people set out to change the flying crash of a flaming molotov into the familiar thump of the sunday newspaper thrown by the local colored boy the success of this attempt can be attested to by the fact that when one finishes the book he finds it difficult to believe even if he is black that real black men cut real throats for their freedom one finds that styron has worked some wicked magic the fact is changed into a phantasy the action into a reaction the black into white and you into a fool a fool because no black person needs to know what went on in nats mind he has only to consult his own status in life to know that white liberals like styron always want to know the black man but when they say they want to know what happened in nats mind they are assuming that the statement some black people killed their white oppressors is meaningless a black leader like nat doesnt begin to mean anything until they are told that he has a white mind and that all the influences in his life were white it is only then that he becomes a significant leader and so they gradually begin to know him the assumption behind this is of course only white really exists if l dont imagine myself a black man styron said to himself as he painted his face with black paint how am i ever going to know that black people exist one certainly cant take their word for it in short styrons confessions of nat turner is a deliberate attempt not to see the political reality of black people it is an attempt not to see the thousands of nat turners in the ghettos of hundreds of american cities it is an act of negative hallucination thats what the psychiatrists call itin an effort to pretend that black people are not a rebellious people the book seeks to deny the obvious political connection between nats revolt and the revolt of black people today indeed the two revolts are different only in the sense that lovers are different styron belongs to a tradition of southern writers that gives the impression of actually dealing with the problem of black and white relations when what in fact it does is attack any new reality that threatens its nostalgic southern order in its avoidance of real issues this tradition connects withand gains support fromthe artforarts sake school and this is how you get those stupid university of chicago types who want to see the novel just as a work within itself this is fidgeting art and propaganda styron represents the white mans last futile attempt to overhaul his shottohell and fagged moral psychic this man is desperate now he will do anything to absolve himself of his guilty past whenever there is a riot white liberals choke on their fright and guilt this is as it should be so it is understandable why they are willing to believe those huge lies styron tells in his book white people are beginning to realize that the oppressor is immoral and that the liberator is moral and free and hence beautiful this is after all a very recent idea for during the th century and the early th it was widely accepted that the oppressor the survival of the fittest was the moral being now its the other way around the survival of the fittest and white people know they are the oppressor and are immoral and sick creatures styrons book attempted to change this as incredible as it may sound by making the black people the oppressor and the white crackers those gentle benevolent landowners whose sole purpose in life was to liberate darkies the liberator this is why one black critic complains that in styrons propaganda piece nat turners rebellion is depicted as a worse crime than slavery ten black writers respond p styron didnt get that pulitzer prize for nothing styrons novel is an example of a sick literature and i mean the term sick in the most technical sense freud and normal o brown talk about mentally disturbed people as being at odds with their past either they deny it or accept it to be something it is not marse styron still thinks this is year dumb cracker and furthermore there is a great tendency to escape something imminent in the present styron says his book was not meant to comment on the black revolt of today while at the same time white reviews are using it as an argument against h rap brown and stokely carmichael in its attempt to escape the present to separate politics from art the past from the present history from existence in its attempt to fragmentize rather than unify styrons novel is sick literatureie propaganda art unifies it connects the past with the present sociology with psychology politics with art this is what leroi jones means when he says aesthetics and ethics are one but cracker willie styron cant say this because he doesnt want to see the relationship between the past and the present to do so would be admitting openly that marse w styron is an immoral racist oppressor etc and thats too close to home sick literature and propaganda fragmentize true art unifies black writing leroi jones represents a new school of writing and critical thought that is the exact opposite of that of william styron the principle that aesthetics and ethics are one is the foundation for this new school black writers and critics are the only people who can possibly launch this new literature the only people for whom it has meaning as they are the only people who will benefit from emphasizing the oneness harmony and integrity between the present and the past between what is said and what is done between history and fact between literature and for example eating habits the oppressor is always an immoral being people liberating themselves are the only moral people when facts history and sociological statistics oppress they become not fact but fiction not history but fantasy not statistic but alchemy a people liberating itself justifies all only a healthy and moral people can breathe life into letters literature is alive only when it can move freely between the past and present without the anxiety of stumbling on certain facts like america murders million people a literature is alive and free and beautiful and hence useful only when it is not guiltridden white literature is guiltridden and at odds with its past witness styron and needs to be psychoanalyzed hence alas norman mailer black writers need not attempt to salvage a sick white literary tradition that refuses to see black existence that refuses to give meaningful space to black bodies no we black writers have a responsibility to our people the styrontype you can hurry up and believe has his responsibility to his our responsibility is to expose the moral vacuousness of the white viper nat called him the serpent reveal to our people his immoral system and to prepare our people for the day when his sickness finally engulfs him the middle of the night mr stewart duff lay sleepless and in the most melancholy mood he reached for the lamp beside his bed he missed it and reached for it again this time he knocked it to the floor he grunted jumped from his bed and angrily flipped the light on now that he could see it and put it securely in the middle of the table he gave a gloriously resonant belch and sat down on the side of the bed his grandnephew slept in the next room in the deep quiet mr duff could hear the boy snoring unperturbed by the noise of the falling lamp mr duff wished he could sleep so soundly but he was feeling poorly again and how could he sleep when he could not lie down to rest he didnt know exactly what was wrong but he did know that he was ill he felt a cloud of dizziness and he again belched loudly during the afternoon mr duff had dined with his old friend mr alton the two of them had not seen each other for many many years mr alton had left the town when they were both hardly more than boys and the years had danced away leaving them old and heavy of feet and heart mr alton had lost his wife to the same death that stole his only son in war he moved back to his hometown and took a room at a boarding house a yellow building which seemed forever in a state of awkward peeling like an old piece of documentation parchment the encounter between the longparted friends was teary mr duff cried very easily mr alton wheezed a great deal and kept smiling he left most of his food untouched mr duff ate heartily sometimes through crystaline tear drops which were almost silverlike in the brash gleam of the lights mr duff was happy to receive a dinner invitation seldom had he gone anywhere lately for his contemporaries in the town were either moved away or living on the fringes of the lives of their children or grandchildren mr duff had a highly developed sense of self it was always there beneath the marks of time behind the wrinkles which cut gashlike into his face behind the eyes discolored by years of useage and it was present also in the manner of walking when he was strolling alone he could become brisker and more supple than younger men he knew still he liked to know that he was thought about emershed thus within himself mr duff had not contended with the possibility that people might be weary of listening to a man who had outlived all of his friends and most of his relatives many of whom had been possessed of such great charity that they had stood beneath the girdings of the community like pillars as bulwarks in spirit and in gesture and that he now was decrying his fate into the sympathies and the cool ears of the most recent generations he could hardly know that younger people measured the possibility of their duration on this earth by his old age and wondered if they could attain it and by what fatedefying methods nor could he know that people little younger than himself felt humanly insidious and with the most vulgar and the grossest of superstition that mr duff was living on their time he was for them a stopwatch something to measure an unerring time by and therefore he was a symbol of life and a heralder of death mr alton had asked about his wife but he changed the subject when he realized that mr duff didnt wish to discuss it besides he had not known her but the landlady informed him later that the woman had left mr duff and moved in with her children in new orleans she had an unaccountable disease it was said mrs edwards added under her breath and in a sniffling voice im sure it was her heart anybodyd have a bad heart living with that selfish monster acts like he got some option on life aint nobody else got never been well a day in his life aint never been known to ask nobody else how theyre feeling though naw sir dont nobody visits him cause folks tired o being treated like they doctors and he got people here too in town but they dont go see him either last christmas i did go there to take him a basket when i heard he was real ill when i got there he was carving little animals out of wood but he wouldnt let himself be well for once before i left he had given me a complete goover of his sickness the next day he come by this way big as life i closed the shades real tight today was the first i seen of him since i got to live too you know everybody got to live for themselves mr alton was remembering mr duff as a boy but there were too many blurring images and too great an overlapping of memories his heart could not define and carry the impact of it he concentrated on the present and found himself thanking mrs edwards for a very good dinner then he excused himself and went down the hallway to his little room he took out his pocket watch to see what time it was it had grown dark and he contented himself to sit by the window and rest dusk had fallen when mr alton awoke from the restful sleep which had overcome him he startled himself upright but it had grown chilly in the huge drafty room and his limbs ached his left leg had fallen asleep and when he stomped it lightly on the floor to start the blood circulating again a million icy pinpoints sprang into it and he fell into the chair to cry out from the discomforture he sat still and waited finally he could stand without the unpleasant edginess he prepared himself for bed and when his tired head touched the oldfashioned high pillows he was already snoring and dead to every sound of the house the town and the world at six oclock paul mr duffs grandnephew woke up for the last time that morning he had tossed for most of the long night and he was gruff in spirit angry with his uncle for having kept him awake with his insomnia several times he wished to call his uncle and find out what was bothering him but he decided against it his uncle would surely seize the opportunity to begin his customary enumeration of all his real and imagined illnesses and sleep would be impossible after listening to him the house was quiet now paul bathed and dressed he ate a jam sandwich and drank some milk he was in a hurry recently he had gotten a job at a supermarketthe largest in the townas a stock boy he was the first and only black boy there and he wanted to do the most commendable work possible someday another boy who needed the job as much as he had needed it might find it to his liking it was a long enough thought for a yearold boy he had wished to say im gone to his uncle but he was afraid to after last night he knew that it would be more difficult than ever to get away from him he did like living with his uncle and he did love him but it was becoming hard not to hurt his feelings and he wished he could understand him he thought about the story of the boy and the sheep and how the boy had cried wolf so many times it seemed to him that his uncle was similar to that boy but it made him chuckle to compare his graybeard of an uncle to a little boy and he raced down the road he hoped his uncle would not appear suddenly at the door at the section of town where the streets were paved and bordered with trees and grass paul slowed down and began to walk at an even cool pacemr alton an early riser had begun to drink the last of several cups of coffee brewed so well by mrs edwards he considered telling her how fine it tasted but he remembered her cruel discussion of his old friend duff and he merely nodded when she passed his table on her way back to the kitchen she hadnt known duff when he was a young man when he was as straight and tall as an oak and when it would have embarrassed him to mention to any other person so much as a mild headache they were both good hunters in those days and fishermen too he remembered that duffs father had owned the finest buggy in the whole county and that he was also the first black man to own an automobile in those days there was no woman who would have closed her shades against the approach of duff unless she was touched in the head he thought he would drop by to see his friend they could reminisce from the strength and glow of those days so very long ago his friend would recall a quiet happiness to take away the bitter encroachment of a helpless old age nearing mr duffs house mr alton could see that the old man had not begun to bestir himself into the new day he rapped at the door and turned to see a woman feeding a stray cat some scraps of meat he knocked again there was no answer he walked around the house listening quietly to hear any waking sound which would mean that his old friend was home he knocked again at the back door and he started to leave a note but there was a light in the room and so he went to the window and tapped it with his walking cane he thought about mrs edwards recounting her visit to duff and her description of his imagin ary illness he wondered if he might indeed be ill but he realized that a grandnephew who lived with duff would be the first to attend to his uncle the old man peered into the window for good measure he could see someone lying in a slumped position but he didnt know if it were duff or the nephew he didnt wish to behave in a silly alarmist fashion he called loudly and he did become alarmed he called to the woman feeding the kitten together they opened the door and propped the old man onto the pillows he was not speaking and his pulse was worse than faint he was a very sick man sister do you own a phone that you might call a doctor without answering the woman streaked from the house moments later mr alton watched his old friend leave for the hospital in an ambulance and curious neighbors come to see the old man down the street found dying in his room all by himself when mr duff awoke in the hospital room much later his nephew paul his brother ernest his niece mattie and mr alton came in to see him he couldnt recall the last time he had seen them all together the visitors explained to him that he had suffered indigestion and a stroke yes he said i was sick all night long i was sick as i could be it sure means something to have somebody care about you dont it now but the visitors were silent and paul stared at his old uncle for a long long time before he left the room his mother followed after him soon the group of relatives were standing on the sidewalk in front of the small town community hospital mr duff in his room alone turned his face toward the cool aqua walls beyond the partition in the middle of the room he thought someone coughed without seeing anyone though he whispered i was sick i was sick all night long sick as i could be tomorrow i will lose the door on this dream chapter of my life forever i know full well that in doing i will forfeit much true happiness and just possibly my chances for ever again achieving such satisfaction but so it always has been and so it must be life is like this to force a man to choose between that which provides him an admirable public posture and that which gives him personal joy and fulfillment as squire of mount vernon and hero of fort le boeuf already i have achieved more than most accomplished men of my age and station tomorrow taking as my wife martha dandridge custis i shall improve my station fourfold the widow will bring to me some additional acres of valuable virginia land plus a good slaves and an elegant town house in williamsburg further she will open to me because of her social connections what remaining avenues there exist to the seat of power in williamsburg at the age of on my next birthday a month and some days away i shall be a man of considerable wealth and consequence all this is not to be taken lightly and yet it will not be so easy as all that the fanciful pleasures of my career as bachelor squire of mount vernon have been great it will be difficult to abandon them forever i know that i shall spend agonizing nights longing for flora that so aptly named vixen of my terrible desire i shall suffer remembering her soft strong body her taunting laugh even her musk soft yet strong like her body but above allthe maddening dance which she used to fire me to torment me to have her way with me to degrade me for yes she degraded me time and again she degraded me if it had been possible to hate her i would have destroyed her long ago i would have told louis to use the lash on her i would have put her in the fields broken her spirit with the hardest of work fed her to thor the black stud instead i permitted her to degrade me she would come to my bed taunting me saying master and saying that with just the most bearable kind of sarcasm saying master if you are good to akar then i will make you happy i will give you pleasure you can know no other place and i bargained with her i the master of mount vernon the master of her very life bargained with her i had only to command her she was mine to do as i bade but i bargained with her in order to enjoy her smiles her caprice i gave in to her i let her degrade me and yet it was through the dreams of flora that i finally saw deep into my own nature her female cruelty led me to selfdiscovery because of her guile i know now that marrying mrs custis is the best thing for me that will save me the marriage will force upon me the style and pattern of life which will make it forever impossible for me to sink so low as flora brought me it is strange now to sit here by the fire as the night grows old with the servants long since asleep and the january cold seeping through the sills and to recall the fantasies which have brought me to this moment the winters at wakefield were always terribly cold it seems although i remember so little specifically about them mostly i recall hannibal the slave the huge handyman who was my fathers favorite it seems to me now that it was during the winters that i saw most of him lawrence my halfbrother was always away for he was too old to be of much companionship and so it was hannibal who was assigned to look after me he would put me to bed and then sit watching the fire in the fireplace until i fell asleep sometimes if i awoke in the night he would still be there sitting beside the dying fire i did not realize until much much later that he remained there because sarah his slave woman had been sold he stayed because it was warm in my room the drafty cabin which he shared with a group of male slaves was miserable but i did not realize that he sat in the chair and slept one night i awoke to find him standing beside my bed using my slopjar i watched in fascination i had never seen anything so large but more than that i was shocked at hannibal using the slopjar slaves never used anything that belonged to their masters hannibal had broken that law because he knew that he could not return to my room once he had left the house to go to the outhouse in the slave quarters i no longer remember what stroke of malice prompted me to tell my father what hannibal had done but i do recall that my father was so angry that he personally took the strap to hannibal i watched in shame and guilt as my father led the giant black man to the stables and there in a space used by the boys who tended the horses as a clearing among the bales of hay made him strip off his shirt and breeches hannibal stood there his great body bare except for a white rag around his private parts his muscles seeming to ripple in the sunlight flowing in the stable door i recall experiencing a quiver of fear my father was not a large man and not especially a strong one but there he stood ordering hannibal to kneel before him i knew that had he possessed the courageor madnessto do so that hannibal could simply have taken my fathers neck in his hands and broken it but there was something else which i felt something more subtle and sinister a feeling whichthanks to godi would not understand for many years to come hannibal knelt and my father proceeded to lash him with all his strength throughout the ordeal the black man never once cried out never even murmured even though great whelps rose across his broad back and shoulders and blood streamed down his body it was winter a short time following that incident when my father died i was then living at my fathers farm near fredericksburg it was a bleak and terrible time and i was relieved when spring came and i could help supervise the planting and the operation of river farm i did not care much for school but i was very fond of moving through the fields watching the slaves at work and helping mr thornton our overseer to manage the farm i did not like it at all when in i had to go to live with my brother lawrence at hunting creek i was then and i already was beginning to have wilder fantasies i was very curious about the sex lives of the slaves and on occasions i would wander down to their quarters late at night and pass quietly among the cabins some of the sounds emanating from the cabins filled me with ambiguous feelings i was both excited and repelled it was particularly outside the cabin of thor the stud slave that i lingered he was quite popular with the women even when it was not a matter of business for the plantation and there always was some woman in his cabin i was intrigued by thor perhaps because in physical aspect he so reminded me of hannibal but he had few other of the attributes of my fathers slave where hannibal was kind and patient thor was cold and arrogant where hannibal was docile and yielding thor was bold and defiant hannibal knew he was a servant thor knew he was a valuable commodity a producer of healthy slave children for the plantation the slave lawrence had given me as my personal servant was a son of thor a boy some five years younger than myself for some reason thor was especially fond of this particular boy who he had named akar after he said his own family back in west africa thor took the boy in hand and taught him athletic tricks taught him hunting and scouting in the woods along the potomac because he was mine he had to do only the minimum of work in the tobacco fields when not in my service he spent most of his time around the stables he learned to ride quite well and i used to take him with me on jaunts across the country and along the potomac by the time he was he already was as solid and as sturdy as a man of it was clear that he had inherited the physique and the potency of his father it was in fact during akars fifteenth year that lawrence died once again death had come to challenge me and to alter my fate i was now and mount vernon which lawrence had built for his wife anne was mine the responsibility of the huge estate was in my hands and i knew that i had to demonstrate that i could handle it mr thornton was brought over from river farm to act as overseer and i plunged into the task of making mount vernon one of the most prosperous farms in all of virginia but all of this dedication to work did not preclude me from serving in the militia i had been named adjutant and there was plenty of work to do whenever possible i took akar with me for he now served as my valet when robert dinwiddie lt col of virginia selected me to take a contingent of men to ride to presque isle to warn the mischiefmaking french against further advances on crown territory in the ohio valley i arranged to take akar with me we rode off into the woodlands heading north and west of the virginia territory facing not only the treacherous french but also the wild and dangerous indians winter came early that year it was cold and it snowed heavily before we reached fort le boeuf at one point we became lost in the forest two of our pack mules slid off a ravine and we ended up with virtually no provisions to add to our problems we found ourselves completely surrounded by a band of hostile redskins that was when i thanked god that i had brought akar along the indians descended upon us as we stopped for the evening to set up camp beside a rushing stream before we could reach our muskets they were all among us my men were panicstricken and it was not from the cold alone that they trembled but akar stepped forward and addressed the indian leader he held out his hands and smiled in some sort of greeting and the indian leader responded with a similar gesture they touched hands then shoulders then touched hands again the indian smiled then turned and said something to his own braves many of them pushed forward to touch akars hands and shoulders in the same manner that their leader had done it was clear now that they were not going to harm us they did not pay much notice of the white men there but they did not menace us they came forward and settled around in groups at one point akar said to me that he was going to ask the indians for food but you do not know their language i cautioned him akar only laughed all men of goodwill speak a common language he said they will understand he returned to the indian leader and with gestures indicated that we had lost our mules and our provisions the indian nodded as if he understood then spoke to one of his lieutenants at once a group of the redmen disappeared from the nowglowing fireside in less than an hour a new party of redskins arrived on the scene but what a strange safari there was at least two dozen of them including a bunch of slim young girls holding blankets up to their faces so that only their dark eyes surveyed us they had brought two horses apparently to replace our lost mules and a basket of maize and dried fish but the prize parcel was a freshly killed doe which they proudly dumped at akars feet while the militiamen set about skinning the animal and preparing it for cooking over the open fire a curious event took place a dozen or more yards away from the fire the braves began erecting a wigwam i had assumed that akar somehow had communicated to the indian leader that i was both his master and the leader of the militiamen but that appeared at once not to be the case the indians did not at any time pay the slightest attention to me or to the other white men akar was the center of all their attention when the food was ready they urged akar to eat well which he did having a fullsome and healthy appetite finally the indian leader bade akar follow him over to the little tent which had been set up akar stood in the doorway and laughed with delight then he entered the tent alone almost at once i heard girlish giggles emanate from the tent and then i realized that none of the young girls was standing about they were all inside the tent with akar the militiamen were both astounded and annoyed why do they favor that black boy of yours one of them demanded with great surliness what do they see so wonderful in him the others chorused their agreement if i may say so major one of them dared to begin that young buck of a black needs to know his place i got up from my place and wandered in the direction of the tent i was in the throes of an unobtainable excitement the sounds coming from inside the tent thrilled and tormented me i could distinguish akars sighs his heavy breathing and now and then an indian maiden cried out in commingled pain and joy i paced around the tent oblivious of the indians and of my own men i wanted to thrust aside the tent and to look upon the scene a wildness possessed me on an impulse i moved toward the tents entrance but the indian leader stepped forward and barred my way the face that had smiled at akar now glared at me but i am his master i shouted i am commander here and that boy is my slave for an interminable moment the indian stared into my face he said nothing at all at length he merely shook his head that was enough one glance around us showed me that the braves were alert for action there was nothing to do but to return to the fireside and wait when finally i drifted off to sleep in my blankets the revelry in the tent was going full score several other of the militiamen already were asleep but all the indians remained awake silent watchful solemn at dawn when we all awakened there were no indians there was no wigwam and there was no akar we searched and shouted for the slave but there was no sign of him either he had run away with the indians or else they had forced him to accompany them for me it was easier to believe the latter i could not image that akar would ever voluntarily run away from me i had always been a kindly master to him as we rode off toward presque isle it was clear that the militiamen resented me for my leniency with akar it was an affront to them that the slave had run off they had secretly looked forward to abusing him for what had happened during the night i knew that they wanted to teach him a lesson and he had foiled them but the great loss was mine i had become dependent in many ways upon akar and i already missed him i kept telling myself that he would follow behind us after he had satiated himself with pleasure with the squaws i was not prepared to accept anything else the hazards of the journey deflected my thoughts from my prodigal slave and when we encountered the french we found them impertinent and defiant nevertheless we delivered his majestys warnings to them against their incursions into crown territory and then we set out for the return journey to williamsburg when we reached the country where akar had vanished we found no trace of any human beings although i forced the militiamen to scour the area and we made camp at precisely the same place where we had met the friendly braves after two days there with the militiamen constantly grumbling we embarked on the final leg of our journey when we arrived back at williamsburg we had been gone for more than weeks back at mount vernon i prepared my report of the journey which was published as the journal of major george washington in the report i made it quite clear that the french were recalcitrant and that further difficulties could be expected from them in the ohio valley the report was very favorably received by lt gov dinwiddie who immediately decided that i would have to lead a force of volunteers into the territory to challenge the french the following april was set at the time of my leaving virginia but in the meantime another slave emerged to trouble my life i had contracted a rather bad cold during the journey west and so it was necessary upon my return that i have rest and medication dr james rode in to see me several times and i was put in the care of annes maid lucybelle it so happens that a few days later lucybelle fell on the stairs and wrenched her ankle as a result her young daughter was sent up from the quarters to fetch and carry for me i suppose i had seen the child beforecertainly i had for lucybelle had brought her to the big house on many occasionsbut not in recent years and so her appearance came as a decided shock she was in the very bloom of her years her young breasts were full her body firm and astonishingly mature her small head regal her face at once innocent and alluring was i feverish could i george washington squire of mount vernon master of many slaves promising officer of the kings servicecould i be excited by a mere black servant girl my slave or was i afflicted with the incurable disease of fantasy it was too ridiculous to consider seriously i merely regarded the girl accepted her ministrations gave her instructions and tried to relax and read there was much to do before the april excursion many reports to scan much planning to do learning of a few key french words in order to communicate with the foreign forces around presque isle still the girl was there alive looking down at me serving the broth changing the linen her reality was undeniableas undeniable as her extraordinary beauty now it is common of course for slaveowners to take their pleasure among their slaves and i am rare for not having done so the officers at fredericksburg made great sport of me thinking that i spend hours cavorting in the hay with the comely slaves after all i am a bachelor i am without responsibilities to a wife or to a fiancee why then do i not have little halfwhite pickaninnies trailing about the quarters those mulattoes who are on the premises are the issue of the overseers and it is whispered of lawrence but i have abstained but now everytime she is near me my body fires i feel a restlessness which is different in aspect from that excitement which comes to me when i go to the quarters and listen outside the cabins or when i see the great muscular body of thor arched over one of the yielding women what is this difference one morning as she turned to go i called to her flora i said come here come to me she came shyly standing silent her brown hands folded before her where is lucybelle i asked how is she doing lucybelle mending well sir she cannot yet come up the stairs is there anyone else in the house now no sir they are all working in the fields and at the stables the cook is in the smokehouse i regarded her well experiencing an unfamiliar delight in her quiet submissiveness i was emboldened where have you been that i have not seen you girl working in the fields sir and at night what do you do at night she did not hesitate or blush which was good we sing and pray sir then it is time to sleep we must rise before dawn sir and your man who is your man have you been bedded by thor she stepped back affronted sir i have no man i am but now lucybelle keeps thor away so thor has been after you sir thor is after every woman it is his work sir i laughed at that indeed it was so it was thors work work which he dearly loved you are a virgin then i said with some disbelief it was difficult to imagine such a prize being untouched the girl was not embarrassed lucybelle keeps me so sir yes lucybelle would i thought lucybelle ruled the big house and it was not surprising that she tried to rule the quarters as well she was as straitlaced and puritannical as any williamsburg matron suddenly on impulse i said take off your clothes girl i want to have a close look at your body without protest she obeyed stripping bare standing before me like some yoruba queen i felt both fear and excitement i wanted to reach out but my arms would not rise i wanted to seize her and to thrust her beneath me in the bed but my manhood failed me her presence overwhelmed me rendered me impotent was it real was i dreaming what shall i do now sir she asked i could not speak for a moment only stare and then i turned away in shame put your clothes on i said then return to your duties when she had dressed and was about to leave i said you must not mention this to anyone especially not to lucybelle if you do you will be thrashed yes sir she answered then softly left the room after she had gone the soft sweet musk of her remained exciting me anew i turned restlessly in bed experiencing now all the hard forcefulness which had failed me when she stood before me i got out of bed and went to the washstand to douse my face and head with cold water i was in terrible misery even after lucybelle was well again i kept flora on in the house but there was not much chance to see her i spent most of my time now preparing for the second journey west and in april i took a force of volunteers back over my former trail i was lt col washington now an authority on the growing threat of french intervention into the colonies as fate would have it things went badly on the second journey and i was glad when after many weeks we straggled back to williamsburg the experience had proven humiliating compared to the first journey and i tried to forget it by concentrating on the farm there was much planning and surveying to do and this kept me busy there was not even much time to spend thinking about flora although she was always about the house watching me with her shy dark eyes she had never understood the little scene in my bedroom that morning then about a year later some militiamen arrived on the premises with a most surprising commodity they had gone out to round up a group of marauding indians and had found akar among them the slave had been captured and over the protest of the chief had been brought back to fredericksburg i was in my study when they arrived so i went down to the yard to greet them akar standing with his hands tied behind him was the perfect picture of the noble savage he wore only the leather breechcloth which the indians affected in the summer and his great apollonian body as ideally constructed as a statue glistened in the sunlight he hung his head he did not even look up when i approached when the militiamen had gone i decided to personally take akar back to the stables and punish him in any case mr thornton was out in the fields and could not do the job i took down the strap and stood facing akar he looked directly at me for the first time it was a strange new looka look of mixed mirth and defiance why did you run away i asked him to be free he replied but i was good to you i gave you everything a slave could want you did not give me freedom dont be impertinent you are a slave i own you that is why i ran away i slashed him with the strap he did not quiver i slashed him again harder he only looked at me with that strange new look get down on your knees i commanded akar sank to his knees but his eyes never left my face i did not like facing him so i stepped behind him and delivered two dozen fierce lashes upon his back when that was done i bade him stand then i untied his hands you will work in the fields now i said i will tell mr thornton to give you the hardest work in the fields and i will order him to shoot you down like a dog if you try to run away he only looked at me go now i said go to the quarters and wash your sweaty body he turned and stalked from the stable as regal as an oba i returned to my study but i could not concentrate on the business at hand i was filled with the excitement i had not known now for many months i tore off my clothes and went to my bedroom to lie down as i turned from my window i saw flora crossing the yard from the quarter it was then that like a flash i conceived the idea which set me off on the path to selfdiscovery i threw a silk robe around me and went out into the hallway at the top of the stairs i called out to lucybelle send flora up here at once making my voice as stern as possible then i returned to my bedroom closed the door behind me and waited at her light tapping on my door i bellowed out for her to enter which she did apprehensively i ordered her to disrobe charged as i was with a dark surging force she obeyed me without qualm come to me i said standing before me her eyes lowered she was the very essence of purity i reached out and stroked her breasts let my hand wander down her molded midriff she trembled i went to the windows and closed the blinds that scene was to be repeated time after time so often in fact that i began to neglect the farms i found some excuse to return to the manse during the late morning or before tea time in the afternoon i declined invitations from fredericksburg after awhile i knew that the gentlemen in town were discussing my exploits with approval and that many of them envied me my freedom to expend my energies as i chose still there also was some disapproval after all it was my duty as squire and officer and master of mount vernon to take a bride and to enter legitimately into the social life of the county and in fact i did undertake to pay court to two or three of the eligible young ladies of the region however it was difficult to invest in these relationships anything other than courtesy always it was of the pleasures of my own establishment that i thought still it was possible to own a slaves body and time without owning any part of her that really made a difference to her in time i noted a marked change in flora rather than coming to me in meekness she appeared with a certain reluctance when i commanded her she responded with subdued laughter one morning as i sat on the edge of the bed she suddenly broke into a charming dance circling and undulating about the center of the room when the dance was over she swept up her clothes and ran from the room without my permission as she fled down the stairs i could hear lucybelle shrieking at her berating her what had come over flora what was the reason for her defiance i might have guessed the cause louis thornton spoke to me one evening as we went over the accounts colonel sir i think you ought to know that the slaves are laughing at you down in the quarters that buck akar akar that night after supper i had akar brought up to the yard i had not come facetoface with him since the day i lashed him some two years earlier and he had changed he was now fully grown as powerful as his father thor but more handsome but the greatest change was in the way he looked at me he hated me profoundly it frightened me that someone whom i always thought loved and revered me could despise me so completely but i was master he belonged to me i could do with him as i liked no matter what he thought or how he felt i am going to sell you i told him you have shown that you do not appreciate kindness get your belongings together in the morning mr thornton will take you to the auction at fredericksburg without a word he turned on his heels and marched across the yard back to the quarters s j v it seemed to me that i had just fallen asleep after hours of tossing about when i heard the voice in my room colonel sir please i sat up in bed straining to see in the darkness whos there flora sir the voice said then i saw her standing beside the bed why are you here what do you want i demanded please sir i have come to ask a favor of you a favor yes sir you are going to sell akar sir would you sell me with him will you sell us as a pair fury mounted in me how dare you girl i shouted get out of here at once i will not sell you you will stay here as long as i wish you to she was silent a moment then she said if akar goes i will kill myself i will not live without him i will do what you wish as long as akar is here but i will die if he is sent away i promise you sir with that she moved away and i heard the door close behind her when morning came i gave no orders to louis thornton i mounted a horse and rode off to inspect the farms along the potomac flora and akar had won and so life went on in this way for several years but at i knew that it was past time to alter the pattern it was time to become in fact the eminent and respectable squire of mount vernon the gentleman farmer it helped when flora came to me beaming with joy and announced that she was going to bear akars child tomorrow i will have put all that behind me it has been a dream a fantasy it did not happen at all sitting here on this winter night i have imagined it all yes it was a dream a dream that has ended before it became a nightmare the word came late to the local black artists columbia college a chicago communications school was calling a national conference on arts and the inner city bringing in nonwhite artists social workers and activists from all across in his initial press reby a washington d c firm called j richard taft associates columbia college president mirron alexandroff was quoted as stating the following most of the arts programs in ghetto communities have little relevance to the people living in the communities the programs generally the nation lease handled don t involve them dont reach them and frequently dont even entertain them now for the first time the voices of the inner city will have a forum artists sculptors musicians directors and writers from harlem to watts can tell the establishmen and share with each other their success and failure techniques in the same release names of some of the invited guests were listed novelist john o killens director robert macbeth new lafayette theater in harlem author piri thomas luis valdez director el teatro campesino of del ray california colin carew director the new thing in washington d c and james sherman of the watts writers workshop the release listed the following questions to which the conferees would address themselves what standards for the arts in the inner city whose how can people of the inner city be given opportunity to develop their own art how can engagement with the arts either as participant or audience help individuals to selfesteem to constructive insight into self and society how can the arts bring people into meaningful group and community association can the arts have a conscious constructive relationship to social action when the black chicago artists learned of the projected conference and its programindirectly through contacts in tennessee and new york they were furious they hurriedly got together under the umbrella of the coalition of black revolutionary artists cobra and planned a course of action their fury was based on two main points that a white institution would presume to mount a conference dealing with the artistic needs and direction of black people and that this would be done without any prior consultation with black artists already living and working in the local community for at least one organization in the black community the columbia college conference was particularly grating members of the organizaion of black american culture obac complained that the conference platform sounded as if it had been lifted straight out of the obac statement of purposes a member of obac contacted john o killens in nashville and told him of the feelings of the local black artists when mr killens arrived in chicago on the eve of the conference he called together in his hotel room the other guests of columbia college and told them of the local black artists reaction to the conference the visitors agreed to go along with the local black artists on whatever course of action was decided when the conference opened officially the following day the representatives of cobra were on hand and as the groups serpentine namesake might have done the spokesmen struck the conference a mortal blow taking the floor jeff donaldson denounced the conference as immoral and illegal and pronounced it terminated the visitors joined the local black artists in a black caucus called to draw up a resolution formally ending the conference and the white conferees headed by columbia college teacher harry bouras withdrew to a white caucus to formulate a resolution of their own for tactical reasons the dissenting blacks agreed to allow the conference to proceed with its planned dinner the following night there were two reasons for this the occasion would be perfect for presentation of the resolution from the black caucus and there would be an opportunity to confront dr deton j brooks the black head of the chicago committee on urban opportunity who hadat least partiallyunderwritten the conference in the first place dr brooks was principal speaker at the dinner as a gesture of solidarity among the nonwhites mexican luis valdez was selected to read the resolution from the black caucus here it is western culture can no longer dominate the lives of all men through the devices of racism colonialism and exploitation the reemerging cultures of the third world will define the reality of the future black brown mexican puerto rican and other colonialized people in their communities must decide what art is for themselves therefore the conference which was called arts and the inner city and sponsored by columbia college of chicago had to fail and all other conferences of that nature must fail black brown mexican puerto rican and other colonialized artists will refuse to participate in this kind of exploitation of themselves and their people we support entirely the position of the coalition of black revolutionary artists of chicago which states that black communities must define and control their own culture we contend that only through this kind of definition and control can we achieve human dignity selfrealization and the liberation of our peoples throughout the world it was a historic event for the first time in a formal situation artists from the nonwhite world had served notice that they no longer would submit to the arrogance and presumption of white people in setting standards and judging the legitimacy and validity of their art the repercussions already have been broad and it can be expected that in other parts of the country and the world similar confrontations will take place behind the scenes something equally important was being learned the oldtime hatinhand whiteisalwaysright black leader discovered that his time was over his day in eclipse and that he would have to from now on deal with the angry and militant blacks who are his nemesis also the political powers behind the handkerchief head began to understand even in chicago that the minds of black people are not always for sale the confrontation in chicago was indeed a historical event it is the new thing institutions of higher learning which formerly recognized black people only as creatures to be studied in sociology classes now are reaching out with fivefigure checks and assorted proposals designed to lure black scholars to the faculties and to add black studies to the curricula from yale to the university of florida to stanford to northwestern the gesture is out in the direction of recognizing the reality of black history and culture wondrous is the fallout from the black revolution but revolutions have a way of moving onward and those not caught in the current often find themselves unable to move at the revolutions pace it makes for difficult communication such was the case when a committee of professors in the humanities at the university of chicago under the leadership of german instructor james bruce brought in a contingent of black artists and intellectuals to discuss the possible introduction of a black studies program actually to be more accurate the professors were interested in advice on relevant courses to offer black students in black history and culture it was to have been an all evening conference but for all practical purposes the meeting might have been adjourned after the first half hour playwright leroi jones invited from new jersey as consultant saw to that mr jones gave up the social amenities in matters of black and white some time ago and it was fully in keeping with his style that he got directly to the point you have invited black people here this evening to pick their brains mr jones said in effect but we are not going to let you do that mr jones made it clear that he understood that the professors wanted the black guests to show them the way but he also pointed out that the new way made it necessary that black people do their own thing if the university of chicago is seriously interested in exploring black art history and culture mr jones said then the university must give the money to the black community where organizations and institutions concerned with black art history and culture already are in existence mr jones then referred the professors to the other black consultants at the meeting gerald mcworter a founder of the organization of black american culture obac jeff donaldson representative of the coalition of black revolutionary artists cobra lerone bennett jr ebony senior editor and author of popular books on black history and culture poet don l lee author of two published volumes phil cohran musician and composer leader of the artistic heritage ensemble and founder of the affroarts theater margaret burroughs cofounder of the museum of africanamerican history and art and author artist and teacher curtis ellis bookman and hoyt w fuller negro digest editor there was little else to say the professors had not assembled to hear such a revolutionary proposal and saul bellow the eminent author of herzog and other works was the first to take up his pen and walk most of the other professors remained in a state of shock and puzzlement for another hour or so but the conference for all practical purposes had ended with mr jones introductory remarks one or two of the professors indicated that they would indeed rethink their approach to the whole question of the university and its relationship to the black community which surrounds it and one or two said they thought it a good idea to take mr jones proposal to the university administration there were a few moments of desultory and anticlimactic conversation all around then everybody went back again to doing his thing in recent years it has been increasingly popular for white critics to play down richard wrights contributions to the world not western world of literature indeed these would be critics have literally established their names on firewords thrown at the father of black literature wrights writings have been called everything from comicstrip dogmatization to nonliterature and that in essence is one of the short comings of this biography richard wright by constance webb putnam miss webb doesnt remotely try to enlighten us as to the critical status of wrights work what miss webb does and quite well is give us some personal glimpses of a lifelong friend who happened to be a writer who happened to be richard wright i suggest that newcomers to wright or to the works of wright start with black boy and not this biography miss webb introduces us to wrights family to his early childhood and virtually covers in the first few chapters the same ground as wright did and he in a much better prose form in black boy miss webbs book was very difficult to read and reminded me of a very detailed diary the authors word usage is very uneven and her work is cluttered with incessant quotes of wright in places there is more wright than webb which caused this reader to stop continually and wonder if she had perpetual indigestion it seemed as though every detail regardless of size was painlessly recorded as i understand it miss webb does draw upon a privately printed section of black boy and from wrights diary for the years and hopefully this diary will be published in its entirety in the near future her coverage of wrights association with the john reed clubs and his affiliation with the communist party is valuable in that one can see the direction in which wright was going and one can understand the magnetic hold the party had on him and other black writers which in wrights case was not as deeply rooted as we were led to believe by the mass media and comicbooks wrights associations with marion perkins the black chicago sculptor jack conroy and nelson algren are mentioned but not elaborated upon his friendship with ralph ellison and horace cayton is enlightening yet limited and miss webb does harm to herself as a biographer and to her book as a biography by only superficially hitting on wrights relationship with gertrude stein chester himes langston hughes and of course james baldwin baldwin devotes a number of important essays to his father and one had hoped that this kinship could have been positively dealt with in such a biography wright after fameuncle toms children native son black boy a split with the communist party also recorded in the god that failed the failure of his first marriage and the union in a second marriage with ellen poplar and his reaction to the racial climate in the united statesdecided to take up residence in paris france in paris wright was honored and given the attention that he felt was due him as a writer not a negro writing about black people jeanpaul sartre and gertrude stein introduced him to the various literary circles and for the first few years he was widely interviewed and quoted in the parisian press from his paris base wright began to travel and write nonfiction and social criticism on a much greater scale he traveled most of europe and into the interior of africa his excursion into ghana produced a book black_power which chronicled the african revolution paris did not remain congenial for long wrights writing career did not continue to attract the attention it did in the beginning in fact his next three novels received mixed if not adverse reviews from the press and forced wright to take up other means of support for his family the outsider was considered by some critics to be the first existentialist novel to be published by an american black or white however wright denied this and pointed to his earlier work native son as an example of his first existentialist writings savage holiday and the long dream were immediate failures and enabled the critics to accuse wright of being out of touch with the racial situation in this country as if it had radically changed since wrights departure the reality is that wright never was really out of touch he consistently criticized and hammered at the hypocrisy of the american way due to his unpopular insistence of truth wright acquired many enemies in high places wrights problem was that he never really ceased being a native son and in the final analysis a very unhappy one during his travels wright attracted an amoebic infection and along with his financial and racial problems his health began to fail he was taken by a fatal heart attack in the father was miss webb i feel failed as a biographer her book in no way can be considered complete her friendship with wright and his family undoubtedly clouded her writing and vision her objectivity if there is such an animal was subordinated and punctured by the authors personal point of view she incessantly quotes wright presents lively conversations and is forever introducing us to new and exciting people but throughout all this communication of the mans relationships the biographer gives us no real interpretation of them or of his work she doesnt under or overestimate wrights creative power and she virtually leaves the reader in a state of wonderment the definitive biography of richard wright has not been written and it may take a native son to write it miss webbs book was the authorized biography and one can only hope that the information that was accessible to miss webb will be extended to others who may seek to explore the man the photography was a joy and i found the bibliography quite helpful to read the actual works of richard wright is to read the only complete biography of the man and i feel at this time we would do ourselves justice by doing this first from uncle toms children to lawd today from paris to the south side of chicago we are assured that he richard wright was always a native son in prose or in his use of the hokku haiku i am nobody a red sinking autumn sun took my name away don l lee
if anyone originally y doubted the prospects for success of the old civil_rights movement his initial suspicions have certainly materialized in the events of the last two years the revolutions in the black ghetto the waning influence and effectiveness of oldguard negro spokesmen and the increasing antiblack mood of congressall of these events have signalled the end of an era the old movements engine of change guided as it was by the integrationassimilation school of social engineers is on its way to the junkyard of social movement apparatus and perhaps black historians will render the following autopsy having promised the black community far more than attainable with its ineffective propulsion system the derailed engine of change succumbed to dual assaults from militantly impatient blacks and tenaciously adamant whites sursum corda in spite of the inability of the old engine to muster the powerful propulsion necessary to sustain itself it has nevertheless given birth to forces which look most promising in terms of being capable of moving the black community toward human dignity and respect and a much fuller participation in americas economic and political systems the flames of black consciousness and black identity are spreading through the community like wildfire the new mood symbolized by this refreshing black awareness provides us with clues as to what will be the most effective components in the new engine of change that must be constructed for the next phase of the movement all great social upheavals have had their theorists and indispensable vanguard of intellectuals and the new movement must have a similar core of those who are comfortable in the world of social theory on an organizational level such persons are comparable to engineers whose function it is to ferret out elements in a given problem according to esoteric quantitative methodology and when the appropriate methodology is inadequate such professional engineers create new quantitative frameworks that will aid in the solution of the problem a technical organization without its engineering department is likely to be a shortlived entity doomed to failure because of a predictable lack of imaginative and innovative solutions to its complex technical problems similarly a social movement without its theorists can move only so far before it begins to suffer from lack of spirit and clearly defined goals perhaps much of the problem with the old engine of change was that the avowed goalsintegration now and its accompanying accoutrementswere largely irrelevant to the vast majority of blacks as the old engine creaked along its tracks it became more and more obvious to the black masses that the right to live in suburbia was less urgent than the right to man a decent job wherever that job was located so one extremely healthy result of the derailment of the old engine is that goals have been reevaluated and new priorities are being assessed for the vehicle which will propel the new movement and no matter what those goals may turn out to be it is clear that grass roots participation in the black community will be crucial to the success of the new movement and it is on the level of grass roots participation that the new movement could be vulnerable social theorists and intellectuals invaluable and indispensable though they are are not noted for their willingness to dig deep into the practical mechanics of social revolution such is necessarily not the nature of their calling again the new movement can be compared to a technical organization once the engineer has specified or created the quantitative framework within which the problem is to be solved he turns it over to his technical assistantsthe technicians it is the technician who adapts the engineers framework so that it be comes a viable means of accomplishing the task and the same type of division of responsibilities job specialization if you will must be evident in the new movement the technician in the movement is as yet a rare breed partly because far too many blacks have not done enough serious thinking to realize that they too have a definite place in the new engine of change our task then if we wish the new engine to have the necessary internal propulsion is to define the role of the technician and identify those who are qualified to fill that role the technician within the framework of the new movement deals with the task of increasing of the power base of the black community on its most basic most mundane level whether he is involved in a school betterment project or in a training project for existing and potential black businessmen his role remains that of working with the people where the people live at times he may be required to be a provocateur prodding the community into action on issues which have been the focus of much lively discussion but little direct action and this may well be the most frustrating task of the technician because of the apathy that still afflicts the black community overcoming the apathy of the black masses will not be an easy task but it is a vital step in the liberation process the psychological shackles that bind our peoples minds must be loosened before we can hope to remove the more blatant shackles of economic and political deprivation once the walls of apathy are destroyed the technicians role gravitates from provocation to organization it is axiomatic that a social movement will falter and crumble unless there is a viable nexus of grass roots organizations that channel the objectives of an aroused community although the black community is beginning to respond to this historically oppressive system with a new resolve to control its own environment and make those whose actions affect the community responsible to it i have grave misgivings about the direction of the response like an escaped tiger the black community may lash out with such devastating fury that it may well engender white retaliations of such brutal massiveness that hitlers systematic genocide of the jews will seem like a german lovein by comparison and this very point deserves a further comment despite all the assertions about the efficacy of riots look at all the money they poured into watts after the revolution we delude ourselves and do our posterity a grave disservice by recommending or embracing riots as a longrun solution to our oppressive conditions there is a distinct logical inconsistency in the notion that riots which we quite rightly assert are brought on by the brutality and callousness of white society are the appropriate means of bringing that society to its senses for given the callousness and viciousness of white society the inevitable result of successive riots will not be to shock whites into reasonableness rather it will be to cause them to move swiftly to equip their police forces with more efficient weaponry and those of us who watched closely the white reaction to the recent revolutions and to the april outbreaks realize that even now police forces in nearly every major city are being supplied with such weaponry as armored vehicles special gases and electric nets to speak of riotous intimidation to a society which is wellversed in the arts of hideous oppression is to provide that society with an excuse to do what years of slavery and years of de facto slavery could not doannihilate black americans this is a harsh fact but one that must be borne in mind when we consider the particular engine that is to go into the new movement when seen in proper perspective riots are only a shortrun means of exposing the seriousness of the american race dilemma at the point that awareness is aroused in the white community and active concern developed in the black community riots as a tool of social change must be relegated to the tool shed already in the shed are many tools of the old movement including the genus of sitins lieins demonstrations and polite begging failure or reluctance of the engineers and technicians of the new movement to relinquish ineffective weapons will result in psychological disaster in the black community when the people realize that the movement isnt moving witness the fate of those who chauffeured the vehicle of the old movement and consider the disillusionment that permeated the community when it became evident that the putative civil_rights movement was not only riding in the wrong vehicle of change but also was headed in the wrong direction and there was undoubtedly a causal relationship between the two erroneous strategies what then is a possible new tool for the movement an assessment of recent eventsie the sporadic revolutions and the subsequent reactions of the white communityindicates that tactical militancy and veiledthreat diplomacy are potentially potent weapons for the immediate future the riots have shaken the entire fabric of the society the white power structure has finally roused itself to the fact that recurring seasonal disturbances are a distinct possibility furthermore whites realize that short of complete extermination of blacks the riots can never be totally prevented given the power structures desire for law and orderwhich is functional tor a prosperous economic systemwe can expect whites to use a combination of coercion and concessions in attempts to obviate riots thus the new engineers and technicians must be adamant in demanding meaningful concessions and competent in meeting subtle coercion with equally subtle reminders that city hall can be ravaged just as easily as the corner grocery store this is the dangerous game of brinkmanship and there are those who will denounce it as radical but is the problem itself any less radical malcolm_x was quite correct when he stated that the history of this nation is but a study of the efficacy of raw power mercilessly and relentlessly applied nothingsave perhaps the dollar and law and orderis as highly respected in america as raw power if we must wave the bloody shirt to minimize the possibilities of more shirts being bloodied and if this strategy proves effective then the ethnics and morality of doing so become highly irrelevant the day of fighting white power as manifested in police brutality ghetto retroeducation job discrimination etc with love power is behind us the essence of leadership is the ability to use whatever power the constituents have as a fulcrum in winning greater power the black communitys greatest power at the moment is not the fact of a riot but the omnipresent threat of a riot for the reality of a riot can be swiftly crushed but to crush the threat of a riot entails removal of the oppressive conditions which cause them this distinction must be borne in mind our definition of the role of technicians requires that these persons command those skills which are in short supply in the black community it is only too evident that these technical skills are in greatest abundance in the great middleclass specifically the negro middle class nmc a careful analysis of what the new black has wrought the ghetto in terms of white assistance reveals that success in recruiting nmc technicians may be crucial to the viability of the entire new movement when whites found their grip on the old engine slipping they couldnt get out of the ghetto soon enough to be sure some whites have been drawn into the ghetto as a result of the revolutions but the exodus has exceeded the influx and this causes us no real regret because the black community can do without the type of white assistance which arrives with too many strings attached eclectism in receiving white assistance is in keeping with the new mood of the black community the very nature of the new spirit demands that whites who would serve the black community in various capacities be in the words of roxburys brian rollins properly sensitized the black community must be certain that white teachers as an example who would instruct our youngsters know enough black history to counterbalance george washington with the great kings of ancient african empires abraham lincoln with nat turner and marcus garvey eli whitney with charles drew and george washington carver and so on and since teachers impart culture as well teach subjects perhaps the black community should demand that they be properly tuned into afroamerican culture before they are allowed to go prancing down to the neighborhood school we must be certain that we do not attract a new flood of slum tourists and dilettantes who upon discovering that blacks no longer worship at the altar of white society haul themselves off to haightashbury for pot pleasures or back home to rejoin physically the society they never left psychologically the necessity of sensitizing white technicians is an integral part of the surge to place complete control over the destiny of blacks in the hands of blacks while whites muse and debate over the advisability of surrendering themselves to a sensitizing process as a condition for being technicians in the new movement the construction of the new engine must go on hence we return to the previously mentioned negro middle class nmcthe black bourgeoisie as e franklin frazier dubbed them how can we tap the reservoir of technical skills that lie dormant in the nmc can the traditionally aloof and indifferent nmc be drawn into the new engine an unmistakable result of the sporadic revolutions was the terror that gripped the nmc communities the insecurities and vulnerabilities that accompany the social statuses of the nmc were heightened by the fiery demonstrations of the lumpenproletariat the black bourgeoisie has been knocking on the door of white society for decades yet the revolutions found them still pounding frantically for admission the fact that the walls which surround the nmc psyche were shaken is a testimony to the efficacy of the black_power mood indications are that the nmc is no longer sure that its goal of complete assimilation into the white society is realistic or even desirable no less a personality than the president of the national congress of negro women has admonished her convention to cut back on the teas and fashion shows and to get involved in a meaningful way in the problems of the ghetto and even ralph bunche phd has become more willing to identify with the chronic problems of the black community it would appear then that the new mood of black militancythat sanctus spirituo of the new movementis a very powerful mover indeed if we have read the nmc signs of insecurity correctly then we can appeal to them on at least two levels the most basic level is that of enlightened selfinterest the nmc can be shown that their vulnerability is of a dual nature they know only too well that had baldwin hills been located near watts it is probable that the nmc would have suffered both the ravaging strokes of the revolutionists and the savage retaliation of the police forces and the possibility that future riots may spread beyond the ghetto causes the nmc even more discomfort hence this dual vulnerability becomes a wedge by which we can pry them loose from the steppes of pseudowhite society and make them effective components in the new engine of change on another level they can be recruited on the basis of appeals to their desires to be a part of something significant there is undeniable status attached to meaningful activity of any sort and the nmc members seek that status as vigorously as does white society they can be shown that accomplishments in the new movement of black progress can be as personally rewarding as achievements in other spheres of nmc life couple this appeal with the previously given choice of acting or being savagely reacted to and we eventually compel them to drive their long cars right down funky funky broadway where they will emerge trembling and illatease unaware that they have indeed finally arrived as implied in everything that we have said about the nmc and their role in the new engine of change the black community will not accept the nmc as spokesmen for the movement if the cause of dignity of full participation for the black masses is to be promoted with the candor and vigor that is necessary the nmc is hardly qualified to tell it like it is their role must remain that of providing technical assistance to the largely underdeveloped and overexploited black community spokesmen for the new movement will emerge from the black ghetto itself so white society and the nmc should ready themselves to accept these indigenous spokesmen there is no choice the remaining largely untapped source of technical assistance are the expanding numbers of black collegians whounlike the present nmchave been reared under two ideological phases of the movement for black equality they have witnessed the little rocks the impressive march on washington and the selmas and they have seen the old guard of integrationists fall victim to the very goals for which they were strivingassimilation having experienced a far more intimate and sustained encounter with the working of white society than had the older generation these students find the charms of the majority group wholly superficial hypocritical and generally irrelevant black students increasingly reject the notion that everything and anything of value necessarily lies in white society more willing to be critical than their parents black students have proclaimed defunct the integrationassimilation apparatus constructed by earlier engineers of the movement they seek salvation outside the loss of identity of that integration must entail the emergence of allblack organizations on predominantly white campuses and the new surge of black militancy on predominantly black campuses see robert a malsons article on the black_power rebellion at howard university in december negro digest are manifestations of the restive nononsense mood of black collegians finding a heretofore unrecognized common bond of strength that makes for a new esprit de corps black students appear anxious to involve themselves in community projects while some black student groups have found their own projects to work others have been content to let the sanctus spirituo of the new movement drift around the halls of academe like a drunken apparitionelated but anomalous the massiveness of the task and the paucity of black resources necessitate a more economical and efficient use of these black student organizations the skills which they are learningwhether those skills be in business law sociology engineering or whatevercan be readily utilized in the black community if existing programs do not provide the framework within which black student skills can be effectively utilized then it is the duty of the new movement engineers to construct frameworks in new programs equipped with a drive shaft of black engineers the new engine of change is set to propel the new movement in directions which the black community must move ie toward economic and political power the drive will not be an easy one and casualties will occur but for the vision of a better tomorrow the new movement will move ondriven by an indomitable engine of black unity during the last years y n of the life of w e b du bois i had the good fortune to live just a few garden hedges away from the great man and his wife shirley graham every afternoon he insisted on taking a ride through ghanas countryside and occasionally i went with him i never got over my awe of him and i was usually tonguetied in his presence feeling i was sitting not with a mere man but with history sometimes though i summoned enough courage to ask him if he had known this or that black intellectual or political figure from the late th century when he had begun his lifes work usually dr du bois had known the person mentioned and more often than not he would say a very fine man he did very good work but and here he would shake his head sadly he never wrote enough the good doctor believed that a tragic shortcoming of black men of affairs had so often been their failure to leave behind them the written record of what they had done a legacy he knew to be so much more valuable than wealth and property because upon it future generations could plan and build with a knowledge of what their fathers had done today most of us are keenly aware of these shortcomings and the appearance of a new book by a black author is almost always an event to be hailed especially is this true when the book is a work of criticism an area in which we have not yet achieved distinction if its author is a man of mature years whom we know has been a close observer of the scene he describes we open the book with great expectations the crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruses first book begins with such promise it is a thick book nearly pages expensive liberally sprinkled with footnotes and supported by both an index a list of supplementary biographical sources and a postscript on black_power its subject matter plus its impressive production guarantees that it will be a brisk seller especially on college campuses where interest in what black intellectuals are thinking is high but books about them very scarce for these reasons one regrets the painful necessity of having to report that the crisis of the negro intellectual despite its promise and all its builtin advantages is a glaring failure and worse a ship that has sailed into port under false colors it has come not to lead us into serious inquiry about the basic problems facing black intellectuals and black people in general but to destroy the victims of this destructive thrust are not the valid ones of wrong obsolete and untenable ideas and attitudes but a long list of artists and intellectuals many of them dead whom mr cruse happens not to like we have the authors own word for it almost alone of black intellectuals he has kept the flames of black nationalism burning while the rest have been dancing the boogaloo to alien ideologies cruses main thesistrue enough as far as it goes but not at all originalis that there have usually been two political tendencies which have existed in black communities the drive towards full integration and equality in the majority white community as opposed to the separatist black nationalist movements according to cruse the nationalist movements have been continually frustrated by an evil coalition conspiratorial in nature between the whites of the communist party and a succession of notsobright black writers acting as willing or duped agents of the communists among these agents he manages to include nearly every black writer who has published a book or had a play produced since mr cruse himself began his long apprenticeship as an author it may seem unkind to suggest that the author has labored over this long work primarily to settle old scores with more successful colleagues but even a casual glance at his table of contents and index makes this conclusion inescapable for example the life of du bois spanned nearly years he wrote so much that no library in the world has succeeded in compiling a complete bibliography of his works he was unquestionably the greatest intellectual ever produced by black america and outside his own country he is generally recognized as one of the great western thinkers a product of the age before specialization his work ranged over a large number of disciplines and arts from philosophy psychology sociology and history at the one end to journalism novels and poetry at the other he was not only the father but the grandfather of us all and his impact on the black american whether intellectual or not was so profound that we all bear his stamp it goes without saying that any author purporting to seriously analyze the crisis of black intellectuals throughout american history must devote major attention to such a giant how then can one explain that there is an entire chapter devoted to the crucifixion of the late lorraine hansberry author of two plays a raisin in the sun and the sign in sidney brusteins window while there is no chapter on du bois of course mr cruse must refer to the old man but there are only references to du bois while there are to a young woman whose artistic life tragically spanned less than five years although lorraine was not noted for maidenly modesty she would have been the first to protest that cruse was giving her too much attention and she would have been too kind to draw the conclusion that what really bothered her critic was not her ideological peculiarities but the tremen dous commercial success achieved by her play a raisin in the sun to be fair mr cruse may have some justification for the dislike of miss hansberry at the height of her success mr cruse asked her to read a musical play he had written presumably with the idea that she as a new celebrity and rolling in bread might help him get it on the boards lorraine with characteristic candor declined the honor of reading it saying she didnt know anything about musicals as a fellow writer i can imagine how annoyed cruse must have been for just now i have a play knocking around which i know is the greatest thing written since will shakespeare checked out but even some of my socalled best friends persist in being jackasses by stubbornly disagreeing with me and i am considering devoting a chapter to each one of them in my next book many of the new militants are excited about the cruse book and impatient with greybeards like this reviewer who refuses to confine himself to the issues raised within the book naturally the new militants want to get on with it and like most of todays students are not much interested in anything that happened before they got out of high school but to concentrate only on the issues would be as simpleminded as to confine a discussion of the johnson war in vietnam to mr johnsons latest state of the union message in the book as in the message there are so many distortions spiteful inferences and downright lies that serious intellectual exchange becomes impossible because we are forced to speculate on the basic honesty and integrity of the author there are plenty of eyewitnesses to the murderous fiasco being acted out in asia but the ranks of those who were present at some of the events mr cruse describes are thinning and it is imperative that while a few of us are still about we set the record straight for example it is impossible to understand many of the postworld war ii events in harlem the clash of ideology between black and white marxists on the one hand and the black nationalists on the other unless one understands the vital role cruse himself played in these events yet the author after describing nearly everybody else as a ccc cardcarrying communist especially personalities who might be harmed by the charge shows a strange reluctance to appear on stage himself to anyone who doesnt know writers such reticence may at first seem admirable but the rest of us detect a peculiar and not very pleasant smell so lets take a closer look at the chapter origins of the dialogue cruse describes how in august the harlem writers club a dissident group which had split with the more orthodox marxistoriented committee for the negro in the arts demanded that the harlem political left wing establish a harlem cultural commission to oversee the complicated and aggravated situation in the community the rejected strain of nationality consciousness was in conflict with the integrationist trend over community cultural policies backed to the hilt by the party line this heated battle was carried into the communist partys harlem headquarters by the chairman of the club myself that is to say cruse and the cochairman unless the reader actually knows he may get the idea that this is a confrontation between black nationalists and communists with cruse a lonely churchillian figure arguing for black autonomy from the backbenches but it isnt that at all this is an intracommunist party struggle which could only have occurred between communists for why on earth would a dedicated group of black nationalists seek the permission of the interracial communist party to operate in harlem where presumably they the black nationalists would have deeper roots and greater strength this is where the question of honesty comes in at no point does mr cruse tell his readers what they have a right to know what indeed all of us who were there already know certainly it is no secret from the interested intelligence agencies of the federal government from whom presumably mr cruse is not now seeking employment this knowledge is that in he was an upandcoming marxist theoretician not a black nationalist and not a mere rankandfiler like the rest of us i can remember how we youngsters looked up to him because he functioned on a policymaking level speaking from a background of such authority cruse could no doubt tell us more than he has in his book and the average reader would understand how he came to know so much as we have already decided i hope not prematurely that cruse is not bucking for a job in washington my only conclusion is that he wants to be sure he is in step with the younger militants by establishing a background that he has always been antiwhite and antiintegrationist if i am right this is a great pity for there is no reason for any black intellectual of mr cruses age to be ashamed of the fact that he once believed in the possibility of american social and political regeneration which could be achieved by something less than total revolution men are not born revolutionaries nearly always they become that long after they have considered attempted and finally abandoned every other option i think it is a healthy development that militant black youths set the pace today but it ought to be generally recognized that the world they are determined to change was not created in and that they and their conclusions are the end products of several generations of struggle and development thus it seems to this reviewer that mr cruse ought to be proud of the fact that in the late forties he was among the first of the young blacks to challenge white power in the american communist party the fact that he did not at the time coin the slogan black_power is no mark against him catchy phrases seem to drop from heaven franklin roosevelts ringing declaration that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself is said to have been lifted bodily from a macys department store advertisement mr cruse and some of his friends were among the first to recognize that the party slogan negro and white unity was inconsistent with the realities of the black community by this i mean that the ideal of the u s communist party of uniting under one banner black and white urban and rural workers was simply beyond realization because it did not take into account the profound and qualitative importance of race in the american situation that the most miserable white considered himself the superior of the most accomplished black that in a time of crisis the whites would be bound to throw in their lot with the white power structure and that blacks had to be organized as blacks under black direction these conclusions which seem so obvious now were a long time in the making spanning several generations and my only point here is that if one happens to have been unfortunate enough to have been a gleam in his daddys eye in the twenties instead of the forties he has nothing to be ashamed of especially if he played an honorable part in the development of black political thought here is the rub here again is where the knowledge of what actually happened on a personality level prevents this reviewer from considering only the issues raised in the book and forces him to question the motives of the author at the time to which we are referring mr cruse had written a play im sure it was a very fine play but the left wing offbroadway theater groups which were the only ones encouraging black writers then had all turned it down naturally the aspiring playwright was very bitter understandably so and a reviewer in cant help but wonder whether or not the authors current and bitter antimarxism is not more personal than ideological otherwise how are we to explain these contradictions that in when he was leading an anticommunist black nationalist struggle he was at the same time asking the white communistcontrolled theatre groups to produce his play that more than a decade after lorraine hansberry as cruse implies revealed herself to be hopelessly integrationist and a puppet of the white marxists he was asking her to lend her name prestige and money in support of his musical play these questions far from being petty probably reveal the wellsprings of the book a phenomenon of our age is that men trapped in the rush of events are frequently forced to hide or denounce the noblest acts of their lives thus people who understood the growing threat of world fascism in the nineteenthirties are hesitant about acknowledging that they once supported the republican cause in spain and some of the men who took up guns and went away to risk their lives in the faraway hills near barcelona and madrid are ashamed to admit it today because the prevailing american attitude is that it was all a communist plot yet those were to use the maudlin phrase the best years of their lives it is a curious twist of history that middleaged black men should also hide their past ideological commitments for they have nothing to gain by it except the contempt of their colleagues and of their white enemies who could not care less what these blacks did or years ago in the crisis of the negro intellectual the author frequently calls attention to apparent contradictions in positions taken by w e b du bois inexplicably writes cruse on page he dubois joined in the decimated ranks of the american communist partya violent aboutface for a man who had spent the s and the s rejecting communism and again on page the reason that the debate on black economy has gone back and forth for years with no conclusions reached is because the idea is closely linked with nationalism and the integrationists would rather be tarred and feathered than suspected of the nationalist taint this was the great weakness of w e b du boisthe only real flaw in the mans intellectual equipment du bois upheld the idea of a separate black economy as not so easily dismissed because in the first place we have already got a partially separate economy in the united states yet he remarked in that his economic program for negro advance can easily be mistaken for a program of complete racial segregation and even nationalism among negroes this is a misapprehension if one can so completely miss the point about the greatest black intellectual whose thoughts are mostly gathered in libraries available to cruse there is small wonder that he is constantly off the beam about lesser mortals a man who lived from to and whose entire productive life was concerned with the advancement of his people might very well be expected to have changed his mind frequently far be it for me to remind mr cruse of the philosophers admonition that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds the du bois odyssy spreads over the entire history of the united states since the first civil war which ended in he was neither an integration nor a black nationalist he was too great a genius to be encompassed under petty labels all of his prodigious energies were devoted to bringing the human race especially the ethnic section of it to which he belonged from darkness into light he was never a man of fashion and it would not have bothered him for one moment that a position he had taken on monday turned out to be wrong on tuesday he would simply have changed his position for he was in the best sense of the word a social scientist who drew his conclusions from all of the available hard evidence fully cognizant as the genuine scientists are that todays conclusions may be proved false by tomorrows discoveries du bois never claimed to have found a solution to the economic problems of the black man in the united states economics was not one of his disciplines and even if it had been in all probability he would have failed to anticipate as did all the master thinkers of his time the nations incredible technological achievement that would dislocate the traditional relation ship between labor and production and make the black worker and not a small number of white workers not only unwanted but obsolete this development alone not to mention the concurrent and related worldwide expansion of the american empire creates profound and complex problems for those attempting to chart the future of the black man in the united states happily mr cruse is keenly aware of the implications of these developments and reveals himself at his intellectual best in the chapter capitalism revisited where he offers a devastating analysis of the economic philosophy of the black bourgeoisie as represented by businessman hope stevens and the ultraconservative journalist george s schuyler who has never forgiven roosevelt for the new deal quite rightly mr cruse calls to our attention the best if limited contribution that du bois made in the area of economics in his autobiography dust of dawn where in the words of cruse du bois outlined a whole new concept of what he called the cooperative commonwealth for the american negro yet this very important aspect of du boiss thinking is never even mentioned today by the various black intellectual worshippers of the du bois tradition cruses main contribution in this chapter is to call attention to the poverty of serious analysis of the black mans economic situation by writers and politicians of either the left or the right as the reader may have gathered my reaction to the crisis of the negro intellectual has been mostly negative and i welcome the opportunity to applaud a section of the book in this chapter serious inquiry replaces the settling of old grudges and mr cruses prowess in the area of economics suggests that he may have a good deal more to offer certainly we need all the help we can get elsewhere in the book mr cruse makes another positive contribution when he calls attention to our unhealthy tendency to worship and praise our heroes and spokesmen uncritically the best of our leaders and the cause of liberation would have been better served had all of them been subjected to searching analysis of the quality mr cruse calls for in his book like most men who have lived full lives du bois probably did a lot of things he would not want to take any credit for today after dinner with him one evening in accra i was in the process of making some rather angry remarks about roy wilkins who i believe is still the executive secretary of the naacp i have forgotten what idiotic act prompted my emotional outburst but i recall very vividly that the old man held up his hand and asked me to keep quiet i wanted to know what right w e b du bois had to curtail julian mayfields freedom of speech he explained that it made him feel guilty to hear me attack roy wilkins for in the s he du bois had been responsible for bringing mr wilkins a middle western journalist to the attention of the naacp hierarchy in new york i was astounded for all i knew about his relations with roy wilkins was that the younger man had dropped du bois when the whites in washington had decided finally and forever that they didnt like him i apologized for speaking angrily against mr wilkins and sought to console the good doctor after all said if it should turn out that dr du bois and i were both wrong and that there was indeed a heaven somewhere st peter would probably forgive w e b du bois for the wilkins error even the greatest of men make mistakes the point of this story is that there is nothing in the life which has been honestly lived that should be ignored if history happens to take any account of you i dont of course mean petty things but those aspects of your life that touch on your work if a man like du bois could confess that he was responsible for bringing roy wilkins to new york then certainly people like cruse and myself ought to have the guts to admit to murder or rape backing the cause of racial integration and the correction of social injustice whether the victim is white or black may be unfashionable and uncle tomish now but there was a time not so long ago when it was downright dangerous as i approach the age of forty i dont want to blot out many of my most cherished experiences merely to seem current or camp i dont regret that i was at least a face in the protesting crowds a signature on petitions and finally a mourner at the funeral during the crucible of julius and ethel rosenberg not for a moment do i feel regret that with hundreds of others i trudged around the white house with my miserable signs protesting the death sentences passed on the martinsville seven black boys condemned for the rape of a white woman in virginia willie mcgee executed for raping a white woman or the trenton six whose alleged crime i dont remember mindless and emotional some of this may seem to those who stood aloof but i like to think that we would still pile into cars and speed headlong up to the peekskill riots to challenge incipient american fascism which was trying to prevent paul robeson from giving a concert not for anything would i trade the ugly and bizarre memory of watching peekskills negro elks standing between the local ku klux klan and the american legion all of them shouting at us to go back to russia where we came from it was good to be alive then and committed to the ideal of destroying political and social injustice just as it is now mr cruse would have us believe that the reds and the integrationists conspired in the destruction of the american negro theater ant and that the principal instruments of this destruction were the actors who deserted for the greenerlooking fields downtown such an assertion is transparently ridiculous i recall those days very well and no black actor in the country was so busy that he could not have accepted engagements uptown and across town and still have had time to spare there just werent that many roles available as there arent now except for a few individuals moreover anyone who has been on the periphery of the theatre as long as mr cruse has ought to know that there is never a shortage of actors playwrights and producers yes actors never but let us assume for the sake of argument that mr cruse is correct that the departure of certain actors had a disastrous effect on cn awhat was to prevent those who remained from carrying on or even organizing a new theatre you certainly didnt need communist party permission or money to operate in harlem in those days all you needed was faith in a play the will to try and plenty of elbow grease maxie glanville ossie davis and i embarked on disastrous theatrical ventures more than once the intrepid gertrude jeanette was practically a onewoman company writer producing and directing her own plays writer loften mitchell was the busiest legit theaterperson in harlem neither asking nor needing the permission of anyone to write produce direct and fail as we all did actressplaywright alice childress had a number of plays produced in little theaters one of them florence is i believe a permanent addition to our literature as actors and writers we worked on broadway and off way downtown and way uptown wherever we could find work and get training in our crafts we lost every penny we could beg or borrow but at least a few plays got done some of them not without artistic merit it is now nearly years since the collapse of the american negro theatre surely within this time mr cruse and his associates could have come up with a play hired a hall called the actors together and put it on however if this thought has occurred to them there is no evidence of it but except for his chapter capitalism revisited mr cruse is not concerned with constructive effort he is clearly out to settle scores with those who it seems to him have made it up the ladder apparently at his expense thus of this impressive number of hopefuls in ant only a small handful are around today to boast of some success in the theatreruby dee ossie davis sidney poitier alice childress maxwell glanville harry belafonte and frederick oneal interestingly enough with the exception of oneal all these survivors found their pathway to later prominence in the integrated theatre through the harlem political left wings cruse even professes to see something sinister in the fact that some of these people later worked together the left wing cultural forces had moved into postwar prominence sidney poitier was soon to be seen on the stages of a theatre operated by cna the committee for the negro in the arts he was also featured offbroadway in longitude written by a white left wing playwright some ten years later poitier along with ruby dee and later ossie davis were stars of lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun it is hardly coincidence that to this day the names of poitier davis dec and others repeatedly turn up in juxtaposition what are we to make of such a statement is it paranoia or simple ignorance of show business realities that the names of davis and dee repeatedly turn up in juxtaposition should surprise no one they follow the same profession and have been married to one another for nearly years and surely harold cruse knows that no black actor not even academy awardwinning poitier and only a handful of white superstars are in a position to make basic decisions in the motion picture or television industries that the very nature of commercial show business in our system requires that the producer think first of the biggest names he can get if he is to be able to raise the money to make his picture or get his show on the boards and that the fact that there are so few black actors of any prominence makes it inevitable that they will appear together over and over again if it is all a left wing conspiracy as the author suggests we must be prepared to believe that the great banks of wall street are involved in it for it is they who ultimately determine what pictures are made for the mass media like mr cruse i envy those who have made a bundle of money and won fame in the business to which i once aspired but as a student of the american system he should understand that they are no more to blame for their success than they are for his failure such a system will never permit the emergence of more than a limited number of firstclass black talents and that is why over the generations we have lost so many brilliant artists who simply had to give up because there was no place for them the crisis of the negro intellectual is a long book and an adequate review of it would have to be about as long for on almost every page and in almost every footnote there are distortions malevolent misinterpretations andit must be saidoutright lies in the rest of my space i can call attention to only a few of these concentrating on matters about which i have personal knowledge unfortunately i wasnt born when claude mckay was working on his poem if we must die and it never occurred to me until read this book to wonder if the poem had been written under the influence of the communist party but apparently this is a question of inexhaustible fascination for mr cruse and on page after dreary page he offers extensive documentation on the communist connections of every major and minor black figure in literature the number of people on mr cruses crap list is inexhaustible and includes an entire ethnic group west indians whom the author holds largely responsible for the downfall of marcus garvey himself a son of the islands the inestimable enrichment of afroamerican culture and intellectuality by west indians amounts to nothing in mr cruses eyes because some of them had the good sense to read and be influenced by the ideas of karl marx shooting from the hip the author draws his pistols and fires two chapters one at west indians in general and the other at richard b moore now an elderly bookshop keeper in harlem who was a socialist as far back as and according to cruse a founder of the american communist party to make matters worse he is also a west indian this reviewer with the historian john henrik clarke novelist john o killens and political leader robert f williams come in for special attention from mr cruse the author reminds me that in i interviewed miss ruby dee for the newspaper freedom and that i neglected to ask her why she left the american negro theatre in that happens to be the year i was graduated from high school and fully two years before i ever heard of miss dee or ant his inference is that her departure was part of the red integrationist plot to destroy ant that is of course a possibility but isnt it more likely that she left broadway for the same reason that mr cruse took his book downtown to a white publisher there are hardly any black publishers just as until recently there was not a single black producing company that could offer anything but occasional work to black actors one should also remember that in miss dee was hardly a star and wonderful actress though she is there was no reason why a healthy theatre company should have collapsed just because she left on page mr cruse claims he visited the offices of freedom and left with a feeling of desolation and angry disgust at the cliquish remoteness from changing reality that pervaded this newspaper one could plainly see that its writers were intellectual prisoners of the dying left wing movement dutifully and blindly obeying the mandate to hang on but at the same time they were preparing for their own grand exit into the integrated cultural world and what in fact could one expect the sentiments of killens hansberry dee mayfield clarke and company to bewhen the great intellectual scholar dr w e b du bois had given his official sanction to freedom newspaper in miss hansberry was just over years old and very junior at freedom none of the rest of the company he mentions was ever on the staff of freedom though the writers among us might have contributed an occasional article but here the wary reader will ask himself what was harold cruse doing at the office of freedom in the first place this is three years after the ant betrayal the newspaper is marxistoriented and on the staff are a number of people who mr cruse knows to be hopelessly committed to the cause of integration why is he there among the enemy the answer is partly obvious like the rest of us struggling writers he has taken his manuscript to wherever there was a chance of getting it printed and the editors of freedom have been shortsighted enough to reject yet another cruse creation no wonder he left with a feeling of desolation and angry disgust every rejection slip affects me the same way to harold cruse the selfdefense movement of robert f williams in monroe north carolina was a monumental fiasco unquestionably he is right if he means that we did not win our ultimate objective which was to gain more power for the blacks of union county and that some were forced to flee the country if victory could be vouchsafed to militants our ranks would no doubt be overflowing on the other hand if young black militants have any idea that mr cruse as critic represents the wave of the future that he is a sort of latterday frantz fanon they had better read page where he reveals that he is now just as terrified of whiteys power as he has been over the last two decades no vision of the proletarian revolution whether in mayfields black tones or in white leftist tones can seriously project overthrowing the federal structure it is so powerfully big that even the conservative right wing is worried to the point of extreme apoplexy the cumulative effect of the charges mr cruse levels against the present reviewer is that i have not yet succeeded in formulating a comprehensive ideology of struggle for black americans of course he is absolutely correct i dont want to quibble but neither has he formulated such an ideology and as a writer he has had many more years in which to accomplish this than i have i have left the cuban experience until last because the incident is to me the key to what makes harold cruse run it is july and a group of american writers are guests of the revolutionary government in the sierra maestra among the writers are john henrik clarke cruse leroi jones and myself for weeks fidel and his comrades have exhorted the cuban people to make a pilgrimage to these mountains from which he launched his revolution the target number to make the pilgrimage is but the new government does not expect that many people and has made no plans to get them off the mountains however there is an euphoria over cuba and the people take fidel at his words weeks before the july th celebration they begin to make their way up the roads to the mountains nearly a million people a sixth of the entire population are there posing a monumental problem for the young leaders who have underestimated their own popularity when the celebration is over the narrow roads are jammed and the single railroad taxed far beyond its capacity because everyone is trying to leave at the same time there is hardly any food or water and to make matters worse the carbine of a young militiaman has been accidentally discharged and shot up the main water pump so everybody is hot dirty hungry and thirsty despite the use of helicopters and trucks screaming up and down the roads it remains an almost impossible task to meet the gastronomic and sanitation needs of so many people guests of the government are taken care of first but still there is considerable inconvenience and discomfort because there is nothing to do about it john henrik clarke and i go off to search for a place to sleep having found an abandoned oldsmobile of about vintage and made our beds we return to the mess hall to find a riot in the making of all the delegations from a score of nations only one of them is creating a disturbance and it is to our shame the north americans the chief spokesman of the delegation is harold cruse and his two subalterns are very pale young white women all of whom are screaming at the harassed cuban aide assigned to us that they are starving to death and dying of thirst the profuse apologies of the poor aide whose command of english is practically nil are of no avail the fact that half a million people in these mountains are experiencing the same discomfiture has no impression on cruse and then i hear him the black nationalist cruse backed up by the two white women scream at the cuban youd damn well better get us something to eat and drink or ill go back to the states and write the worst things i can think of about you and your damned revolution i wrote down these words of cruse before i went to sleep that night and before reporting them here i have checked them against the recollection of others who were there the man who screamed that blackmail threat merely for food and water is the author of the crisis of the negro intellectual the political pundit who presumes to sit in moral judgment on almost every black person who has written and published a book a play or a poem i often disagreed with my friend lorraine hansberry and i still have differences with the american communist party which may one day be reconciled but there is one thing for which i shall never forgive either of them and that is that on the two occasions i have mentioned they did not help to produce harold cruses plays if they had he too might have become rich and famous that is he might have got his ration of food and water and we might have been spared this spiteful book james weldon johnson who was poet diplomat and j y civil_rights leader was also mentor to many young writers of the literary renaissance of harlem one of his friends was claude mckay a young jamaican poet of promise whom johnson met in mckay like some other artists of that era went into exile abroad it was while mckay was working with max eastman as an associate editor and drama critic for the liberator that he had the unpardonable experience that no doubt climaxed his growing disenchantment with america he and an artist friend attended a new york play opening as part of the invited guests and the press corps the usher who was supported by the manager refused to seat mckay in the press box although not a member of the communist party but certainly interested in communism and the recent russian revolution of mckay decided to go to russia it was james weldon johnson who helped him make financial arrangements for the trip that took him to various parts of europe and eventually to morocco johnson gave a gala farewell party at his harlem residence for mckay and guests included many of the black literary personages of that era mckay describes his colorful experiences abroad in his autobiography a long way from home in a chapter entitled hail and farewell to morocco he brings the reader up to that phase of his life when he decides to return to the united states it is interesting to note that mckay gives very little information about his decision to reum especially since his citizenship was periled there is evidence that it was johnson who played a major role in persuading mckay to return to harlem johnson wrote in a letter to max eastman that mckay does seem to be anxious to come back to the united states we know that johnson even went to washington d c to speak to officials at the department of state concerning mckays return in the same letter to eastman johnson stated that he had secured a copy of home to harlem and sent it to the assistant secretary of state with whom i had the conference regarding claude i sent it backing up my statements to him regarding claudes literary status the following three documents are interesting sidelights in that they answer some questions about claude mckay the proletarian poetnovelist and james weldon johnson the creative and genteel black american both men lived in an era of great social upheavals that are now significant historical events january my dear mr mckay i have just written a little biographical sketch of you for harper and brothers for bringing out your book they are going to send me a copy as soon as the book is off the press i am very anxious to see it and i hope it is going to have quite a sale i have been wanting to write you for some time i should like very much if you were back in the states in fact right in new york you ought to be here to take full advantage of the great wave of opportunity that negro literary and other artists are enjoying in additionwe need you to give more strength and solidity to the whole movement i wish you would think about coming back and if i can in any way be of any assistance whatever please do not hesitate to call on me with kindest regards i am his nigger was never supposed to learn how to write but he did and eldridge cleaver in the infancy of his new groove is already performing dearly needed surgery on this sickest of nations with his higher uneducation brother eldridge in soul on ice mcgrawhill cuts through all the nooks and crannies where hide the desperate secrets of the american madness to the essay cleaver brings scholarship passion and a freewheeling turnyouon style and not even the polemist hunters can deny the literary achievement in his works leroi jones reminded an audience of the way white gym teachers used to tell black youngsters to quit dribbling and shooting the basketball so fancy imploring them to do it natural but that was natural for you you know said jones likewise with cleavers prose we should know by now that eldridge cleaver was for some years a prisoner having been busted for getting caught with a shopping bag full of love in this land where youre only supposed to get high the way the crooks get high and for being a rapist cleaver just as certainly as he knows the one was not a crime knows that the other was and in his writing explores that experience including his motivations concluding that he had gone astray not so much from the white mans law as from being human civilized even the smallest insight into america reveals her extraordinary absence of depth blindness where there ought to be vision tradition where the need is imagination and the form of delusion that assumes longevity to be experience cleaver the fortunate victim of circumstances that forced him to get to himself in the process peeped the card of the populace this surgeon is not content to carelessly bandage the little cuts that irritate us into a more awesome fascism but instead takes his knife and cuts all the way to the ass where everybody says the pain is and brings to the surface even the secret secrets one has no choice but to witness his terrifying depth blowing away the puritan left in thee and rejoice for having discovered this youthful trailblazer who is as fresh as the next young girl who smiles your way and as wise as the school board decided we would never be they will accuse indeed they already have brother eldridge of being hungup on sexof course not once realizing that they have accused him of being hungup on lifewhich is only the logical course for those who so skillfully created a god that disdains the act of love reading cleaver and the murder of jesus christ by wilhelm reich at the same time it is impossible to believe that the two did not communicate for they both the essayist and the psychiatrist the black man and the white man shared that liberating knowledge of the connection between mans and womans inability to function as whole sexual units and their helpless succumbing to the fatal mandate of the warlords cleaver could have as easily quoted reich as norman mailer in his assertion that the upper classes exchange sex for power in his brilliant essay the primeval mitosis cleaver scientifically examines that which underlies the white man s having rendered himself sexless and given to the black man all such powerswhich of course makes the destruction of that power ie black man essential to his own frank james jesse james l b james supremacy of the universe cleaver believes as poetsociologist calvin hernton opined at a new york conference a few years back that a good piece would go a long long way to more good pieces perhaps notes on a native son is without question one of the more important critical looks at james baldwin however much it might affront the sensibility of the baldwin lovers and it does at first struck by baldwins power at combining the alphabet with the volatile elements of his soul cleaver allows that he was among we brothers who lusted for everything that came out of baldwins mind but suddenly he finds himself appalled by what he calls baldwins shameful fanatical fawning sycophantic love of the whites he speaks with more sensitivity than did sylvester leaks a few years ago of baldwins hatred for blacks which was of course rather obvious in his earliest writingsalthough neither cleaver nor this reviewer recognized it as such at first because and sometimes cleaver seems to avoid this horrible truth our love for black people was still rather dubiousand gradually gets to what really outrages him baldwins quarrels with norman mailer and richard wright and baldwins homosexuality while one accepts that the homosexual is offcenter which is perhaps taking a gutless position one must tell an otherwise perceptive cleaver to go straight to hell with that crap that would equate baldwin with the white mans most valuable tool in oppressing other blacks believing that men do not simply become homosexuals any more than they simply become prisoners one is quick to wonder if perhaps the power in baldwin which cleaver honors is as much the product of his experiences as is eldridges own one grows tired of being reminded that baldwin hated black people because they failed to produce rembrandt because one thinks that that favorite cliche of his critics has lost validity except as an historical reference do we really believe that baldwin because of our image of him has not grown and are we convinced he has grown less than those of us who indulge in the kind of emptiness that rewards us with a womandespising manhood some of us hate ourselves because we cannot find a meaningful relationship with a woman and because we are addicted to heterosexuality are doomed to the familiar wandering and frustration we get plentyof what cleaver talks about baldwins contradictions and giving reason to believe that he understands the value of meaningful relationships between man and woman it seems rather a contradiction that he could dismiss baldwins essay on andre gide with out confessing that it was instructive for him in terms of his own manhood cleaver on baldwin is penetrating consuming and not without the ambiguity one comes upon in the best of art but it leaves you feeling that he saved his most vicious screams for the man he really loves as indeed he should which says something else about eldridge cleaver something beautiful and one can only hope to someday read baldwin on cleaver eldridge the ofay watcher is another gas ofay watchers anonymous we might be called because we exist concealed in the shadows wherever colored people have known oppression by whites he writes before putting together a compact but full treatise on the crimes of the american white man and the lifestyle grown out of those crimes black nationalist cleaver ironically brings seldom observed insight into the dilemma of the young whites who would be caught up in the web of blueeyed lies that is their inheritance and in spite of his militant friends who dont yet understand that what made the beast a beast can make others beasts which has nothing to do really with reverse racism that jive term cleaver is courageous enough to not save for an easier time his understanding that all that black those young folk are getting next to will also blow blue eyes out of this patch in the pasture which reminds me that one afternoon in a tv studio i watched brother cleaver take notes and found it hard to believe he was the same cat whose writings had turned me not just on but loose there was something going on in his head that i naturally then could not see but we should all see and eldridge knows it and he would help us what more can you say about a brothers work david llorens rannie toomers little baby boy snooks was dying from double pneumonia and whooping cough she sat away from him looking into the low fire her long crusty bottom lip hanging she was not married was not pretty was not anybody much and he was all she had lawd why dont that doctor come on here she moaned into the fire tears sliding out of her sticky eyes she had not washed since snooks took sick five days ago and a long row of whitish snail tracks laced her ashen face what you ought to try is some of the old home remedies sarah urged she was an old neighbor lady who wore magic leaves round her neck sewed up in possum skin next to a dried lizards foot she knew how magic came about and could do magic herself people said we going to have us a doctor rannie toomer walked over and shooed a fat winter fly from her childs forehead i dont believe in none of that swamp magic she said all the old home remedies i took when i was a child just come short of killing me snooks under a pile of faded quilts made a small gravelike mound in the bed his head was like a ball of black putty wedged between the thin covers and the dingy yellow pillow his little eyes were partly open as if he were peeping out of his hard wasted skull at the chilly room and the forceful pulse of his breathing caused a faint rustling in the sheets near his mouth like the wind pushing damp papers in a shallow ditch what time you reckon that white doctorll git here asked sarah emphasizing the doctors color and trying to catch the childs breathing above the wind outside not expecting rannie toomer to answer her she sat with her old knees wide apart under many apron tails and long dark skirts heavy with stains from time to time she reached long cracked fingers down to sweep her damp skirts away from the live coals it was almost spring but the winter cold still clung to her bones and she had to almost sit in the fireplace to be warm her deep sharp eyes set in the rough leather of her face had aged a moist hesitant blue that gave her a quick dull stare like a hawk if she had ever lost faith in magic nobody knew about it for nobody could remember old sarah without her roots and dead cats she just appeared suddenly when something strong was needed the greatest piece of magic in itself some said that they had ever seen now she gazed coolly at rannie toomer and rapped the hearth stones with her stick white mailman white doctor she chanted darkly under her breath as if to banish spirits they gotta come see bout this baby rannie toomer said wistfully whod go and ignore a little sick baby like my snooks she asked some folks we dont know so well as we thinks we do might the old lady replied what you want to give that boy of yours is one or two of the old home remedies arrowsroot or sassyfrass and cloves or a sugar tit soaked in cats blood rannie toomers face went tight we dont need none of your witchs remedies she cried grasping her baby by his shrouded toes trying to knead life into him like she kneaded limberness into flour dough we going to git some of them shots that makes peoples well curesem of all they ails cleansem out and makesem strong all at the same time she spoke upward from her sons feet as if he were an altar doctorll be here soon baby she whispered to him then rose to look out the grimy window i done sent the mailman she rubbed her face against the glass her flat nose more flattened as she peered out into the rain rannie toomer had gone down to the mailbox in the rain that morning hoping she hadnt missed the mailmans car she had watched from across the pasture since seven although she knew it wouldnt be along until a few minutes after ten like it always was she sat down on an old milk can that had been abandoned near the mailbox and turned her drooping face in the direction the mailmans car would come she had no umbrella and her coat was as thin and as short as a denim blouse her feet shivered inside thin clear plastic shoes that let in water and mud finally she saw him coming howde rannie mae the redfaced mailman said pleasantly as he always did when she stood by the car waiting to ask him something usually she wanted to ask what certain circulars meant that showed pretty pictures of things she needed did the circulars mean that somebody was coming around later and give her hats and suitcases and shoes and sweaters and rubbing alcohol and a heater for the house and a fur bonnet for her baby or why did he always give her the pictures if she couldnt have what was in them or what did the words say especially the big word written in red sale he would explain shortly to her that the only way she could get the goods pictured on the circulars was to buy them in town and that town stores did their advertising by sending out pictures of their goods she would listen with her mouth hanging open until he finished then she would exclaim in a dull amazed way that she never had any money and he could ask anybody she couldnt ever buy any of the things in the picturesso why did the stores keep sending them to her he tried to explain to her that everybody got the circulars whether they had any money to buy with or not that this was one of the laws of advertising and he could not do anything about it he was sure she never understood what he tried to teach her about advertising for one day she asked him for any extra circulars he had and when he asked her what she wanted them forsince she couldnt afford to buy any of the items advertised she said she needed them to paper the inside of her house to keep out the wind today he thought she looked more ignorant than usual as she stuck her dripping head inside his car waiting for him to take away her dumbness and stupidity he recoiled from her breath before it reached him and gave little attention to what she was saying about her sick baby as he mopped up the water she dripped on the plastic door handle of the car well never can keepem dry i mean warm enough in rainy weather like this here he mumbled absently stuffing a wad of circulars advertising hairdryers and cold creams into her hands he wished she would stand back from his car so he could get going but she clung to the side gabbing away about snooks and newmonia and shots and how she wanted a real doctor to everything she said he nodded that right he injected sympathetically from time to time and from time to time he sneezed for she was letting in wetness and damp and he felt he was coming down with a cold black people as black as rannie toomer always made him uneasy especially when they didnt smell good and when you could tell they didnt right away rannie mae leaning in over him out of the rain smelled like a wet goat her dark dirty eyes clinging to his face with such hungry desperation made him nervous why did colored folks always want you to do something for them one of the reasons he had not wanted to take this job as rural mailman was because he would have to talk to colored people who never seemed to understand that it wasnt the mailmans duty to fetch doctors and deliver babies and set splints and take care of any other mizries they might have now he cleared his throat and made a motion as if to roll up his window well ah mighty sorry to hear bout that little fella he said groping for the window crank well see what we can do he gave her what he hoped was a big friendly smile god he didnt want to hurt her feelings she looked so pitiful hanging there in the rain suddenly he had an idea whynt you try some of old aunt sarahs home remedies he suggested brightly still smiling he halfbelieved with everybody else in the county that the old blueeyed black woman possessed magic magic that if it didnt work on whites probably would on blacks but rannie toomer almost turned the car over shaking her head and body with an emphatic no she reached in a wet crusted hand to grasp his shoulder we wants us a doctor a real doctor she screamed she had begun to cry and drop her tears on him you git us a doctor from town she bellowed shaking the solid shoulder that bulged under his warm coat like i say he drawled lamely although beginning to be furious with her well do what we can and he hurriedly rolled up the window and sped down the road cringing from the thought that she had put her nasty black hands on him old home remediesold home remedies rannie toomer had cursed the words while she licked at the hot tears that ran down her face the only warmth about her she turned backwards to the trail that led to her house trampling the wet circulars under her feet under the fence she went and was in a pasture surrounded by dozens of fat whitefolks cows and an old gray horse and a mule or two animals lived there in the pasture all around her house and she and snooks lived in it old sarah dug steadily at the fire the bones in her legs ached like they were sitting through a windy day outside the flesh that encased them white mailman white doctor white doctor white mailman she chanted from time to time putting the poker down carefully and rubbing her shins the young ones will turn to them she said when it is us olduns what got the power whynt you git away from that draff there by the winder she asked rannie toomer she had put together something hot in a dish and was drinking it from between cupped palms making her hands warm you going to catch your death of cold standing there looking for that white doctor that aint coming nohow he is coming too rannie toomer said angrily she wondered why she had bothered to let in the old woman when she came hobbling across the pasture to her m a a m a a a a door it was less than an hour after she had talked to the mailman that she looked up expecting the doctor and saw old sarah tramping through the grass on her walking stick she couldnt pretend she wasnt home with the smoke climbing out the chimney so she let her in making her leave her bag of tricks on the front porch old woman old as that ought to forgit trying to cure other people with her nigger magic ought to use some of it on herself she thought rannie would not let her lay a finger on snooks and warned the old woman if she tried anything she would knock her over the head with her own cane he coming alright rannie toomer said firmly looking straining her eyes to see through the rain let me tell you child the old woman said almost gently sipping from her dish he aint rannie toomer had not let her near the boy on the bed since she came in and that had made her angry but now she looked at the calloused bare heels of the young woman and smiled sadly marking the rejection of herself and the often queer fact that the young always grow up hoping when would this one know she mused that she could only depend on those who would come she thought the time was near across the room she had begun to pace but i told you rannie toomer said in exasperation i asked the mailman to bring a doctor for my snooks cold wind was shooting all around her from the cracks in the window framing faded circulars blew inward from the walls the old womans gloomy prediction made her tremble he done fetched the doctor the old woman said rubbing her dish with her hand what you reckon brung me over here in this here floodwont no desire to see no rainbows i can tell you rannie toomer paled s the doctor child the old woman turned to rannie with dull wise eyes that there white mailman didnt get no further with that message of yours then the road in front of my house lucky he got good lungsdeef as i is i had myself a time trying to make out what he was yelling rannie began to cry moaning suddenly the breathing of snooks from the bed seemed to drown out the noise of the downpour outside rannie toomer could feel his pulse making the whole house shake here she cried snatching up the baby and handing him to the old woman make him well o my lawd make him well old sarah rose from her seat by the fire and took the tiny baby already turning a purplish blue around the eyes and mouth lets not upset this little fella unnecessarylike she said placing the baby back on the bed gently she began to examine him all the while moaning and humming some thin pagan tune that pushed against the sound of the wind and rain with its own melancholy power she stripped him of all his clothes poked at his fibreless baby ribs blew against his chest along his flat tiny back she ran her soft old fingers the child hung on in deep rasping sleep and his small glazed eyes neither opened fully nor fully closed rannie toomer swayed trancelike over the bed watching the old woman touching the baby she thought of the time she had wasted waidng for the real doctor her feeling of guilt was a stone ill do anything you say do aunt sarah she cried mopping at her nose with her dress anything you sayjust please god make him git better old sarah dressed the baby again and sat down in front of the fire she stayed deep in thought for several minutes rannie toomer gazed first into her silent face and then at the baby whose breathing seemed to have eased since sarah picked him up do something quick she urged sarah in her mind wanting to believe in her powers completely do something thatll make him rise up and call his mama the childs dying said the old woman bluntly staking out beforehand some limitation to her skill her powers were mostly those of a feeling heart availability and a desire to help that was the magic she had beyond the real doctor but she went on there might be something still we might do what aunt sarah what rannie toomer was on her knees before the old womans chair wringing her hands and crying she had never been more frightened in her life she fastened hungry eyes on sarahs lips how could she have thought the white doctor could help her snooks she had to believe totally in the powers of the old woman all she could see for saving her snooks was hidden in the deep brooding eyes of the withered old magician before her what can i do she urged fiercely hearing the faint labored breathing from the bed it going to take a strong stomach said old sarah slowly it going to take a mighty strong stomach and most you young peoples these days dont haveem snooks got a strong stomach rannie toomer cried looking anxiously into the serious old face it aint him thats got to have the strong stomach she said glancing down at the sobbing girl at her feet tom the one got to have the strong stomach he wont know what it is hes drinking she turned her hooded blue eyes towards the bed rannie toomer began to tremble way down deep in her stomach it sure was weak she thought trembling like that but what could she mean her snooks to drink not cats blood and not some of the messes with chicken droppings shed heard sarah mixed up for people sick with colic what did she mean what is it she whispered bringing her head close to the firm sure knee sarah leaned over and put her toothless mouth to her ear the only thing that can save this child now is some good strong horse tea she kept her eyes on the girls face the only thing her face was grim and if you wants him out of that bed you better make tracks to git some rannie toomer took up her wet outdoors coat and stepped across the porch to the pasture the rain was falling against her face with the force of small hailstones she started walking in the direction of the trees where she could see bulky lightish shapes that looked like cows her thin plastic shoes were nearly sucked off in the mud but she pushed herself forward searching with her eyes for the lone gray mare the gray mare was under the trees with the cows all the animals shifted ground and rolled big dark eyes at rannie toomer she made as little noise as she could and leaned herself against a tree to wait thunder rose from the side of the sky like tires of a big truck rumbling over rough dirt road then it stood a split second in the middle of the sky before it exploded like a giant fire cracker then rolled away again like an empty keg lightning streaked across the sky setting the air white and charged rannie toomer stood dripping under her tree hoping not to be struck she kept her eyes carefully on the behind of the gray mare and after nearly an hour had passed the old horse began nonchalantly to spread her muddy knees at that moment rannie toomer realized that in her grief and upset she had brought nothing to catch the precious tea in lightning struck something not far off and caused a cracking and groaning from the sky and woods that frightened the animals into running away from their shelter rannie toomer slipped down in the mud trying to take off one of her plastic shoes to catch the tea and the gray mare trickling some made a break for another spot of shelter along with the other animals rannie toomer was close enough to the gray mare to catch the tea if she could keep up with the mare while she ran so alternately holding her breath and gasping for air she started after her mud from her fall clung to her elbows and streaked her frizzy hair slipping and sliding in the mud she raced after the big mare holding out as if for alms her plastic shoe in the house the old woman sat with her shawls and sweaters tight around her rubbing her knees and muttering under her breath she heard the thunder felt the lightning that lit up the dingy room and turned her old wrinkled face to the bed hobbling over on stiff legs she could hear no sound the frail breathing had stopped with the thunder not to come again across the mudwashed pasture rannie toomer stumbled holding out her plastic shoe for the gray mare to fill in spurts and splashes mixed with rainwater she gathered her tea in parting the old mare snorted and threw up one big leg knocking rannie toomer back into the mud but she rose trembling and crying holding the shoe spilling none over the top but realizing a leak a tiny crack at her shoes front quickly she stuck her mouth there over the crack and ankle deep in the slippery mud of the pasture and freezing in her shabby wet coat she ran home to give the still warm strong horse tea to her baby snooks hold still judy mrs h simmons said around the spray of pins that protruded dangerously from her mouth she gave the thirtieth tug to the tight sash at the waist of the dress now walk over there and turn around slowly the dress judys first long one was white organdy over taffeta with spaghetti straps that bared her round brown shoulders and a floating skirt and a wide sash that cascaded in a butterfly effect behind it was a dream but judy was sick and tired of the endless fittings she had endured so that she might wear it at the debutantes ball her thoughts leaped ahead to the ball itself slowly i said mrs simmons dark angular face was always grim but now it was screwed into an expression resembling a prune judy starting nervously began to revolve by moving her feet an inch at a time her mother watched her critically no its still not right ill just have to rip out that waistline seam again oh mother judys impatience slipped out at last nobodys going to notice all those little details they will too theyll be watching you every minute hoping to see something wrong youve got to be the best cant you get that through your head mrs simmons gave a sigh of despair you better start noticin all those little details yourself i cant do it for you all your life now turn around and stand up straight oh mother judy said close to tears from being made to turn and pose while her feet itched to be dancing i cant stand it any more you cant stand it huh how do you think i feel mrs simmons said in her harshest tone judy was immediately ashamed remembering the weeks her mother had spent at the sewing machine picking her already tattered fingers with needles and pins and the great weight of sacrifice that had been borne on mrs simmons shoulders for the past two years so that judy might bare hers at the ball all right take it off her mother said im going to take it up the street to mrs luby and let her help me its got to be right or i wont let you leave the house cant we just leave it the way it is mother judy pleaded without hope of success i think its perfect you would mrs simmons said tartly as she folded the dress and prepared to bear it out of the room sometimes i think ill never get it through your head you got to look just right and act just right that rose griffin and those other girls can afford to be careless maybe but you cant youre gonna be the darkest poorest one there judy shivered in her new lace strapless bra and her old childish knit snuggies you make it sound like a battle im going to instead of just a dance it is a battle her mother said firmly it starts tonight and it goes on for the rest of your life the battle to hold your head up and get someplace and be somebody weve done all we can for you your father and i now youve got to start fighting some on your own she gave judy a slight smile her voice softened a little youll do all right dont worry try and get some rest this afternoon just dont mess up your hair all right mother judy said listlessly she did not really think her father had much to do with anything that happened to her it was her mother who had ingratiated her way into the gay charmers two years ago taking all sorts of humiliation from the betterdressed betteroff lighterskinned women humbly making and mending their dresses fixing food for their meetings addressing more mail and selling more tickets than anyone else the club had put it off as long as they could but finally they had to admit mrs simmons to membership because she worked so hard and that meant of course that judy would be on the list for this years ball her father a quiet carpenter who had given up any other ambitions years ago did not think much of negro society or his wifes fierce determination to launch judy into it just keep clean and be decent he would say thats all anybody has to do her mother always answered if thats all did wed still be on relief and he would shut up with shame over the years when he had been laid off repeatedly and her days work and sewing had kept them going now he had steady work but she refused to quit as if she expected it to end at any moment the intense energy that burned in mrs simmons large dark eyes had scorched her features into permanent irony she worked day and night and spent her spare time scheming and planning whatever her personal ambitions had been judy knew she blamed mr simmons for their failure now all her schemes revolved around their only child judy went to her mothers window and watched her stride down the street with the dress until she was hidden by the high brick wall that went around two sides of their house then she returned to her own room she did not get dressed because she was afraid of pulling a sweater over her hairher mother would notice the difference even if it looked all right to judy and because she was afraid that doing anything even getting dressed might precipitate her into the battle she drew a stool up to her window and looked out she had no real view but she liked her room the wall hid the crowded tenement houses beyond the alley and from its cracks and bumps and depressions she could construct any imaginary landscape she chose it was how she had spent most of the free hours of her dreamy adolescence hey can i go it was the voice of an invisible boy in the alley as another boy chuckled judy recognized the familiar ritual if you said yes they said can i go with you it had been tried on her dozens of times she always walked past head in the air as if she had not heard her mother said that was the only thing to do if they knew she was a lady they wouldnt dare bother her but this time a girls voice cool and assured answered if you think you big enough it said it was lucy mae watkins judy could picture her standing there in a tight dress with bright brazen eyes im big enough to give you a baby the boy answered judy would die if a boy ever spoke to her like that but she knew lucy mae could handle it lucy mae could handle all the boys even if they ganged up on her because she had been born knowing something other girls had to learn aw you aint big enough to give me a shoeshine she told him come here and ill show you how big i am the boy said yeah lucy mae whats happenin another younger boy said come here and tell us lucy mae laughed what im puttin down is too strong for little boys like you come here a minute baby the first boy said i got a cigarette for you aw i aint studyin your cigarettes lucy mae answered but her voice was closer directly below judy there were the sounds of a scuffle and lucy maes muffled laughter when she spoke her voice sounded raw and cross come on now boy cut it out and give me the damn cigarette there was more scuffling and the sharp crack of a slap and then lucy mae said cut it out i said just for that im gonna take em all the clack of high heels rang down the sidewalk with a boys clumsy shoes in pursuit judy realized that there were three of them down there let her go buster one said you cant catch her now aw hell man she took the whole damn pack the one called buster complained thatll learn you lucy maes voice mocked from down the street dont mess with nothin you cant handle hey lucy mae hey i heard rudy grant already gave you a baby a second boy called out yeah is that true lucy mae the youngest one yelled there was no answer she must be a block away by now for a moment the hidden boys were silent then one of them guffawed directly below judy and the other two joined in the secret male laughter that was oddly highpitched and feminine aw man i dont know what you all laughin about buster finally grumbled that girl took all my cigarettes you got some leroy naw the second boy said me neither the third one said what we gonna do i aint got but fifteen cent hell man i want more than a feel for a pack of cigarettes there was an unpleasant whine in busters voice hell for a pack of cigarettes i want a bitch to come across she will next time man the boy called leroy said she better buster said you know she better if she pass by here again we gonna jump her you hear sure man leroy said the three of us can grab her easy then we can all three of us have some fun oh yeah man the youngest boy said he sounded as if he might be about leroy said we oughta get roland and j t too for a whole pack of cigarettes she oughta treat all five of us aw man why tell roland and j t the youngest voice whined they aint in it them was our cigarettes they was my cigarettes you mean buster said with authority you guys better quit it before i decide to cut you out oh man dont do that we with you you know that sure buster we your aces man all right thats better there was a minute of silence then what we gonna do with the girl buster the youngest one wanted to know when she come back we gonna jump the bitch man we gonna jump her and grab her then we gonna turn her every way but loose he went on spinning a crude fantasy that got wilder each time he retold it until it became so secretive that their voices dropped to a low indistinct murmur punc tuated by guffaws now and then judy could distinguish the word girl or the other word they used for it these words always produced the loudest guffaws of all she shook off her fear with the thought that lucy mae was too smart to pass there again today she had heard them at their dirty talk in the alley before and had always been successful in ignoring it it had nothing to do with her the wall protected her from their kind all the ugliness was on their side of it and this side was hers to fill with beauty she turned on her radio to shut them out completely and began to weave her tapestry to its music more for practice than anything else she started by picturing the maps of the places to which she intended to travel then went on to the faces of her friends rose griffins sharp indian profile appeared on the wall her coloring was like an indians too and her hair was straight and black and glossy judys hair naturally none of these things had been done four days ago so that tonight it would be old enough to have a gloss as naturallooking as roses but rose despite her handsome looks was silly her voice broke constantly into highpitched giggles and she became even sillier and more nervous around boys judy was not sure that she knew how to act around boys either the sisters kept boys and girls apart at the catholic high school where her parents sent her to keep her away from lowclass kids but she felt that she knew a secret tonight in that dress with her hair in a sophisticated upsweep she would be transformed into a poised princess tonight all the college boys her mother described so eagerly would rush to dance with her and then from somewhere the boy would appear she did not know his name she neither knew nor cared whether he went to college but she imagined that he would be as dark as she was and that there would be awe and diffidence in his manner as he bent to kiss her hand a waltz swelled from the radio the wall turning blue in deepening twilight came alive with whirling figures judy rose and began to go through the steps she had rehearsed for so many weeks she swirled with a practiced smile on her face holding an imaginary skirt at her side turned dipped and flicked on her bedside lamp without missing a fraction of the beat faster and faster she danced with her imaginary partner to an inner music that was better than the sounds on the radio she was coming out and tonight the world would discover what it had been waiting for all these years aw git it baby she ignored it as she would ignore the crowds that lined the streets to watch her pass on her way to the ball aw do your number she waltzed on safe and secure on her side of the wallcan i come up there and do it with you at this she stopped paralyzed somehow they had come over the wall or around it and into her room man i sure like the view from here the youngest boy said how come we never tried this view before she came to life ran quickly to the lamp and turned it off but not before buster said yeah and the back view is fine too aw she turned off the light a voice complained put it on again baby we dont mean no harm let us see you dance some more i bet you can really do it yeah i bet she can shimmy on down you know it man come on down here baby busters voice urged softly dangerously i got a cigarette for you yeah and he got something else for you too judy flattened against her closet door gradually lost her urge to scream she realized that she was shivering in her underwear taking a deep breath she opened the closet door and found her robe she thought of going to the window and yelling down you dont have a thing i want do you understand but she had more important things to do wrapping her hair in protective plastic she ran a full steaming tub and dumped in half a bottle of her mothers favorite cologne at first she scrubbed herself furiously irritating her skin but finally she stopped knowing she would never be able to get cleaner than this again she could not wash away the thing they considered dirty the thing that made them pronounce girl in the same way as the other fourletter words they wrote on the wall in the alley it was part of her just as it was part of her mother and rose griffin and lucy mae she relaxed then because it was true that the boys in the alley did not have a thing she wanted she had what they wanted and the knowledge replaced her shame with a strange calm feeling of power after her bath she splashed on more cologne and spent minutes on her makeup erasing and retracing her eyebrows six times until she was satisfied she went to her mothers room then and found the dress finished and freshly pressed on its hanger when mrs simmons came upstairs to help her daughter she found her sitting on the bench before the vanity mirror as if it were a throne she looked young and arrogant and beautiful and perfect and cold why youre dressed already mrs simmons said in surprise while she stared judy rose with perfect icy grace and glided to the center of the room she stood there motionless as a mannequin i want you to fix the hem mother she directed its still uneven in back her mother went down obediently on her knees muttering it looks all right to me she put in a couple of pins that better yes judy said with a brief glance at the mirror youll have to sew it on me mother i cant take it off now id ruin my hair mrs simmons went to fetch her sewing things returned and surveyed her daughter you sure did a good job on yourself i must say she admitted grudgingly cant find a thing to complain about youll look as good as anybody there of course mother judy said as mrs simmons knelt and sewed i dont know what you were so worried about her secret feeling of confidence had returned stronger than ever but the evening ahead was no longer the vague girlish fantasy she had pictured on the wall it had hard clear outlines leading up to a definite goal she would be the belle of the ball because she knew more than rose griffin and her silly friends more than her mother more even than lucy mae because she knew better than to settle for a mere pack of cigarettes there her mother said breaking the thread she got up i never expected to get you ready this early ernest lee wont be here for another hour that silly ernest lee judy said with a new contempt in her young voice until tonight she had been pleased by the thought of going to the dance with ernest lee he was nice she felt comfortable with him and he might even be the awestruck boy of her dream he was a dark serious neighborhood boy who could not afford to go to college mrs simmons had reluctantly selected him to take judy to the dance because all the gay charmers sons were spoken for now with an undertone of excitement judy said im going to ditch him after the first dance mother youll see im going to come home with one of the college boys its very nice ernest lee she told him an hour later when he handed her the white orchid but its rather small im going to wear it on my wrist if you dont mind and then dazzling him with a smile of sweetest cruelty she stepped back and waited while he fumbled with the door you know edward im not worried about her any more mrs simmons said to her husband after the children were gone her voice became harsh and grating put down that paper and listen to me arent you interested in your child thats better she said as he complied meekly i was saying i do believe shes learned what ive been trying to teach her after all the whole damn t thing is berthas fault bertha is my roommate and a very black person to put it mildly shes a revolutionary i dont want to spend needless time discussing bertha but its sort of important before i met her i was ayn randbarry goldwater all the way bertha kept asking how could black people be conservative what have they got to conserve and after a while realizing that i had absolutely nothing period i came around but not as fast as she was moving it wasnt enough that i learned to like the regular mass of colored peopleas a whole as it werebut she wanted me to like the individual colored people that we knew i resisted that like hell but eventually came around bertha is the sort of person where eventually you come around now just be patient you want to know why im late dont you so i got an afro and began the conference beat and did all those black things that we were supposed to do i even gave up white men for the movement and that was no easy sacrifice not that they were that good nobody come down with a sister like a brotherbut they were a major source of support for me i agreed that they shouldnt be allowed to support the movement but i believe in income being passed around and if anyone has income to spare whiteys do so i cut myself off from a very important love of mine money and that presented a problem no im not going round robinhoods barn this is a part of it so when my income was terminated for ideological reasons youd think shed say something like ill take over the rent and your gas bill since youve sacrificed so much for the movement youd really think that wouldnt you but no she asked me about a job a job for christs sake i didnt even know anybody who worked but her and here she was talking bout a job i calmly suggested that i would apply for relief you see i believe society owes all of its members certain things like food clothing shelter and gas so i was going to apply to society since individual contributions were no longer acceptable she laughed that cynical laugh of hers and offered to go down with me no says i i can do it myself so i went down at the end of the week now im a firm believer in impressions i think the first impression people make is very important and since i would have to consider welfare my job from now on for berthas sake at least i got dressed up and went down im sure youve applied for relief at least once so you know the procedure i went to intake and met an old civil servant the kind whose been on the job since hayes set the system up she asked me so many questions about my personal life i thought she was interviewing me for a possible spot in heaven then we got to my family i told her mommy was a supervisor in the welfare department and that daddy was a social worker she shook her head and looked disgustedjust plain disgusted with mehuffed up her flat chest and said young lady you are not eligible for relief and stormed away i started after her what the hell do you mean eligible i asked ill take somebodys job who really needs it somebody with skills or the ability to be trained with a wife and kids or maybe just an unwed mother will be put out of work what kind of jive agency are you you sure dont give a damn about people as she turned the corner i had to run to keep up with her and who are you to decide what i need you nothing but a jive petty bourgeoisie bullcrap civil servant yes i did i told her exactly that i mean thats what she is going round deciding peoples needs you got needs yourself who decides how your needs gonna be filled you aint god or mary or even the holy ghost telling me what im eligible for and i was laying her out the nerve id come all the way down there and didnt have on levis or my miniskirt but looked nice i mean really clean and she says im not eligible really did piss me off at the end of the corridor where she was hurrying to i saw this figure it looked real small and pitiful like it was mommy i guess someone had recognized me and called her to come down i went over to put my arms around her dont cry mommy itll be all right but she just cried and cried and kept saying oh kim why cant you be like other daughters i got so involved with soothing her that the servant got away mom i said as i walked her to her office theres going to be a black revolution all over the world and we must prepare for it weve got to determine our own standards of eligibility thats all she quit crying a little and just looked at me pitifully then she put her arms around me and said oh kim i love you but why cant you just get married and divorced and have babies and things like other daughters why do you have to disgrace us like this i didnt mind when you got kicked out of school for drinking and i even got used to all those men i didnt like and remember the time you made the front page for doing that gogo dance at the democratic convention ive been a democrat all my life you know that but i was proud that in the middle of johnsons speech you jumped on the table shoes and all to dance your protest to the war in vietnam but this is my job your father and i have worked very hard to give you everything we could mom i cut her off im not against your job i tried to explain it wasnt personal even when i had to throw that rock through her office window that time we didnt fire bomb did we no i told the group dont fire bomb the welfare department and when we had to turn the directors car over you noticed that he didnt get hurt i told the group be sure not to hurt the director thats what i told them but mom im broke now all my savings are gone and if i dont get on relief ill have to take a job oh mommy what will i do if i take a job locked up in a building with all those strangers for eight hours every day and people saying good morning kim hows it going or hey kim what you doing after work i mean getting familiar with me and i dont even know them how could i stand that then for the first time in the years ive known her she looked me dead in the eyei mean exactly straightand said youll either have to work or go to grad school it floored me i mean shes never made a decision like that all the time ive known her mom i said you dont mean it youve been talking to bertha youre angry with me for what i told that civil servant ill apologize ill make it up somehow i swear ill get my hair done but she would not budge kim its school or a job mom member when i went back and graduated from college magna cum laude and all member how proud you and daddy were that i had the guts to go back after all they did to me in college member what you said member how you said i had done all you wanted me to do member how you kept saying you wouldnt ask me for nothing else member mom mom member but she wouldnt budge i tell you its something when your own mother turns against you she knew i was working for revolution what would happen to the revolution if i quit to take a job what would my people do i asked her and she looked at me and said rather coldly if i recall your people need you to lead the way not just toward irresponsible acts but toward a true revolution theres nothing irresponsible about chaos and anarchy we must brush our teeth before eating a meal kim ive read everything you have written ive heard on tape all your speeches and what are you talking about now program ive read frantz fanon and stokely carmichael i especially enjoyed burn the honky by h rap brown hes got an amazing sense of humor ive read killens and jones and neal and mckissick ive read most of the books on those lists you gave us havent i always tried to understand you and sympathize with you when i was going to get mother a cook book did i buy la gastronomiquel no i bought the ebony cook book even though mother has forgotten more than freda deknight could ever have known when your father and i went to the social work convention in detroit last year did we stay with the other delegates at the hilton no we stayed at the rio grande ive done all i could for the revolution and ill probably do more but im not going to allow you this behavior you will get a job or you will go to school aw mom i protested you just dont understand kim thats all there is to it ill give you a surprise when you tell me something definite i was crushed absolutely crushed my own mother turned against me i must have looked terribly hurt because she kissed me again and said oh kim its best really it is if i can read your people and try to understand your way you can try mine i called my father i asked him to take me to lunch i think he knew he didnt know when i called him but by the time we met for lunchhe knew course being a social worker and relating to people and all for a living he didnt just burst in and say i agree with your mother no he sat down and ordered me a drink he doesnt drink anymore since he and his liver made an intellectual decision that negroes shouldnt get high this is his sacrifice for the movement of course he quit five years ago when he was in the hospital he considered it a religious conversion thing his own special sacrifice to jesus we used to ask about it but he always just said jesus had spoken to him through his liver and nothing would shake him he quit church after a couple of months but he continued to tithe every month faithfully and never drank again his tennis game improved and he got to be a good swimmer again he took up golf and to tell the truth had gotten so damned cleancutamerican that mommy began sneaking gin into his eggs every morning just to keep him from becoming a real bastard he doesnt know that however so we sat down and i had a drink and we ordered lunch whats on your mind chicken he always calls me some sort of animal or inanimate object im not sure what his message is i didnt want to throw it on him right away daddymonmysaysivegottogotoschoolortakeajobandidontthinkthatsfair i said uhmm would you say that again in english i mean american mommy says i have to go to school or get a job good lambiepie which one is it daddy you dont understand i dont think its fair of course not sugar lump she shouldnt have said it like that you just get yourself a nice job you dont even have to consider school ill call up harry white and see what he can do for you course you can get one on your own you just let me know what you would like oh daddy i said youre on her side and shes been talking to bertha and nobody even understands me i try to understand you angel cake ive read almost all those books on your lists and everything youve written and ive heard all your speeches i think youre doing fine work but you must set an example too you just show your people that new systems can be created if you want to destroy something you must first learn how it works and what need its filling after thehow you say black flameencases the world youll want your people to work for the black nation how can you encourage that if you have no idea what youre asking of them thats one thing i noticed about everyone from nkrumah to ben bella to brown they dont really know what theyre asking everydaypeople to do not that they dont work and hardbut do they punch a time clock do they have a minute lunch break do they dig ditches work in a mine not that they have to do everyone of those but have they labored have they punched a time clock its important that they do and all the readand writing in the world doesnt give a true understanding of time clocks maybe theyll do away with time clocks but they must first understand what purpose they serve before they do oh daddy not that many black folks ever punch a clock im not talking just about a clock and you know it im talking about going to work on time eating lunch on time getting off on time going home on time all those meetings conferences and rallieseven if they are on time are scheduled to your and their conveniencenot the peoples get up at or go downtown eat lunch with a couple of thousand people relate to your supervisor relate to your clients relate to the people in your office or sewer get off at or rush home read your paper while your wife cooks dinner talk to your children listen to their troubles put them to bed talk to your wife listen to her troubles take her to bed and in your spare time watch tv say hello to your neighbor run to the store go to a rally try to read a book try that and you might understand why the revolution as you call it moves so slowly oh daddy i didnt want a lecture i just wanted you to be on my side is that my name now ohdaddy i am on your side brown sugar thats why im telling you this get yourself a job then do all the things youre doing you may readjust your methods i wont change i wont let the bourgeoisie system get me i didnt say your thinking kim i didnt say you would readjust your thinking i said you may change your methods lunch was ruined for me i went home to type a resume and that wasnt easy it had been that kind of a day i have this really neato pink ibmit was a gift though when i got it it was a downpayment its always worked right ive had it for twoandahalf years and never had a bit of trouble once a year i call the people and they clean and service itthats it its a dream but that day of all days it just wouldnt work right the s was skipping and the a was hitting twice plus the magic margin wouldnt click in and it was just a f y day i quit and stretched out on the floor i fell sort of half asleep i couldnt decide between school or an agency job and it must have been on my mind cause i had this really terrible dream there was this university chasing me down the streets i turned the corner to get away from it and ran right into the mouth of an agency it gobbled me up but it couldnt digest me when it tried to swallow me i put up such a fight that it belched me back into life as i hit the street there was this university again waiting for me like a big dyke that has run her prey into a corner with a greasy smile on her lips i woke up screaming both of them would destroy me and furthermore what did i need with a masters degree as i brooded on my future the image of educational institutions kept coming back going to school is like throwing the rabbit into a briar patch there would be scores of students that i could convert and because of academic freedom the school would have to accept and support me or at least leave me alone unless i flunked out drank a lot or smoked in public and if i applied in social work both mommy and daddy would be pleased cause id get a degree and agency training and an inadequate paycheck to boot so i sat down at my pink ibm to type a letter for an application blank surprisingly enough the typewriter was fixed i mailed it immediately and sat back while others stronger and wiser than i determined my fate geeze youve got a one track mind im trying to get around to explaining about the delay i was you know accepted in school i thought everyone would be happy and leave me alone that was february and i had nine months of freedom before enrollment day and i fully intended to use them i got my acceptance letter on a tuesday that was so upsetting that all i could do for a long time was just gnash and growl it didnt bother bertha a bit cause she just started running round the house singing kims going to school you know like she was happy my mood wasnt too positive so i told her dead calmly that if she didnt get the heck out of my half of the apartment id kill her she laughed one of those grand ha ha ha type things then spread her arms and pirouetted out the door it was hard to take after these years of free dom of choice and movement i was going back to school i just cried and cried then i thought what the hell hadnt i survived the time we were playing the prince of wales hadnt i survived the wisconsin sleeper hadnt i been to harlem hadnt i refused to lay a white boy when we were in mississippi on the big march why wouldnt i survive now i was really talking it up to myself much worse things had happened to me and here i was acting like a cry baby why wouldnt i survive i asked myself bravely boldly perhapsbrazenly why would i not survive because came the answer and i just cried and cried ive got to tell you this no dont be that waylisten if ever something happens to you that makes you real unhappy and youve just got to cry about it dont cry in the same spot move around thats what i learned after i cried and cried there was this shiny puddle around my feet and there were these bloodred eyes looking up at me i learned then never cry in one spot but i was cool with it i never really became emotionally involved in it i cleaned up the mess took a shower got dressed to a t then went out walking the streets i stopped by this bar i know and had a drink one of my brothers soul brothers bought me a drink and we started discussing what would have to come down he and i got into a real deep thing and we talked until the bar closed he kept wanting to kill toms and i still think thats not who we have to kill toms i told him only have power if we let them have power i mean if a tom says get off the streets and you get off the streets then thats your fault not his if on the other hand a tom tells you to get off the streets and you dont well then the power structure has no use for himplus if you can encourage him in a physical way to come on over to your side youve made a friend i mean you can beat anyone or boycott them or something besides killing a brother to get him to either help you or get out of the way there are too few brothers on this shore already to be killing each other off we need to get rid of whitey i mean if we cant kill a whitey how can we ever justify killing a brother thats a hell of a copout to me talking bout killing brothersand sisters tooand not being able to kill a whitey the only way we can ever justify offing a brother is if we have already offed whiteysthats the ratio i told him for offing a brother so we went to his place to talk farther the next morning all my problems were solved i thought i had figured it all out now this much i knew about social work school they will put up with anything at all except heterosexual relations i mean anything at all and the school where i was accepted was founded by two ladies who had adopted children i just knew if i wrote them and explained that i had not only been screwing but had enjoyed itwell i thought theyd write a nice letter explaining the mistake in accepting me and that would be the end of that so i jumped up and dashed home to compose a letter then i thought that wont get to them soon enough id better send a wire so i did to the school of social work directorof placement please be advised stop i have screwed stop it was good stop so there explanation point yours in freedom kim i thought that they would really be sick of me the minute they receive that i got a long involved letter explaining how proud they were that i was open to new things and that they were very pleased at my level of honesty i tell you i was peed thats the only way to describe it and what the heck did she mean new things id been screwing since i was ten if you want to count the times before it was serious and he wasnt new anyway i was truly indignant but bertha discouraged me from expressing my feelings to the school by just demoralizing my whole intellectual thing well yes it was a calculated intellectual involvement you see i never act on my unabridged emotions emotions are to be controlled by the intellect even when i act in what could be considered an emotional manner i have thought it out before and have decided this will be the way i act so to have my whole intellectual bag blown sky high right before my eyes well that was frightening i started to give bertha a quick punch in the gut but my whole actionreaction syndrome began to reek of emotion so i just cooled it a bit and dropped a half teaspoon of drano in her coffee later during the day strange about that i was only playing a little joke and there was plenty of milk on hand you see to help offset the effects so bertha drank her coffee and went to the john and never once indicated that anything was wrong later when i asked she did say it had been awfully runny but that was all im a failure i told myselfa failure oh goody im a failure i dont have to deal with it anymore i dashed a telegram off to the director of placement please be advised stop have put drano in roommates coffee stop she lives stop i am a failure you must reject me stop those ridiculous people up there just considered it a bid for attention i got a nice long letter explaining how they realized i hadnt received my placement yet and they were sorry but that they had a lot of work and sometimes even the best of us get tied down etc plus if you can dig it they think i have ingenious way of letting them know my needs i mean really ingenious goddamit i am a failure if i dont find a decent quick way out of this why ill end up in an institutiona part of an agencybeing decent responsibleall those ugly sick things that i hate id really have to think of a scheme it was way in the middle of april before it even dawned on me i mean it was so simple that i was overlooking the obvious what is the one thing we know for damned sure about white people i mean you know beside the fact that they hate negroes children and sex what is the one thing we know absolutely and positively about any honkie anywhere in the world that he worships money hes got such a case on money hes transferred it to anything green thats why you see those goddam keep off the grass signs not that he cares about grass but that its green whats the quickest way to turn a honkie off ask him for money hes as nice as he can be as long as he thinks hell get your moneybut the minute you ask him for some well thats like asking a hippie for his pot or a negro for his knife i mean they get hostile you dont believe it go into any bank and deposit five bucks then go back in a week and with draw it when you go to deposit it theyre all smiles the vp will come out and shake your hand the teller smiles and welcomes you to the family and thats only five bucks im talking about when you go to withdraw it the first thing the teller will say is you realize this will close your account just like you didnt know that if you deposit five bucks and you withdraw five bucks that you were closing your account and you just smile at him and say yeah groovy hell frown and say this will cost you one dollar and you say cool gimme my four bucks then he says this will take a minute thats when you look at him very menacingly and say i should surely hope the hell not then hell slam your money down and scream next or hell slap the next window please sign up and turn his back on you and this is a black teller im talking about so knowing this i wrote the director of placement and told her i had no money that i needed a stipend and a tuition grant i just knew for whatever my charm or whatnot that they werent going to pay me to go to their school i mean as tight as they are they are not about to give me any money i was as happy as a yearold turkey the day before thanksgivingi knew i now had them by the assi was just naturally too tough to handle i walked a little taller breathed a little deeper felt a little prouder i was so happy that i went back to my revolutionary work not that i hadnt been working for revolution all alongbut i had really been hung up on this thing about a job we set up a black arts festival and i was working my youknowwhatoff you may have heard about me being on the radio telling all the honkies not to come im sure you heard about lonnie going into the honkie neighborhood with his sign saying youre not ready it was great advertisement for us and we were all really sorry about that kid however though the papers played it down after the first day it is not true that lonnie tore his leg from the jointhe only fractured it and contrary to first reports the kid will walk again i personally tell all the brother black belts i know that they shouldnt provoke white kids then beat on them but well youre not always able to control folks even if they do take a lot of your advice but that was the only incident that could be in some quarters considered unfortunate it was a groovy set the blue beasts foamed at the mouth but it was our day i say again it was revolutionary slavetown usa was back in the movement cause the kim was back into her thing i really forgot all that crap about school and jobs and do i just put it out of my mind our underground press yes it does have something to do with why im late you see we were putting out a magazine called love black it was a group thing you know but it really belonged to all the people we had learned the secret of why the folks dont read cmon see do you know you jive they can too read but nobody ever writes for them or writes anything they can relate to so having figured that out through the very difficult process of stopping every brother we could on the corner one day and asking them what they would enjoy reading we went about getting love black out see most folks dont read honkies especially but people too you think they really read gh or time they look at the pictures and will scan any article they can see the end of most people like to read what they can see the end of so we started a black mag on vi x with articles that ran a page or less also it doesnt run over pages all toto therefore a brother can read the whole damned thing mag and really do two things learn something positive about himself and complete something he started now dont start breaking into my explanation it may well be propaganda but all pieces of paper with writing are propaganda and if i have to deal in mindcontrol its much better to be black washed i mean the honkie press and stuff just naturally screws with any black mans mind cause first it doesnt recognize that there is a black mind it does what it can to a black mindit whitewashes it it flushes it out of his head thats what it does but we were giving the people something and we were getting a lot one issue we were late and all kinds of soul stepped up and told me if i didnt get my thing together and get the mag out well they would look upon that with disfavor and they also sent articles in like wed get slightly used toilet tissue with an article on it or brown paper bags with short sayings or just a note to say they dig us some of it looked like our ancestral writing egyptian and we really had to work at deciphering it but when you saw how the man changed after he had published well it would really hit you you see the brother will read if hes writing it or if he knows people who are and love black was strictly ours it wasnt the prettiest thing in the world and sometimes it wasnt too clear ive always maintained that if we lose the revolution itll be because we know nothing about machinery but it was ours it talked about slavetown and what the brother thought and felt and the brother was digging it you got to understand the whole concept of writing like in the east everything is dishonest they do a lot of things but mostly its three thousand per cent b s the people are so used to talking black buying black and thinking black they dont get shook no more every hustler why is it a black capitalist is called a hustler and every panhandler is black so black dont mean nothing its taken for granted and one black thing is like another theyve been saturated with a program that has never come off between garvey and malcolm harlem should be owned lock stock and barrel by usbut we are still trying to get rat control and jobs and paying rent to circumcised honkies in the dupont plantation state they even passed a law that said if building codes arent lived up to you can deposit your money in one of the company banks and leave it then til the cat comes round aint that the jivest crap you ever heard of i mean paternalism with a capital white no wait a minute if you live in a house or apartment and something is wrong with it and you are living there everyday the good lord makes you black well you should fix that place up and whats left over from rent should go in your pocket so the old witch from the welfare department comes down and tries to explain that shell have to hold your check if you dont pay your rent to the rightful owner and thats when you come out of your thing so righteously and whip it on her so beautifully you just light up a joint and calmly explain that honkies have made women bombs and kellogs corn flakes but they have never made a piece of land the land is one bitch that is everybodys woman and i being man and all have got a right to a piece of her you see the honkies whole sex thing is tied up to land no lie land is their love all land except germany is female the motherland her sheall land is woman and they do anything to prove that they are worthy to be lands man only land dont give a crap about white people see land has this memory thing land remembers god stepped out on space and looked around and said ill make me a man god reached down into land a woman and formed this thingyou know a man now land has always been black and you know god well enough to know that he goes firstclass so god got the best land he could find which had to be the blackest land he could find you just dont know about no white land snow maybe some white sand maybe but you just dont know about no white land and land is hip to that land is very put out that we are making her prostitute herself for the beast you didnt hear about no land being raped until the beast came along we live in harmony with land because we are a part of land and we are out of land the honky came from sand and snow now what is that thats nothing it has a place on earth but its nothing snow freezes land and sand dries her up both destroy land and land wants to live and recreate you run it on down to where you are going to free land so that she can go about womans work of taking care of her childrenthe black people of the earth now shell send the law out but that dont mean nothing either the law only means something if you think it does so shell send out the law to make you pay and you smile sincerely and promise to get it in next week after youre alone with your piece of land you remove very carefully anything that cannot be replaced like pictures of your first lay your joints etc and you throw kerosene on everything else you see its yours and if you cant enjoy it in freedom and peace then land wants you to destroy it you cant destroy land because itll always be there but you can destroy the rapists claim stake the only thing about that land that makes the beast think he owns it is the claim hes stakeda house a building a fenceso you destroy that thats when you burn you dont bum to get the thief to fix it up you burn when youve staked your claim and they try to steal it from you and i really believe that after youve fixed it up and made it yours youll kill for it thats the one thing weve got to understand this revolution isnt to show what were willing to die for black people have been willing to die for damned near everything on earth its to show what were willing to kill for yes it is do we love life enough to deal righteously with key honkies we dont have to deal with king and young and those other three or four if we dont want to we have got to deal with the folks who send them up which means we have to control ourselves i have got to control me and you have got to control you like if i see something that needs to be done and you see something else we dont got to argue about what to do you do yours and ill do mine its like were on a road that forks off then comes back together we just had different priorities and that dont make one right or wrong just different but if i use the fact that you want to do something i dont want to do to keep from doing what i have to do then im not together im b sing and i know it see you and i are never in a conflict situation cause were after the same thingwere after the same honky and however we get him is our business all that jive about coordination and keeping people in line and elites and crap dont really mean nothing thats not revolutionthats not anarchy and anarchy is what we want this country doesnt have anything that we cant build again if we need it but to even try to think of taking over and preserving gm or something what for nobodys trying to make the system black were trying to make a system human so that black folks can live in it that means were trying to destroy the system its not even a question of whether black folks can run it better than white folks we dont have to prove to whities that we canand if we take over their system thatll be the reason we havent got to prove nothing to honkies cause they are nobodys authority on nothing but the whole damn thing i do blame on bertha cause i was just as happy sitting at home twittering my toes and masturbating every now and then i didnt even know that i was colored let alone anything about blackness but she kept bringing those beautiful black people home and they kept talking that talk to me and as i moved i moved toward black_power and i recognized the extent of white power which is so pervasive that the american solution cannot be black_power at all though as a world solution it is a possibility but must be revolutionanarchy total chaosand this should not be so hard for us since we have worked so diligently in every other cause we can now work for our own we have sacrificed our lives and interests for white power and now we can save ourselves through revolutionour baptism by fire but as i worked this out people kept calling me a hater and really im a lover no one knows how much i do love all that is lovable then bertha chimed in to ask do i love black folks enough to trust them to tcb and do i trust black people to do those things necessary by any means necessary recognizing that the means is in fact the ends she kept saying that if they and i are one then i should get out of the way and see where they would go without me and since revolution ages you so quickly and having watched the summer i had to admit that i was old and tired and recognized that already we were moving beyond my vision so maybe i should step aside and regroup so i packed and made arrangements to come to school and everybody cheered and was really pleased with my decision and i kept telling myself that it would be good and that i was dealing with the best the system had to offer and that if i couldnt relate meaningfully enough to them for me to accept them then i could easily go back to destroying it in a very real manner so having made my decision i decided to walk i mean it would have been much too tjh to hop a flight or thumb a ride ana though physical punishment of m self doesnt negate the total import of my act it did serve as a human extension of myself to help offset my total feeling of wasting my time and i had no idea you were so far away from uncle toms cabin in slavetown i had thought i could make it in a day or two but its taking much longer im really sorry about holding you up and all but its done now and here i am see can you handle it soon one morning the wheels of years of slavery ceased turn the i dont to know precise way in which it happened but i can sketch the events for you the sun had just started coming the semidarkness the at the gate of up and in men gathered white plantation the fence some elbows some support for their backs no one was nervous the they leaned on resting on their using the fence as a theyd all time a few much waiting though waiting a long make veyed the leaving the and nurtured they had been more minutes couldnt difference they surland which they were land they had coaxed from which each which brought forth seas of cotton none of them supposed that he would miss this place each had been moving all his life trying to find someplace where his work would do him some good where after five or six years of labor he could have enough set aside so that his wife and children could rest from the crippling work in the fields ironically most of them had come over to this place in the miss ssippi delta from the hills expecting to find a land of opportunity they had been told that they could make a lot of money over in the deltas cottonfields so they had left sharecropping in the hills slipping off in the night so that the bossman wouldnt know they were going they owed him money he had furnished them so that they could livethat is subsisteach year to produce another crop for him old man brown twisted around so that he leaned sideways on the gate even though he was in his fifties he was still a handsome man his skin a reddish brown his black hair richly mixed with grey closing his eyes to the growing brilliance of the sun he chewed on a long blade of grass and thought back over the years he had invested in this land it had been a long time since hed done thisthink back mostly he had applied his energies to coping with the present to making it through a day in the field to stretching a dollar to feed people the past for the old man was his big girl frankie mae she was his first child bom years ago shed lain in the fields while he and his wife mattie made their first crop and when they lived in the hills she had gone everywhere with him he had a blue bicycle with a rusty wire basket in the front he used to put frankie mae in the basket and ride her to town with him and to church and sometimes they would go nowhere special just riding she fitted so well into the basket that for a few years the old man thought that the basket was growing with the child but when frankie reached six she became too large to ride with him also he had four more children by then so he bought a car for not long after frankie mae stopped riding in the basket he became restless he had heard about how you could make a lot of money over in the delta so he decided to go over there he packed what he could carry in one loadthe children a few chickens and a mattressand slipped off one night frankie mae sat next to him on the drive chattering while he drove excited about the promising new place where they would live when a tire blew out she would climb out to help him while the others slept she knew the tools to be used and would bring them to him just the minute before he turned to ask for them at six she was a beautiful black child with delicate limbs and huge green eyes that seemed to glow in the dark she was always alive and happy the only thing wrong was that she got hurt so easily the slightest rebuke sent her crying the least hint of disapproval left her moody and depressed for hours on the other hand she had a way of springing back from pain no matter how hurt she was she would be her old self by the next day the old man worried over her he wanted most to cushion her life to protect her from the sharp points on which he had been cut he understood later that that was why he had moved to the delta maybe he would be able to make enough to get her out of the south get her some clothes and put her into a nice school somewhere two days after they left the hills they drove up to the white plantation in leflore county mississippi they were given a creaky tworoom house and told the conditions of their stay they would work acres on shares percent to them and to the bossman the fertilizer the packaging and any other such expenses would be deducted from their percent they would be furnished a month for living expenses while they were making the crop the old man and mattie worked hard that year up at breakfast of grits and syrup then out to the field frankie mae stayed behind to nurse the other children and to watch the pot of beans which was cooking for dinner at noon they would come in and eat with the children and then be gone again until dark they would drag themselves home eat some bread and syrup and get ready for the next daydo a little sweeping snap some beans wash for the baby then they would sit on the porch together for maybe a half hour that was the time the old man liked best the half hour before bed frankie mae would tell him the events of the daya man from town had come by and tried to take their stove because they were three months behind in their payments frankie had told him she had just that morning seen a money order come in the mail from uncle ed and she had heard her daddy say he was going to use it to pay off the stove man the man believed the story and left the stoveor she would tell how willie b the three year old had wandered off the porch and hit his head on a rock she had carried him down the road to the woman they called granny who was too old to work in the fields but who stayed resolutely on in her little shack she said i know mr white junior aint gonna put me out it dont look right i work for him all my life and make him rich and then he try to put me out even white folks dont get that low honey no i aint moving granny had wrapped up the childs head and given him some aspirin along with the admonition to be careful and stop causing grown folks trouble during their half hour the old man would tell frankie what a good job she had done that day he would go on about how smart she was going to be when she started schoolwhich would be in two years when the oldest boy was big enough to take care of the others she would sit straight up and her green eyes would glow at his praise and then she would join him in a well rehearsed exchange they were going to make a lot of moneyyes five hundred dollars and go far awayyes and buy a washing machine for mama and a big rocking chair for the old man yes yes after a while mattie would pick up the baby and go inside the others would follow and they would fall into the two beds which were stacked high with worn out mattresses and newspapers and blankets the next morning they would be up again at the end of the year just before christmas they went to settle up they learned that they were in the hole they owed mr white junior on next years crop the old man didnt see how this could have happened yes he had borrowed money to eat and to pay three doctor bills but how could the figures have come out so badly against him yet there it was on paper what he owed and why the bossman offered to let him have some money for christmas but he refused he hated to get still deeper in debt he and mattie went home and told the children no christmas this year they would try to do better next year he was sad he had wanted terribly to buy a doll for frankie mae to give her something to play with during the snatches of time when she wasnt tending the children or doing chores he knew just the doll too a huge doll blond with smooth white skin it wore a blue satin dress and stood in front of the long white columns of a cardboard plantation big house he knew that frankie stood in front of this scene in the store window for hours whenever they went to town he would get it for her the next year next year turned out to be the same only a few things were changed the debt was higher because the earlier had to be added on to it now they owed and mr white junior decided to take them off shares all the hands would work together in whatever field he chose he would pay a day for chopping cotton and by the hundred pounds for picking the hands had no choice they could work by the day or leave actually it didnt make much difference they werent making any money on shares anyhow also the old man was made the timekeeper over the other workers that year as timekeeper the old man was given a large battered watch and told to see that the workers in the field made a full day if someone got sick and had to leave brown had to know because no one was paid for less than a day it was also his job to see that no one rested too long in the field they had to keep moving or go home and he had to see to it that all the weeds were kept out of the cotton the job was hard for him but he figured he treated the hands as well as anybody in his position could he had to see that the work was done and at the same time give the workers as much slack as he possibly could the worst part was in keeping after the women whose time was about to come he hated to see them drag themselves to the field their bellies almost bursting they were supposed to keep pace with the others which was impossible yet they had to work at it the best way they could and try to make it through the day because they had to make the to pay esther the midwife the old man would feel a pain in his chest when mr white junior would slip up on them and find one of the big bellied women lagging behind the others the woman would be sent home walkingsometimes three or four miles depending on the field they were working mr white junior didnt carry hands home except to eat dinner and after the day had been made even if the woman had made six or seven hours she still had to go home without the and brown would be cursed for not watching the hands more closely one day when he had carried the hands in from the field mr white junior stopped the old man as he was climbing down from the back of the pickup truck johnnie he said it dont look right to me for you to leave a girl at home that could be working when i need all the hands i can get this cotton cant wait on you all to get ready to chop it i want frankie mae out there tomorrow he had tried to resist but we getting along with what me and mattie makes aint got nothing but we eating i wants frankie mae to go to school we can do without the few dollars she would make mr white junior didnt bother to answer this he swung into his truck and started the motor framed by his shotgun which hung from a rack in the rear window he said get that girl down here tomorrow dont nobody stay in my house and dont work and he skidded off that night the old man dreaded the half hour on the porch when frankie had started school that year she had already been two years late and she had been so excited about going every night for months they talked about how much she was learning and all the nice people she metshe would probably make up those two years in no time they could double promote smart childrenprobably she would get a job as a schoolteacher when she finished and wear a white blouse every day when the wood had been gathered and the children cleaned up he followed frankie onto the sloping porch she started telling him about the magnificent yellow bus in which she rode to school he sat down next to her on the step frankie mae im got to tell you something whats that daddy mama say i been slow bout helping round the house since i been going to school i do better guess lost my head over the schoolhouse no baby that aint it at all you been helping your mama fine he stood up to face her but could not bring his eyes to the level of her bright face mr white junior stopped me today when i was getting off the truck say he want you to come to field til the chopping get done she found his eyes oh and what did you say daddy well i told him how you wanted to go to school and we could do without your little money but he say you got to go the childs eyes lost their brilliance her shoulders slumped and she began to cry softly tired the old man sat back down on the step he took her hand and sat with her on the porch long after mattie and the children had gone to bed as he sat in the darkness he held tightly to the smooth little hand soon it would be hard and calloused the next morning frankie was up first she woke up her daddy and the others scolding them for being so slowthey had to go get all that cotton chopped no sense in wasting good daylight time in sleeping brown sat up in the bed he was already dressed since he had felt too tired to take off his clothes the night before he got up and threw some water on his face then he smiledthats how frankie mae was she would feel real bad terrible for a few hours but she always snapped back she would be all right now on the way to the field he said baby im gonna make you the watergirl all you got to do is carry water over to them that hollers for it and keep your bucket full you dont have to chop none lest you see mr white junior coming no daddy thats all right the other hands will say you was letting me off easy cause im yours say you taking advantage of being timekeeper ill go on and pick with the rest he tried to argue with her but she wouldnt let him give her the water bucket finally he put her next to mattie so she could learn from her as he watched over the field he forced himself not to think about his child inhaling the cotton dust and insecticide when his eyes happened on frankie mae and mattie their backs bent over he quickly averted them once when he jerked his eyes away he found instead the bright yellow school bus bouncing along the road frankie learned quickly how to chop the cotton and even seemed to find something about it to enjoy sometimes when they were working in a remote field the choppers would go at noon to the store for their dinner instead of going home they would buy sardines or canned sausages and crackers these they would have with pork and beans which they ate from jaggededged cans at the store the old man would watch with pride as frankie laughed and talked with everyone if there were hands from town she would make a point of going over and being friendly with them and she would make dates to attend church with the ladies at the different churches in town and on the other plantations every sunday frankie had a service to go to their own church met for service only once a month on the third sunday so on the other sundays she went visiting the old man went with her sometimes because he liked so much to see her enjoy herself that year they finished the chopping in june it was too late to send frankie back to school and she couldnt go again until after the cotton had been picked when she went back to school in november she had missed four months and found it hard to keep up with the children who had been going all the time still she went every day that she could she stayed home only when she had to when her mother was sick or when in the cold weather she didnt have shoes to wear whenever she learned that she couldnt go to school on a particular day she would withdraw into herself for an hour or so and then she would smile and make the best of it by easter time she could write her name and read a little and add simple figures when company came the old man would call her to read them some passages from the family bible when it came time to chop the cotton again she had to stop school once more that was how the years went in the fall and spring brown carried her and the other children who were over eight years old to the field with him and in the winters he sent them to school as many days as he could some years frankie was promoted to the next grade and some years when she had missed five or six out of the nine school months she wasnt if it was possible the old man loved her still more now he saw the children of the other workers and his own children too get discouraged and stop going to school they said it was too confusing they never knew what the teacher was talking about because they had not been there the day before or the month before and they resented being left behind in classes with children half their size he saw the other children reach the point where they wouldnt hold themselves up wouldnt try to be clean and make folks respect them yet every other day his frankie mae managed to put on a clean starched dress and if she couldnt go to school that day she wore the dress for their half hour on the porch by the time frankie was she could figure as well as the preacher and she was made secretary of the church that same year she asked her daddy if she could keep a record of what they spent during the year the old man was proud for her to do this he felt like something was wrong when each year he came out owing money but he didnt know how to do anything about it maybe this year with frankie to help him he could come out ahead he promised her that if it was possible any way this year he would buy her a sunday dress from the store in town it would be her first storebought dress he gave her all his receipts from the last seven years frankie bought a black and white speckled notebook she put in it what they made and what they paid on their bill after chopping time she became excited they had just about paid the bill out she and the old man would sit on the porch and go over the figures and plan what they would buy for christmas sometimes they even imagined that they would take a drive up to chicago to see uncle ed frankie told him that this year she would go to her first christmas dance at the schoolhouse in her new dress every so often he would try to hold down her excitement by reminding her that the figures would have to be checked against the bossmans figures but sne was so proud to be using what she had learned to help the family that he felt bad about saying things to discourage her just before christmas tne families on the place went to settle up for the year settling up meant finding out what they owed for the year before and borrowing as much as the man would let them have so that they could buy themselves some christmas when it came to the old mans turn he trembled a little it was almost too much to hope for that they would have money coming to them instead of owing it all the year he had kept from thinking about it too seriously except for m the times when frankie pulled him into her planning he motioned to frankie mae and went with her to the table where there were several stacks of five and ten dollar bills a big ledger and a pistol he took heart from the absolute confidence with which frankie mae walked next to him and controlled his tremblingmaybe the child was right and they had something coming to them hey there johnnie mr white junior said see you brought frankie mae along fine fine good to start them early here have a seat the old man gave frankie the one chair and stood besde her the bossman riffled his papers and came out with a long narrow sheet brown recognized his name at the top here you are johnnie yall come out pretty good this year proud of you dont owe but since you done so good gonna let you have for christmas frankie mae spoke up i been keeping a book for my daddy and i got some different figures let me show you there was a stillness in the room everyone while pretending not to notice the girl was listening intently to what she said mr white junior looked surprised but he recovered quickly why sure be glad to look at your figures you know its easy to make a mistake ill show you what you done wrong brown clutched her shoulder to stop her from handing over the book but it was too late already she was leaning over the table comparing her figures with those in mr white juniors ledger see mr white junior when we was chopping last year we made and you took of that to put on our bill there there it is in your book and we borrowed in july there it is as she talked the other workers lifted and turned their heads until they were all looking straight at the black girl who was leaning over the table explaining to mr white junior that they had the same figures the man behind the table grew red one of his hands gripped the table while the other moved toward the pistol frankie mae finished so you see you owe us for the year the bossman stood to gain the advantage of his height he seemed about to burst his eyes flashed wildly around the room and his hand clutched the pistol he was just raising it from the table when suddenly he caught hold of himself he took a deep breath and let go of the gun oh yeah i remember what happened now johnnie it was that slip i gave you to the doctor for willie b you remember last year before chopping time i got the bill last week it came to let me think yeah that was the old mans tension fell away from him and he resumed his normal manner he knew exactly what the bossman was saying it was as he had expected as it had always been lets go baby he said but frankie didnt get up from the chair for a moment she looked puzzled then her face cleared she said but willie b didnt have anything wrong with him but a broken arm the doctor spent minutes with him one time and minutes the other that couldnt cost no whites hand found the pistol again and gripped it until the knuckles were white the old man pulled frankie to him and put his arm around her with his free hand he fingered his own pistol which he always carried in his pocket he was not afraid but he hated the thought of shooting the man even if he just knicked him it would be the end for himself and who would take care of mattie and the children already he had done three years on the state farm he knew what it was like and he never wanted to go back there he drew a line for himself if mr white junior touched him or frankie he would shoot him short of that he would leave without a fight the bossman spat thick brown tobacco juice onto the floor spattering it on the old man and the girl nigger he said i know you aint disputing my word dont nobody live on my place and call me no liar that bill was you understand me he stood tense staring with hatred at the man and the girl everyone waited for browns answer the old man felt frankies arms go round his waist tell him no daddy we right not him i kept them figures all year they got to be right the gates of the state farm flashed through the old mans mind he thought of mattie already sick from high blood trying to make a living for people frankies arms tightened yessir he said i understand the girls arms dropped from him and she started to the door the other workers turned away to fiddle with a piece of rope or to scold a child brown accepted the which was thrown across the table to him as he turned to follow frankie he heard mr white juniors voice low now and with a controlled violence hey you girl frankie mae she stopped at the door know this white continued long as you live im gonna be right and you gonna be wrong now get your black ass outta here the child stumbled out to the car and crawled onto the back seat she cried all the way home brown tried to quiet herthey had done the best they could next year would be better she still could have the sunday dress the next morning he laid in bed waiting to hear frankie mae moving around and fussing that was how he knew each time that she had snapped back to her old self he laid there until everyone in the house had gotten up still he did not hear her finally he got up and went over to where she was balled up in the blankets he woke her she raised herself listlessly and went to throw some water on her face she didnt even bother to change the dress in which she had slept when the schoolbus came she said she had a stomach ache and wouldnt be going brown sat out on the porch all day long wishing that she would join him and struggling to understand what had happened this time frankie had not bounced back to her old brighteyed self the line which held her to this self had been stretched too taut it had lost its tension and had fallen slack at her side frankie never again kept a book for her daddy she lost interest in things such as numbers and reading she went to school as an escape from chores but got so little of her lessons done that she was never promoted from the fourth grade to the fifth when she was and in the fourth grade she had her first child after that there was no more thought of school in the following four years she had three more children she sat around the house eating and growing fat when well enough she went to the field with her daddy it wasnt that she was sullen or evil just disinterested in anything outside the tworoom shack her dresses were seldom ironed now whatever she could find to wear would do still there were a few times maybe once every two or three months when she was lively and fresh she would get dressed and clean the children up and have her daddy drive them to church on such days she would be the first one up she would have food on the stove before anybody else had a chance to dress it was for these isolated times that the old man waited they kept him believing that she would get to be all right until the day she died he woke up every morning listening for her laughter waiting for her to pull the covers from his feet and scold him for being lazy she died giving birth to her fifth child the midwife esther was good enough but she didnt know what to do when there were complications frankie mae bled to death on the hundred mile drive to the charity hospital in vicksburg the old man squinted up at the fully risen sun the bossman was late he should have been at the gate by this time well it didnt matter just a few more minutes and they would be through with this place forever his thoughts went back again to the time when the civil_rights workers had first come around and they had started their meetings up at the store they had talked about voting and about how black people should have the same rights as whites and they had talked about how plantation workers should be making enough to live on brown and the other men had listened and talked and agreed so they decided to ask mr white junior for a raise thev would ask for the men to be paid for their hour work day well they had asked and he had said hell no before he would raise them he would lower them so they agreed to ask him again and if he still said no they would go on strike at first brown hadnt understood himself why he agreed to the strike it was only this morning that he realized why it was frankies wideeyed children there were two the two dark ones who moved around him with a terrible solemnity which seemed to continually rebuke him for the absence of their mother even during his scattered moments of gayety their green eyes followed him he couldnt send them the way frankie had gone not if he had a chance to do better and this strike was the chance he needed a cloud of dust rose up in front of brown the bossman was barrelling down the road in his pickup truck he was mad that was what he did when he got mad got in his truck and drove wildly up and down the road brown chuckled when they got through with him this morning he probably would run that truck into the river you see mr white junior didnt believe that they would quit him they had all left him at one time or another to try out some other plantation and all had come back some had gone and come back two or three times so he thought they were bluffing when they demanded the raise now he would find out differently he climbed down from the truck and mrde h s way over to the gate he began to give the orders for the day who would work in the shop what fields would be chopped what tractors would be used the men moved away from the fence disdaining any support for what they were about to do one of the younger men james lee spoke mr white junior we wants to know is you gonna raise us like we asked no goddammit now go on do what i told you then james lee continued we got to go on strike from this place james lee and the others began to leave the gate which had bound up the years of their lives ben handed mr white junior the keys to the shop and the old man handed him the scarred watch that had kept track of his peoples wastage of life and energy in the hot endless rows of cotton the watch that had ticked away frankie maes youth leaving her broken and dreamless at i think it was the moment when the old man handed over the watch that for these men and their families the wheels of slavery ground to a halt the south that shug remembers is one of morning dew covered greenfields hookyday fishing on the tombigbee river and dollar cricket catchbut that is the south of a seven year old wagonbox happy rider it was a long time ago when shug was seven riding wagons catching crickets shug is riding south now passing dewcovered greenfields fhe is approaching the death of a father he has left something almost the same as a slow dying a daily struggle for survival and shug the rider knows that the father that he must see dying has been dead for a lifetime he died when he sent shug north to ghettoland at seven to become polluted and to fight a losing battle for survival now to fight forever the rider passes through green tree hamlets filled with greenfields and mossfilled shady lanes departing and approaching slow death far away he sees tree top landscaping and all the mossfilled trees on shady river banks look exactly as he remembers mossfilled trees twentyone years ago along the tombigbee river looking out the dark glass at the lonely telephone poles shug thinks of north the winters the winds basement a mother dying leaving him all alone alone it was lonely in ghettoland then december bleak but no dying embers warmed shugs year old body each gust of cold wind found its way into the dark hallway where he tried to sleep and with each gust of wind shug mumbled curses back at the dawn cursing did not stop the wind it had so many entrances it had a young boy homeless ragged that wind had shug captured jailed he could not blow his nose as he wanted because he was afraid he might wake the daynight sleepers within the house had him so that he could sleep only until he heard movements from the sleepers in the house or until the december dawn entered into daybreak the december wind bit and pricked shugs black body taking advantage of its opportunities cold frightened ragged praying for a father a remembered south without that which ones values depend not able to find it work for it shug was lost in north ghettoland could there be any warm and pretty places for him to sleep tomorrows or would he forever dream of other hallways in other tomorrows shug sat up rubbed his body and gymshoe covered feet trying to get circulation in frozen blackness listened to the wind blow wanted to blow his nose could not felt the cold mucous running down and over his mouth wanted to sneeze wanted wanted to remember what it was like to eat a warm breakfast wanted to remember the taste of grits and eggs cooked food could not shug was in ghettoland and not a remembered dewcovered southland ma cold help me his mother could not hear him her struggle was over ma he said take my cricket money he wiped his nose the tears from his eyes man what you talking about crickets for a rat greygreen wet and cold too entered with the next gust of wind looked at shug shaking went up the stairs scratched at the door silence who entering from that outside world of white and light could help shug he rested his head against the wall of the hall teeth chattered rattled it was so cold so dark in that hallway its always so cold and dark shug was thinking it was cold and dark that morning when the city ambulance took his mother away that morning the wind and the ice became one and ghettoland rested cold silent as if deciding whether to eat its people for warmth and shug one of the people must be eaten by it or he must destroy it knowing this watching them take her away shug hoped that outside world would come although violence was around him he had never destroyed nature beyond the cricket not able to scream in rage shug could only pray frozen prayers to nature or destroy it that morning the wind and the snow as one whirled and twisted lodging itself here and there in the transparent dwellings through that land before entering shug and his mothers basement bottom dark it was away down there he moved around fumbling in darkness giving his mother the drugstore medicine the broth he vaguely re membered her making when he was sick with cold hearing her cough that faint cough she had suffered with for so long shug wondered when the other world of white and light omnipotence would come dark it was down there in that basement when his mother stopped coughing and so very dark it was when he watched them take her away from his young life that outside world of white and light did not come looking out of the glass door into dawn he saw the snow falling so white and beautiful that he wanted to enter it looked again at his gym shoes again out the glass door heard his empty stomach growl listened to the wind blow damn man you need something to eat picked up his cardboard box with the odds planned to take them to the junkyard could use the box later after he sold the two pieces of iron to make a fire could warm his hands and feet shug cautiously went out into the pretty white snow where you go man where you get something to eat shug moved a little faster had read in a comic book how this guy lost in the cold forest kept warm by running through the alleys of that land searching through garbage cans for a morning breakfast somewhere shug found a biscuit somewhere he found an end piece of wonder bread sat in the snow eating the frozen food why you here man had been to the welfarehave your mother come in adc fathers name the people mister loan me fifty cent had been what bright places could shug go tomorrow that were dark yesterdays school look at shugs old clothes look at his shoes he

jackson shug looked in the direction of the valley and his long ago home through the glass darkly seconds of wagonbox happiness he smiled the bus was soon leaving jackson crossing the tombigbee bridge moving swiftly down the dark highway it approached his father it departed that prison and shug the rider thought of yesterdays and tomorrowsdreams is them other lone riders lonely as me the greyhound bus slowed as it passed highway construction black prisoners in bright stripes labored with the red alabama earth singing in deep bass unison as guards kept rifles pointed some smiled and waved to the bus and even together each seemed alone had he appeared that way when he died at seven and again at what kind of loneliness is this death will my daddy seem as he vaguely seemed yesterdays mobile

nature nd needs of the ck ersity by gerald mcworter evolutionary change for the liberation of a people from oppressive social structures is not the special function of one course of action but more likely the result of several and while education is generally hoped to be a liberating force on mens minds and bodies ofttimes it has been used as a debilitating tool in the interests of an oppressive society accordingly kwame nkrumah compares the colonial student educated for the art of forming not a concrete environmental view of social political problems but an abstract liberal outlook with the revolutionary student animated by a lively national consciousness who sought knowledge as an instrument of national emancipation and integrity so it is becoming rather clear that educational institutions are vital to a liberation movement a fact of negro digest march modern times in anticolonial movements in the third world in the united states there is no question about the persistence of segregation racism and more subtle forms of neoracism as the pernicious oppression of racism is an organic part of the institutions symbols and values of western industrial society so it is firmly entrenched in the usa as american as apple pie an afro american liberation movement must subvert andor supplant such a wellentrenched social system if it is to be a real source of radical change and not a false one my primary task in this discussion is an ideological consideration of the role of a university in the liberation of the afroamerican community it must be clear that this role has to deal with todays world as well as with what ought to be and certainly it must include the management of whatever social change is required to move effectively from the is to the ought the university is alive for people in the world including all of the socioeconomic and political hangsup involved and so must meet the challenge of responding creatively to whatever needs exist now for those people but at the same time it must project itself as a prophetic institution calling into question all that which is inconsistent with its highest ideals and organizing its activities to bring about the realization of its ideals the focus of this discussion is on what ought to be the prophetic social role of the black university for therein lies the fountainhead of revolutionary liberation we must be reminded of this same theme as stated by dr w e b du bois over years ago in the niagro movement resolutions and when we call for education we mean real education education is the development of power and ideal we want our children trained as intelligent human beings should be and we will fight for all time against any proposal to educate black boys and girls simply as servants and underlings or simply for the use of other people they have a right to know to think to aspire we do not believe in violence but we do believe in that willingness to sacrifice money reputation and life itself on the altar of right the booker t washingtondu bois dialectical opposition is relevant here as it is the important example of the is versus the ought concerning educational ideology for afroamericans training people to fit in where they can think of mdta job corps etc might be acceptable for short term solutions though not as washington thought it to be but the educational ideology of du bois is our prophecy a rationale to built a black universitythe crucible of definitive social change in order that the idea of the new university and the notions of how we are to achieve it as a goal will be more clearly understood it is important to discuss briefly the current social situation the current situation is one charged with a great deal of expectancy on the part of many afroamericans an expectancy frequently expressed by the emotional connotations of a term or phrase but usually not delineated in structural or programmatic terms but this programmatic deficiency is not so much a shortcoming for the exciting search for innovation and relevance is the first sign of progress a major question then is what conditions give rise to this expectancy this charged atmosphere crystallized around the term black university a major trend in todays world is that as oppressed people know that the world offers more than they have and as they are able to get a little more of it they also expect to get very much more this has been called the revolution of rising expectations a figurative example an afroamerican family gets a television set and enters as a spectator the world of affluent euroamerican society it is not complicated to see that this would lead to the family wanting more than it has much more just imasine how cruel it must be for poor oppressed black people to watch the giveaway quiz programs on which white people win appliances furniture and cars in minutes or so then think of a scene of ghetto destruction during which people brave armed police to steal appliances furniture and cars in minutes or so oppressed people see what is going on and want in in the best way they can get in yes by any means necessary to do it right now along with this developing desire to get more out of society there also is the increasing saliency of a nationalistic alternative to the system the general components are militancy selfdetermination and a desire to identify with similar oppressed people throughout the world who are not by accident mostly colored people this alternative is grounded in communalism and finds its legitimacy from within afroamerica and not outside of it nationalism in this context means total concern for the community of common experience so afroamerican nationalism is grounded in the black experience communalism meaning selfhelp cooperative efforts is the ethic supporting the new alternative these two major trends cannot be viewed outside of the total context of world events especially those events of particular relevance to the afroamerican community the militaryindustrial machine of the western powers is equally offensive and outraging in vietnam and south africa in santo domingo and ghana but it seems apparent that peoples can only unite across the world in aspiring for the same universalspeace freedom and justicewhile focusing their working activities on the social ills as manifested at home if we are to reap a harvest of world brotherhood then each man must first tend to his own garden but for each garden to have its true meaning the gardener must know his historical role and his relationship with all others working for the same harvest the two trends are general social sources of the cry for a black university while everyone is more or less for such a thing as a university for some the quality of blackness imbues the concept with polemical emotional intensity and conceptual ambiguity or in extreme cases of racism this must be cleared up if the dialogue is to continue in reference to a university blackness must mean at least three things first blackness refers to the afroamerican community as the basic focus for the university this in no way compromises or limits its universalistic orientation or its attempts to contribute to human progress rather it frees it to be relevant in the face of an unmet need reflecting the woeful limit of human progress a second and more controversial point considers the limits placed on participation in the university blackness does not categorically exclude all white people from the university it redefines the standards for their participation and the possibility for their involvement in much the same way that independent african countries have attempted to redefine the possible role of the european so in the black university the role of the white man must be redefined and carefully placed for the maximum good of all some white people will be necessary for the immediate future if for no other reason than the black communitys own shortage of resources but unconditional participation will have to be ended the participation must be based on a commitment to the goals and aspirations of the afroamerican community and the white participant must possess the sacrificial humility necessary for one historically and socially identified with the beast of afroamerican history and the system of oppression last blackness is an affirmation of an identity independent of the historical human evils of modern nation states and is closely tied to the emerging international identity of man in his struggle for a better life consider this revelation by brother malcolm_x when on his pilgrimage to mecca that morning was when i first began to reappraise the white man it was when i first began to perceive that white man as commonly used means complexion only secondarily primarily it described attitudes and actions in america white man meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man and toward all other nonwhite men but in the muslim world i had seen men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been the relations between people must be allowed to grow and progress without the limiting problem of the national state who are we afroamericans men of the world why are we here we were sent here to love where are we going toward the community of love and if stopped we will continue by any means necessary because we must continue so much for prologue what is the black university idea all about what are its goals and what might it look like the university focusing on the particular needs of the afroamerican community will be a center of learning but recognizing the alternatives noted above by nkrumah it must be based on an educational ideology grounded in an uncompromising goal of psychological independence from the oppressor and his oppressive system and as much structural independence as is necessary not only to survive in the world but to prosper so education must be defined to specify these purposes as most important the american usa ethic of individualism is inclusive of both basic needs of men and the essence of a social style all men are to some extent selfcentered but to build a social group process on selfcenteredness is to hope for a just order through antagonistic cooperation the thrust of the black university must be to overcome this subtle social warlikestate with the ethic of communalism this means that instead of hoping for social progress through the individual merits of its students or faculty qua individuals progress is to be viewed as a social process through which the community is uplifted with the aid of its contributing people this then means that while students and faculty play a very vital role they are coworkers alongside the equally important others eg the community organizer the artist the union organizer moreover the goal of the university must be one of service to the community the students faculty and administration of the black universitv must consider themselves as servants to the broader afroamerican community being a member of the university must be considered an honor but more important this honor must be one involving responsibility to the total community and not simply focusing on the imadeitbecauseimsmarterthan kind of thinking being servants status is not based on the academic credentials university people create for themselves rather it is on the extent to which the total community is able to reap benefits from the service provided the service of the black university must not be one transmitted through mass communication or ritualistic ceremony but through a concrete programmatic movement toward liberation the time when the afroamerican community must be armslength from its institutions of higher education is over the pimps prostitutes preachers and phds must find a common bond to change themselves and weave an organic unity as the basis for liberation and a better life for all these goals must redefine two dangerouslypervasive patterns found among afroamerican faculty and students today one of the patterns is for education to be simply a process of acclimation and adjustment to the white world one goes to a white school to rub shoulders with them because son you got to make a livin out in their world another pattern is the playculture of friendship cliques and fraternity life whether it is mimicry of whites think of fort lauderdale in the spring or defection based on hopelessness we must find the recipe for a revolutionary discipline consistent with our desire for immediate radical change a free man is also and must be a responsible man and so must afroamerican students and faculty be responsible to themselves by being responsible to the black community the values of the black university must support the liberation movement of afroamericans oppressed people around the world and all that prevents man from leading the good life we must find a synthesis of efficient reason and purposive compassion the value placed on scientific methods must be joined by an equally important value placed on empathy ie sci entific detachment must be limited to method and technique complemented with involvement and commitment the students and faculty must be evangelical in their social roles and give new meaning to being a missionary for freedom and finally the black university must impart to all who are associated with it the strength to be alone the struggle against ignorance just as with the struggle of power is one within which the forces of good are often small in number and sparsely placed an afroamerican of the black university must have inner strength positive historical identity and a vision of the good for only in having these traits will he be able to stand up in a world dominated by evil and be secure even in being alone among its many functions the university is most concerned with knowledge both the accumulated information and insights of human history and the vision and process of new discovery and it is knowledge about afroamericans that is most lacking or biased and wrong in all these respects the black university is based on the fundamental assumption that the afroamerican community is in e franklin fraziers words a little social world a human universe heretofore misused or ignored by higher education consider these autobiographical comments by dr du bois when i went south to fisk i became a member of a closed racial group with rites and loyalties with a history and a corporate future with an art and philosophy into this world i leapt with provincial enthusiasm a new loyalty and allegiance replaced my americanism henceforth i was a negro the black university must respond creatively to just these realities which were true for du bois in and equally true for this author in the s the knowledge of afroamericans just as with africa is yet to be fully reclaimed with the full scope of university activities research teaching etc revision is needed to secure for colored peoples of the world their proper place in human history this revision of educational materials is a process as much political as it is scholarly with scholarly work a text of usa history can be written but only with political influence will it be made available by getting it published placed in a library or adopted as recommended reading however in the present it would be foolish to think of throwing everything aside revision of what is must be a thorough job of systematic and rigorous scholarship backed by the concerted political efforts of afroamerican students faculty and the entire community but more important and more difficult there is a need to find new styles of scholarship new forms of knowledge new ways of knowing these new developments must be consistent with what is to be known and have utility for the liberation movement there must be research on all aspects of the black experience research necessarily not limited to traditional scholarly disciplines but open to the demands of the subject for example the blues component of afroamerican culture demands a historian musicologist literary historian sociologist etc the soul of a people must be reflected in the results of the research as well as the life style of the black university we must be in search of the funky sociologist the soulful political scientist and the university president who can get down these are some of the necessary ingredients of a black university and while we can at best look to the future for its full realization it is quite possible now to suggest a structural outline that reflects these fundamental assumptions about its social and intellectual role the diagram on page suggests three related colleges concerned with distinct areas though bound together in the idea of the university each would be organized around research teaching and practice for every part of the university community there would be centers for international study asia africa latin america international conference center an advisory board of community representatives from all walks of life with the task of providing policy suggestions and guidelines this would insure the community of ties to the specific parts of the university as one enters the university he will be faced with a variety of degree programs and alternative courses of study it is quite clear that the standard fouryear college degree meets only a partial need for the afroamerican community but even the student entering the college of liberal arts would have to work at least a year in one or more of the other two colleges in order to meet the requirements for graduation the general principle might well be that to meet the needs of today the new programs will have to take less time but those set up to meet the needs of tomorrow will have to take more time as a national institution engaged in activities found nowhere else the component colleges of the black university would be of great service to a wide variety of groups service professionals working with afroamericans face a challenge supported by sparse research and little experience the college of afroamerican studies being a center of innovation and discovery concerning these problems will conduct special courses and training programs so that students can supplement their training and experience with a concentrated program there is a desperate need for social workers teachers lawyers doctors psychiatrists etc and the same kind of function is planned for the entire university there also must be connected with such a university a set of centers of international study they will be small centers specializing in specific areas in order that together they might constitute an international program without superficially missing the peculiar character of each part of the world in addition no such university could hope to function without an international conference center available to the university community and accommodating other activities consistent with the aims and purpose of the university community and liberation movement afro americans are moving onto the international scene and so must have at their disposal a center where such meetings can be held as stated at the beginning of this discussion there is no panacea for the afroamerican liberation movement just as there can and will be no monolithic organizational structure but there can be operational unity around such concepts as the black university the first step in moving toward this operational unity moving toward the black university is to begin a creative and honest dialogue among afroamericans but more than that we need small bands of people in positions to act to make steps to be daring enough to risk failure or worse irrelevance it will only be when these ideas can be referred to in concrete terms that definitive statements can be made and the concrete reality of the black university must begin today one last thought the afroamerican community does not possess unlimited resources with which to carry on experiment after experiment each of us who can contribute to the black university must ask himself what he is doing for it what he is doing for this kind of operational unity i am calling for all of the brothers and sisters in other colleges and university settines to come on home and to those at home let us get this thing together the black university a practical approach by darwin t turner ost reform ends in revolution perhaps that will be the inevitable result in any effort to reform higher education for negroes in the united states nevertheless before proposing the revolutionary step of establishing a new institutiona black universityi wish to suggest ways of achieving the desired improvement within the present structure of higher education for fear that the very discussion of this issue may seem to provide substance for those hostile critics who argue that negroes are peculiar creatures always demanding or needing special attention i must point out that the need for reform is not limited to the education of negroes higher education in the united states needs attention it is a mongrel conceived from the forced wedding of the european ideal of educating the elite to the united states ideal of educating the masses students complain about their loss of identity their isolation from professors their inability to receive respect as young adults and their subjection to antiquated or absurd academic regulations hp courses and materials teachers complain about the disinterest of students and about the overemphasis on athletics grants and research administrators complain about the continuous complaining by students and teachers although negroes share in these characteristic and perennial problems of higher education negroes experience additional problems both in the integrated colleges and in the predominantly negro colleges the negro teacher in an integrated institution knows that he exists as a visible symbol of liberal attitudes and practices of brotherhood if he is one in a million he may become the chairman of his department or who is there besides john hope franklin if he is especially astute in his studies of negroes he may aspire to be a kenneth b clark most often however he rises to the lowly post of assistant or associate professor and squirms there the channels to prominence are dammed for him even though his intelligence and training may surpass those of men who rise beyond his rank if he works in a predominantly negro college he generally must live in the south professionally his growth is restricted by the cultural isolation the poverty and the apathy frequently characteristic of such institutions because he may become a professor a dean or even a president he may earn more money than he would in an integrated institution psychologically however he struggles to maintain selfrespect when professional friends accuse him of martyrdom or worse even though the quality of instruction in individual classes may equal that observed in any college in the country widely publicized reports by white men have proclaimed the innate inferiority of such institutions thus as long as he remains attached to a predominantly negro college he too is adjudged inferior or at best an exception a smallsized frog in a muddy cesspool it is no wonder that vacillating between such harsh alternatives negro educators frequently dream of a black university in which they might rise to a level ordained by their talents and ambition while commanding the professional respect accorded to teachers at prestige institutions similarly sensitive negro students feel repressed in integrated institutions prospects are brighter for them than for negro teachers they may be elected to such exalted positions as homecoming queen or president of a club or even a class the only requirement is that they be exceptional in intelligence athletic ability charm or beauty or that the school be campaigning to prove its liberality if they are average or enroll during the wrong year they drop into obscurity where they remain far more hidden than are white classmates of equal talent regardless of their prominence they experience restrictions in social life academically some suffer from the prejudice of instructors who believe negroes incapable of swimming above c level still others intelligent students may suspect that they are being crippled by condescending tolerance their answers are accepted too easily their mistakes are forgiven too quickly they fear that they are being hurried along with good grades by teachers willing to evaluate negroes on lowered standards because after graduation the negroes will disappear into their own world where their ignorance will neither injure nor threaten the white world furthermore whether talented or average these students will be taught very little about the worthy achievements of other negroes as students in a predominantly negro college they may achieve more local prominence as individuals but they have read the studies which advise them and the world that their education is inferior this knowledge creates double dangers first although they resent the situation which labels them inferior by association they subconsciously come to accept the judgment consequently they fail to drive themselves as industriously as they would in integrated institutions and too frequently they protest against the teachers who demand collegelevel work from them second because they lack firsthand knowledge of integrated colleges they assume that each weakness which they observe must be unique to predominantly negro colleges and must be further evidence of the inferiority of such institutions like negro teachers they want to be part of an institution which will afford the opportunity to develop their talents and the prestige merited by their achievements let us therefore dream of the ideal institutionone which will give growth to negro teachers and students alike it is i repeat one which can be developed within the current framework of higher educationif it is to be developed at all endowment a university must have money good teachers and good administratorswhether white or black go where salaries will buy all the necessities and hopefully some of the luxuries money is needed for classroom buildings dormitories staff equipment and supplies predominantly negro colleges have lacked money they have depended upon state legislators churches generous patrons alumni and students except in california legislators spend money for education as grudgingly as a temperance worker gives alcoholics money for liquor generally one statesupported university is favored the rest beg the least successful beggars have been the predominantly negro colleges which have lacked alumni who seated in southern legislatures might trade votes for dollars more limited in funds churches frequently have doled their allotments with the prayer that sacrifice and dedication might substitute for cash donorsboth individuals and foundationshave been generous at times but planning a black university one cannot afford to forget that the majority of philanthropic supporters of negroes higher education are white negro alumni have contributed but deficient in both number and wealth they generally have been unable to provide more than a few scholarships and some spending change tuition has been an important source of revenue but it is a troublesome source raise tuition too high fewer students attend increase the number of students additional money is needed for teachers equipment supplies and facilities furthermore the quality of the student too frequently is lowered when additional quantity is sought an obvious method to use to secure the necessary money would be an appeal to the negro populace to support a worthy cause an average contribution of one dollar for every negro in the united states would furnish working capitalsixteen or seventeen million dollars but will enough negroes contribute sufficiently generously to a single university i fear pessimistically that this ideal institution must continue to depend partially upon contributions from white patronsfederal or private who traditionally weaken in generosity as a negro institution gains in affluence of course in a black state or a black nation it would be possible to secure sufficient money by a minimal tax but i must make clear that i am not considering a black state or nation on the continent of north america although i would be happy to be part of a nation where a black man might be elected president in i do not judge such a nation to be practicable in north america where it would begin years behind the other countries where its creation would require uprooting settled people and where its existence might depend upon consciencecontributions from people notoriously untroubled by conscience when comfort and cash are at stake no i must discuss the possibilities of an ideal institution for negroes within the united states to secure sufficient money such an institution must discover a way to tap the pocketbooks of moneyed negroes as no other negro cause has succeeded in doing all methods must be usedcollections in churches dances by fraternal organizations door to door soliciting telephone and mail canvassing raffles and the solicitors must have substantial arguments to offset the prejudice against higher education the disinterest in national causes and the suspicion of solicitors i curricula in considering second the question of what the negro student should learn i am merely giving high priority to the complaint of negro students that they learn too little about themselves and about ways to improve their community although i admit the justice of the charge i cannot blame anyone except negro faculty membersmyself included unimaginatively we like thousands of white educators have reproduced for our students the same education which we received we have wanted our students to possess the kind of knowledge respected by the semiintegrated society which will surround them after graduation but we have failed to realize sufficiently the need to provide them with additional knowledge required for the segregated society the black society the little circle inside of and ignored bythe large circle we can blame ourselves nothingto my knowledgeprevents predominantly negro colleges from offering any course that is desired i am fully aware that some southern legislators or governors have applied pressure to some negro college presidents in an effort to curb demonstrations i know also that some negro college presidents have succumbed to such pressure or timidly have restricted student activity in anticipation of such pressure certainly having taught in north carolina for nine years i know how legislators may try to restrict freedom of speech fearful of communism the legislature of north carolina banned from appearance on campuses any acknowledged communist or anyone who had pleaded the fifth amendment educators in north carolina understood however that this law was not aimed at the predominantly negro colleges the white legislators scarcely knew nor cared who spoke to the negro students the legislators and their constituents concerned themselves with the speakers who came to the campuses of the large statesupported universities i do not know any instance in which a state official has opposed an attempt to introduce any raciallyoriented course at a predominantly negro college of course i have no primary knowledge of what happens in education in mississippi or alabama those bastions of confederate racism i do know teachers in those states however and have no reason to believe that courses have been denied the fact is that negro educators and i must include myself have not conceived courses oriented to the negro aside from the history of the negro in america a course in literature by negro american writers and possibly a course or two in sociology including a discussion of the problems of minority groups few educators have proposed courses studying the achievements of black men i know no course in the history of art or music of negroes no history of education which includes a study of predominantly negro segregated public schools and colleges no linguistics course which analyzes the socalled negro dialect there should be sociology courses analyzing the structure of the negro community business courses describing methods of organizing cooperative community businesses more courses concentrated on practices in small businesses these courses are desirable can be established and must be established even at the predominantly negro colleges as currently structured the irony is that they may be established first and condescendingly at predominantly white institutions this new information however cannot be substituted for other more traditional knowledge it must be additional i hesitate to use the term supplementary only because some readers may assume that i regard it as less important to the contrary it is significant however if the negro student is provided only with knowledge about negroes then his education will be as restricted as it has been in the past his vision true will be black instead of white but the revisers of the curriculum will be guilty of the same colorblindness and narrow vision for which they condemn the planners of the present curriculum research despite the extravagances committed in its name research is the consort of good teaching a teacher must have information about his subject before significant changes can be made in curricula for negro students considerable research will be needed for shamefully facts about negroes are not known or have been gathered by white researchers too frequently in quickly published studies where a limited sampling was used to substantiate a preconceived generalization about an entire population just as predominantly negro colleges have been compared unfavorably with the ideal of a college or with the prestige institutions rather than with predominantly white colleges of comparable size and endowment so negroes as individuals and groups have been evaluated against the ideal rather than judged in comparison with white peers of similar economic educational and social background new research is needed extensive research is needed there are negroes qualified to perform such research but ways must be devised to provide researchers with the time needed and to persuade foundations to trust negro researchers to conduct scholarly studies of negroes without such research the new courses cannot be offered for it is better to teach nothing than to teach something which is known to be merely a guess f m publishing the black university needs to publish the research of its scholars today white publishers respect research into problems of negroes primarily when it is conducted by white men a negro scholar faculty curriculum research by stephen e henderson s i see it the black university may exist in the following forms as a new institution as an institution already existing in toto and as an institution already existing in part both physically and intellectually now it strikes me that the first choice for practical men is unrealistic and wasteful since the need is immediate and the founding and supporting of a strong institution so costly and timeconsuming that it would unduly diffuse the already too meager financial and professional resources of the black community can we turn then to a black university which already exists in toto the question of course is rhetorical for if one such institution existed there would be no need for a discussion of the desirabilitv of such an insti or tution this consequently leaves us with the third possibility an institution already existing in part physically and intellectually it appears to me that although the black university does not at present exist anywhere in toto it does exist in part in that residue of blacknesssocial cultural and philosophicalwhich is found in the socalled predominantly negro colleges or to use another circumlocution in the historically negro colleges the problem becomes then a matter of modifying some one or more of these institutions personally i have no doubt that such modification is necessary indeed it seems to me inevitable some perhaps many of these schools will survive with relatively little change others will perish either absorbed into their various state budgets or through consolidation or through absorption into the cloudy american mainstream strangely enough this lastnamed fate seems to be eagerly anticipated by many institutions which with few exceptions have sizeable white numbers in their faculties but virtually no white students in their enrollment riesman and jencks have already analyzed this phenomenon so i am content to observe that schools are for the education of students not for the employment of teachers once we accept that simple fact the pathetic absurdity of calling our schools predominantly negro becomes altogether too clear it indicates a curious ambivalence which is characteristic of all of our relationships with the rest of the country we say predominantly negro meaning perhaps that this is a temporary situation that what we really want is to be integrated ie to be a minorityin our own schools why is it that we doubt our own capacity to give our children a quality education or even to raise our children at all that same ambivalence lurks behind the whole thrust of the recent civil_rights movement another aspect of this ambivalence is perhaps the secret wish to retain the schools as predominantly negro ie to retain power and control and decisionmaking in our own hands if that is what we mean then why do we apologize for it god knows its natural enough and its a salutary develop ment to see as a practical expression of black consciousness that parents and teachers and pupils in northern urban high schools are demanding just that kind of control if such a desire is natural then why do the negro colleges equivocate i submit that they do so out of confusion or out of fearconfusion as to their role in a society marked by constant crisis confusion as to the nature of the changes taking place in that society fear of offending their white supporters and faculty and fear of reevaluating the premises on which the institutions themselves are predicated by nature of the problem to which i address myself the schools which best illustrate this anxiety are our socalled liberal arts colleges they represent the heart of the problem since their ultimate function is to shape the students mind and soul in such a way that he can perform most efficiently and happily in his world glancing at random through statements of institutional purpose of many of the schools one discovers quite soon that the purpose actually if stated in fashionable language is to help the student discover his identity through acquainting him with the history the culture and the forms of belief of western civilization even this limited aim has never been carried out on any large scale and it hasnt been done chiefly because as educators we took the passive role and assumed that the experience of blackness is irrelevant to western history and civilization and hence to our students and our own search for identity the single revolutionary concept that has emerged in recent years is that the black experience is not only relevant in such a search it is fundamental and crucial one might almost call it archetypal for from it can be derived not only americas quest for selfhood but indeedsince the black experience is also the type of the colonial experience and reaction to itthe whole modern experience of europe as well how absurd it is then to assume as some critics do that a black university would exist in a vacuum when the question of identitythe question of blacknessis more than a matter of pigmentation when it is ultimately a moral and philosophical position in other words one finally wills to be black this is what the fuss is all aboutalbert cleage adam powell walter white frank silvera willed in varying degrees to be black my firm belief is that by willing to be black in that philosophical sense our schools can make a greater contribution to our personal wellbeing and to the world at large than by any other means that i can presently see what does this willtoblackness entail it entails a certain double vision not the double vision of du bois but a shift in perspective in which one looks inward into himself and the group and sees outward with sharper msight in which one looks backward into his history and his cultural roots and discovers that he is looking forward it is like looking backward in time though one is looking forward in space through a telescope if through this process one discovered god in the actual act of creation and with a new physics we might ones knowledge would be complete vaughan the poet said there is in god they say a deep and dazzling darkness and it is for the reason of this liberating god within us that we must confront our blackness immediately we must confront it because we have to no inconsiderable extent africanized this country that time it was unconscious and passive this time it must be otherwise for unless the values inherent in soul and negritude are made to prevail in this country we may yet find ourselves at armageddon across the seas in our skies and in our own city streets assuming then my estimate of the importance of the black university to be valid i shall briefly discuss what seems to me the feasibility of such an institution first if black college presidents willed to be black the problem would be very much simpler though by no means simple for to some extent philosophical blackness or soul exists in all of our institutionsif not in individual courses then in faculty or students our immediate problem thus is to bring this blackness as it were to a saturation point this means conscious reorganization and concentration of human and other resources preferably as i see it in several regional centers which already exist in the baltimored c area in the norfolk area in the durhamgreensboro area in the nashville area in the atlanta area in the tallahassee area in the new orleans area and in the houston area depending on the degree of cooperation they would become centers of black consciousness or units of a single de facto suprainstitutional black university the simplest thing to do of course would be for college presidents to recognize the schizophrenia implicit in being predominantly negro and simply declare themselves to be black people working especially for the good of black people though excluding no one because of color or ethnic origin their mission being to capitalize on the unique importance of the black experience to this country and to the world if we were honest with ourselves and if national spokesmen for cultural pluralism were serious then presi dents would have no fear of losing financial and moral support indeed the federal government and private industry in such a case should have no qualms at all about paying some interest on that great invisible national debt the vast backlog of salary which they owe us for almost years of economic exploitation but this is too much to hope for and too naive since recent pronouncements by some of our presidents indicate their determination to die the white death while others indicate an unfortunate confusion of a personal revulsion for extremes of pigmentation with the legitimate concern which black students have with the ultimate purpose of liberal educationfreedom through selfknowledge the recourse then must lie in the willtoblackness of the faculty and the students when this will becomes strong enough when it becomes informed in all senses of the word with soul when it reaches the saturation point or better still when it reaches critical mass it will demand institutional restructuringin faculty in general resources and in acknowledged aims some of these changes may take place comparatively rapidly and thoroughly in a few strategic institutions in others they may not occur at all in some to pursue a figure the energy will be harnessed for the good of all in others the result may well be destructive social explosion that the resistance is formidable is obvious to anyone who reads the newspapers that the change will come is equally obvious to all but the blind and the deaf who really have no business at all in the crucial task of educating this new black generation who well may be our last hope for sanity and decency in this country some of the changes i speak of may occur through the following structures regional organization shared resources systematic and continual faculty and student exchange and black humanists and specialists in blackness by regional organization i mean several things the first is the establishment of honest and creative relationships with nonacademic black intellectual communities i mean the establishment of new and respectable relationships with the black nonintellectual communities i mean the establishment of genuine lines of communication between academic institutions in the same region that is exchange below the administrative level this type of organization is admittedly difficult but models do exist the atlanta university center is moving in this direction from this type of regional reorganization could come more concrete objectives shared resources both general and human let us take an example of each first the general by this i mean nonhuman resources such as library holdings art collections and the like i submit that the average black student has no real notion of the richness of the fisk negroana collection or the howard library or the atlanta university negro collections of books manuscripts and paintings fewer students still know anything of the schomberg collection and honesty compels me to say that altogether too few professors know very much about these collections whose fault is it our own but fortunately structures already exist which could make it possible for even the smallest the poorest negro college to will itself to a saving state of blackness as i have suggested its contours above if a panel of artists and critics comparable to the one which set up the recent exhibit of afroamerican painting at city college new york could cull the best and the most representative examples of african and afroamerican art which our colleges possess it should be a relatively simple matter to make slides and reproductions available at a nominal fee even to these colleges both it seems to me lie within the possibility of a title iii grant manuscript material and other comparatively rare items could be made available on microfilm with provisions made for printouts this is just an obvious example a more thorough going proposition would be the establishment of an information retrieval system connected with the regional resources of our best schools and even with the special resources of the nations largest graduate schools i see the irony in this latter statement but what do you do at a black university if someone else has your ancestral artifactsraid the british museum ultimately the purpose of such a system would be to stimulate students and faculty alike to visit the institutions where the originals exist this brings us to the next point human resources these resources are naturally faculty and students the problem of course is to get them together on a meaningful basis across institutional lines now some few students and faculty might be stimulated enough or may have the financial resources to visit schools with special library or art holdings but this is not enough what is needed it seems to me is some plan whereby a continual interchange of ideas and opinions may be insured on a personal facetoface basis this can be done by a system of student exchange between centers of blackness and negro colleges oddly enough a good deal of this was done a few years ago only the exchange was in effect between centers of whiteness and negro colleges i remember a boy from the midwest who left after a few days on my campus suffering i was told from culture shock obviously such a system can work only if the administration of the negro school is sympathetic or apathetic it remains for students and faculty to will the change to create the structure at any rate the visits could last anywhere from a weekend to a semester depending on the academic standards of the institution and other such sticky business a visitation period of a semester would presuppose that the student would find something worth his time in one of the regional black centers what he should find is a group of gifted black humanists who have assembled or have been assembled at a center for the express purposes of the black university as stated above presumably at first there wouldnt be enough of these people to staff all of the schools which may require them presumably some of the schools may not be able to afford to pay them and one couldnt expect them to starve black starvation is still starvation no matter how soulful still it would be possible especially for the politically aggressive and the academically and artistically talented for a sizeable number of students no matter how poor to be brought into dialogue with this group of dedicated and gifted teachers the student might even spend time in two or more such situations obtaining the kind of experience the black university and its community by j herman blake order to become a viable institution and to make a meaningful contribution to the black community the black university must be cognizant of the varied and complex developments among black people these developments should become an explicit part of course offerings in an effort to develop a philosophy and ideology which will permit us to analyze and evaluate social change in the black community from a perspective of blackness the decade of the s will certainly go down in history as one in which major contradictory trends developed in black communities across the nation this is the decade that has seen black people achieve higher political offices than ever before two of the nations major cities have elected black men as mayors another black man was elected as senator from a new england state a black man sits on the cabinet of the president and another black man sits on the supreme court all of these are dramatic and significant firsts for black people in the sixties and they portend further changes with these developments have come other phenomena which indicate the perplexing and troubled situation within black communities for this is also the first decade to see major urban insurrection for four consecutive summers with the most recent outbursts far more severe than any previous ones this is the decade that has seen more and more black militants take up the philosophy of selfdefense when attacked viewing violent action as an effective approach to black dignity and manhood this is the decade that has seen more and more black youth refusing to serve in the armed forces of the united states on the grounds that the nation is engaged in a program of genocide against black people in other lands and within its own confines the nation is also practicing genocide against blacks these contradictory trends amongst black people in americaon the one hand some black men getting more rewards for participating in the system and on the other hand black men refusing to participate regardless of the rewardsmust be taken into consideration by a black university for the contradiction requires some resolution in this paper we shall review several recent and major demographic trends in the black community to shed some light upon some of the underlying variables in this perplexing situation there are a variety of ways in which these changes can be analyzed but we choose to focus upon two general approaches where we were at the beginning of the decade or an earlier point as compared to where we are now and the relative changes in the black and white communities and where these changes leave us in relation to those who so utterly fail to understand our condition the varieties of variables that one might select the different statistical measures that might be applied and the different base populations or starting points make it easy to prove any point one wishes to prove about the black community we hope to avoid this problem in some instances notably income by presenting several measures to show the trends in the black communitv one of the most significant twentiethcentury trends among black people has been the redistribution of the population from the country to the city and out of the south to the north and west this trend has continued into the sixties between and the proportion of black people in the south declined from to percent we should not ignore the fact however that despite a vast migratory trend the majority of the black people still live in the south and blacks make up onefifth of the total population in the southern states in addition to the movement out of the south black people have been moving into cities and the large ones at that in both north and south the recent appointment of a black mayor in washington d c and the election of black men to mayoralties in gary and cleveland is a direct manifestation of the presence of large black populations in these cities over half percent of all black people now live in the central cities of metropolitan areas and the population increase has been fastest in the largest cities in metropolitan areas with one million or more persons black people comprise onefourth of the central city population and the experts estimate that in black people were at least percent or more of the population of of the largest cities in the country these cities and the proportions of their population which are black are as follows washington newark atlanta new orleans memphis baltimore st louis cleveland detroit philadelphia chicago the evidence indicates that more black people than ever before are both interested in education and are taking advantage of every opportunity to increase their knowledge the statistics on the proportions of blacks completing high school and college show some interesting and significant trends in percent of all black males and percent of all black females between the ages of had completed high school however by percent of all black males and percent of all black females in the same age category had completed high school not only was there a dramatic increase in the proportion of young adults with high school diplomas the number of young males completing high school now exceeds the number of young females although the proportions are much lower the same trend holds for those completing college in percent of all black males between the ages of and and percent of all black females had completed four or more years of college by these proportions had increased to percent for males and percent for females if the dramatic increase in high school completions is any indicator we can expect substantial improvements in the number of black youth with college degrees in the next few years it is not at all insignificant in considering a black university to recognize that the educational experience of black youth still takes place in predominantly black schools where the culture of black people is maintained in the inter action of the youth if not in the educational curriculum sixtysix percent of all black youths in the twelfth grade in were in schools which were predominantly black so these youth would probably be more comfortable and at ease in black institutions of higher education despite the movement into cities where occupational opportunity is said to be higher despite higher levels of education the employment situation of black people has changed little from the last hired first fired status since the early fifties the unemployment rate for black people has been about twice as high as that for whites and it has remained this way until the present day although unemployment rates have fluctuated considerably in the unemployment rate for black people went up to percent the highest since but it has dropped steadily in subsequent years it went down to percent in and the decline continued to percent for the first nine months of black people are overrepresented in every category of unemployment during the first nine months of blacks comprised percent of the civilian labor force but were percent of all unemployed workers and percent of those persons unemployed for at least three and a half consecutive months teenagers still suffer the most of those without jobs for in the first part of the unemployment rate for black youth between and was percent more than twice the rate for white youth between and there were substantial increases in the number of black people holding white collar positions and less dramatic but still increases for blacks holding blue collar positions the increase in white collar employment shows the largest gain in clerical and sales positions blacks are still underrepresented in the skilled white collar positions as of with the situation for black males and black females showing some significant differences in professional and technical positions black males represent percent as many as there would be if there were full occupational equality while females in the same category represent percent as many as would be found in a situation of full equality on the other hand in the clerical positions black males represent percent as many as would be found in a situation of full equality while black females comprise only percent these and other data which we have analyzed indicate that the black female has a better chance of obtaining a job consistent with her education and training than the black male in the professional technical and managerial categories while black males are more likely than females to be adequately represented in clerical positions the chronic problems black people face with education employment and occupational levels are reflected in the income levels of the population although the sixties have seen changes in income for blacks there are varying interpretations of income changes in the black community and they produce different conclusions some analysts talk about the income of families while others talk about the income of persons and then differentiate between males and females furthermore income changes can be analyzed in terms of the percentage change in median income the ratio of black to white median income or the absolute blackwhite differences in income let us see how the black situation in the sixties stands up in terms of all these measurements in percent of all black families had incomes under per year percent of all white families were at this level but by this had declined to percent of all families percent for whites the proportion of black families with incomes between and went up from to percent white families declined from to percent between and black families with incomes over went up from to percent in the same period of time with a corresponding increase from to percent for white families these figures are ad rsity by vincent harding ne of the most insistent themes in the literature of black america is the attempt to articulate our awareness of the presence of a certain dividedness in our deepest beings an inner tension which w e b du bois referred to as a twoness of spirit and soul while all americans even those who were here when the others came half a millennia ago are people of a broken past nowhere is the tension so often obvious as within the afroamerican community we are the largest single segment of the nation which holds within itself both east and west both africa and america both developed and developing societies for many of us the tension has been so unbearably painful that we have collapsed it on one or the other side until recently it was more often the western developed side which triumphed now of course there moves among us a renewed consciousness of our nonwesternness and in the ghettos of the land one easily senses that many black men are seeking to build and celebrate a newold nation in the midst of the worlds most developed society any university which grew with integrity out of the ground of our black experience in america would have to reflect and bear the creative agony of that tensionno matter how great the temptation to escape it the life of such an institution would in many ways testify to the westernization of our lives but if it is to make a major contribution to its students and their world the western experience cannot be its most important emphasis more than colleges and universities in this country and hundreds more in europe already perform that task though predominantly negro institutions have long imitated such a direction those of us who seek to build faithfully out of the materials of the afroamerican experience are called to other paths one major strength of a black university would be its internanationalism but its focus would not follow the style of the scores of international studies programs which have burgeoned in american institutions since the korean war instead the uniqueness of our approach to the world would be found in our vision through an unashamedly blackoriented prism in the academic program and in a hundred other less structured ways the black university would seek to explore celebrate and record the experiences of the nonwestern world because of much that we have lived through our focus would be upon that segment of the nonwest which has existed under western domination for the relatively brief span of years or less and which now shakes the world with its efforts to wrench free even within that group our specialty would rightfully be found among the peoples of africa both those who remained on the continent and those who were forced into the new world through the diaspora of slavery this in a peculiar way is our thing and we would have no less reason to build on it in a university setting than brandeis has for building on jewish studies or minnesota on immigrant studies or oklahoma on studies of the american indian in an article of this length it is possible only to suggest some of the directions such a blackoriented internationalism might take in a university context but certain lines are suggestive of the whole in the academic program one of the most attractive aspects of this focus would be comparative intercultural studies of many kinds especially in the humanities and the social sciences for instance in music we would try to develop an understanding of the continuities and discontinuities among the musical styles of africa and those of its scattered children in the northern and southern portions of the black new world the dance and the drama would present obvious analogues for possible study we would also attempt to explore the implications of the strong similarities which a noted literary authority claims he has found in the literature recently coming out of harlem and out of black johannesburg what fascinating insights might courses in comparative black literature produce when we realize that there are sections of cuba and other parts of latin america where african religious practices are alive and prospering it is obvious that the study of comparative religious development is also filled with new possibilities in such a context especially as those who know black folk religion in the united states remind us of the persistent presence of a belief in religious magic here or it may be that in such a setting careful elaboration would be done on a significant interdisciplinary as well as intercultural academic monograph such as lanternaris the religions of the oppressed for here in a study of the messianic movements of the nonwestern world it is clear that history political science sociology psychology and religion encounter and enrich each other few settings would be more congenial to such mutual intellectual fertilization than the kind of institution we envision indeed such a study as lanternaris strongly suggests that the blackoriented university could present a marvelous opportunity for the social sciences in america to break out of their nationalistic trap sociology might include such matters as urban development among black people in nairobi chicago and rio political science could well analyse the forms of resistance to colonial domination in harlem cuba mozambique and vietnam so too might specialists in education try to understand the ways in which indians africans and afroamericans have attempted to rescue their educational systems from the domination of structures and ideologies shaped in england france and white america seminars in nonwestern cultural nationalisms of the modern world might be filled with excitement and profit for those who are trying to discern develop and sustain an afroamerican style of life the academic curriculum would be of course only one of the places in which the unique internationalism of the black university might be expressed special institutes on afroamerican using american in the hemispheric sense culture would abound colloquies on a subject like slavery would engage scholars from all over the new world especially those who still bear the marks which were first painfully known by their ancestors conferences on such topics as the role of women in reemerging societies would simply be part of the breathing of such a school symposia on strategies for social change in the former colonial societies would be sponsoredbut not by the american state department think tanks filled with the varied but constant experience of blackness might be established for the sole purpose of analyzing specific conflict situations from detroit to angola and beyond and suggesting directions of actions and ideology for those who are struggling to break away from the hegemony of the west from such a university there would go out teams of specialists in development whose primary concerns would not include the opening of wedges for american influences rather their search would be for ways in which modernization might be purged of its synonymous relationship with westernization and americanization throughout the black university and in all of its special projects the emphasis would be on the search for new models for new systems for new ways of life free from the suffocating grasp of the most current forms of imperialism not only would specialists be sent out in such a search but other kinds of specialists would be brought in representatives of the anticolonial forces members of liberation fronts religious and educational leaders from the re borning nations would be invited and welcomed in order to give deeper meaning to the searching indeed such a university might well become a sanctuary of sorts for some of the worlds revolutionaries what better way to raise the hard questions which many revolutions often force honest intellectuals to ask such an institution would selfconsciously be orienting its students toward an understanding of and an appreciation forthe myriad ways in which our experiences here as colonials who were brought to the mother country parallel those of our brothers who had to receive the emissaries of countless white fatherlands it would of course also stress the uniqueness of the afroamerican colonial experience as a part of developing this sense of common experienceand common roots summer study and junior years abroad in europe would likely become the exception and black students would move toward latin america africa india and asia for their experience of intercultural exchange and overseas study this direction would of course have significant implications for the languages taught in the institution german for instance might have difficulties both student and faculty exchanges with the nonwestern world would become a regular part of the black universitys life the journal of such a center might well seek to ally itself with the new world publication of the caribbean with presence africaine and with other lesser known publications of the nonwestern intellectuals the university would be serviceoriented in the largest sense of that term it would set up skills banks for developing nations and it would urge those students who do not return to the black american communities to offer their skills in africa latin america and wherever else they are needed and desired conceivably a blackoriented overseas service corps might develop and this would not only provide excellent nationbuilding opportunities but it could become an alternative to action with the united states military forces for it is likely that the international orientation of a black university will create many dissenters to the foreign policy which our armed forces now enforce should it refuse to enter the lists of american foreign policy supporters should it become a significant source of dissent and the center of a search for new ways of international life it is not easy to know how the black university would be funded indeed if it saw reason to move beyond experiments in nationbuilding to the search for a new world society in which nations played a far less significant role its enemies might come from the nationalistic left as well as the right certain monies would not be available others like some connected with black chicago slums or african diamond mining might not be accepted a free black university might be forced into existence for the present that is the problem of other writers and other moments at this moment it may suffice to say that the black university must seek to be faithful to the best dreams of our greatest twentieth century black dreamers from du bois to frantz fanon it should at least attempt to place the rise of the west in proper historical perspective refusing either to do homage toor to be terrified bywhat may well prove to be no more than a hyperactive aberration in the context of mankinds long essentially nonwestern pilgrimage such a service to truth would be no mean accomplishment in itself nevertheless to speak of fanon is to suggest even more for it may be that in its international aspects such an institution might well take as its fiercely driving theme the call of his last chapter in the wretched of the earth there his words were a call out of the darkness of hopeless cynical reaction on the one hand and out of ersatz brightness of imitative european styles on the other it was a call to the lightfilled sometimes blinding gruelling search for new shapes and forms for patterns which deal wisely with the longer lines of history and the deepest needs of men ultimately of course he urged for europe for ourselves and for humanity comrades we must turn over a new leaf we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new man as such his call is heir to all the pitfalls of messianism at most and to the disillusions of aborted hope at least nevertheless it may well be far better that a university should search and reach and possibly fail at the practice of such hope than that it sell out to the highest bidder and live on in the style to which america has accustomed us if it is better to try to do our thing then let us press on towards the black university a by nathan hare oward uni versiv t ty spreads like a il i complex of cancerous sores on a breastlike m hill in the heart of one of the worst sectionsby most criteriaof the district of columbia the university which is drably cached in subdued majesty midway the census tracts heaviest in social disorganization was founded in hypocritical contradiction by an ambivalent general oliver otis howard apparently a godfearing religious fanatic who forewent his ambition to become a minister later a lawyer to gain power through military might and position my office during my first three years as a professor at howard was in a third floor corner of what once was general howards mansion on the campus from there i could see the washington monument and the capitol building just beyond the squalor of washingtons ghetto on the way to the office each day i passed through the confusion and anguish of students waiting in the building to gain admission to the counseling center where their educational fates would be dictated to them by hostile clerks hoping somehow to piece together the debris from overly zealous administrative decrees today viewing howard from a distance of more than a mile yet from the vantage point of an intimate exposure to its inner workings i am able to watch it writhe and quiver caught in the contlict between the new surge for black equality and the deathbed contortions of white supremacy and oppression it is a condition i have known first hand for more than six years and have studied thoroughly with the combined tools of the sociologist and the journalist i learned that howard university which acquired its first set of buildings illegally and became a monument to general o howard and his scheme has never broken entirely free from the grips of a militaryreligiouspolitical corruption with this influence criticized also by the great frederick douglass a colored member of the board of trustees who described the ring as hungry sharks with professions of piety upon their lips there developed in the words of john mercer langston who eventually resigned in protest from his position as dean of the law school the entire law school faculty with himbefore going on to become the first negro ever elected to public office in the united states appeared and grew the feeling that the negro whether as trusteee or member of the faculty is of small account indeed rather a pest only as he serves to give color to the enterprise and with this feeling has constantly grown the idea that the colored youth attending the university are incapable of high intellectual achievement still by the university which opened in with an allwhite faculty and student body had a student body onehalf of one per cent white and a faculty less than nine per cent white today the graduate and professional schools notable in the medical professions where white rejects from white schools frequently have high enough scores to outdistance poorly trained black applicants are fast developing a white majority and this is also the trend for the liberal arts faculty where the average salary is higher for white professors than for black professors at the same rank just prior to the emergence of this trend as howard became the capstone of negro education it also became an epitome of political docility and academic nothingness groveling at the feet of outside mainly government expectations real or imagined and fawning upon white congressional appropriators however in an era of greater access to white colleges and rising negro expectations this footshuffling was proving inadequate as the centennial year approached in the competition for top students and professors faced with this predicament administrators merely intensified their stepin fetchit tactics then in september president james nabrit announced in the washington post a plan to make howard sixty per cent white by a plan opposed by virtually every student on campus to accomplish this goal the university had devised an ingenious program for excluding or and removing black students while attracting white ones some professors were warned by the deans office through departmental chairmen instructed to counsel them that their grade distributions should approximate a normal distribution regardless of the caliber of a given class and specifically should include a minimum of failing marks at the same time it was decided to raise standards by raising by points the required score on entrance tests standardized on children of urban middleclass white exposure many culturally deprived black students would not of course be expected to manage such a score white students who flunked would not need to humiliate themselves enrolling in a precollege sequence at howard hence a proposed special division for students who fail the test would invariably be black these subnormals would have to spend a year preparing to enter the new white howard having failed the test as individuals their selfesteem would further be decimated for they would be set apart as failures and subjected to an egomortifying curriculum first they were to receive a speech course already incorporated at howard frankly calcu lated to force black students to lose their ingroup dialects despite the fact that president nabrit himself has been successful in supreme court presentations in a classical negro dialect such students also were to be given a course in reading skills and simultaneously one in masterpieces of world literature it goes without saying that masterpiece authors would be invariably if not exclusively caucasian still another course was history of western civilization not world civilization as in the case of the masterpieces this curriculum would say to black students who already were failures as individuals that they had no ennobling ancestral roots their kind had produced no civilization worthy of attention no literary achievements and indeed are guilty now of the wrong mode of speech it is true even now at howard within the normal curriculum that a liberal arts student cannot take a course in negro history unless he is a history major anyway i wrote a letter mocking the idea of the whitewash program and the letter appeared in the hilltop the campus newspaper the first issue in september of the centennial year immediately i came under pressure losing first a promotion to chairman of the division of social sciences and other privileges which publicly had been promised me and this was an early object lesson of relentless pressure including subjection to a network of student and faculty spies one day toward the end of september while discussing the effects of urbanization on social norms i criticized the obsolescence of some professed codes of sexual conduct then as if to salvage the class from its shock gave assurances of my abiding adherence to them i told of my efforts the previous year to launch an association of virgins on the campus and that one member grew sick and dropped out and the other flunked out i also explained that the reason howards wall clocks always differed as to time of day was because every time a virgin at howard passes a clock the clock stands still within minutes after that class was over the chairman of my department was calling me in excitedly to say that the dean had said that a student had said that had said that i was the only virgin on howards campus the superiors then proposed to observe my classes and when i refused this unique attention threatened to fire me but backed down when i remarked during the hearing that i had once been the best cottonpicker in creek county oklahoma and that should it ever come to that i could always burn my doctorate and go back to picking cotton after the hearing they sent a letter reappointing me mainly because as they later said in court they feared student disruptions should they fire me during the school year but they nonetheless persisted in threats and harassment warning that if i did not fall in line there was going to be a war late one evening after a heated confrontation with a superior ducked into a middleclass bar near the campus where i encountered a number of older professors their plights surprised and horrified me i decided from then on that if there was going to be a war then i was a soldier and should act like one meanwhile students had been staging protests for grievances which typify universities everywhereagainst curfew regulations and other aspects of the right not to be treated as children the law school students were prominent here led chiefly by jay greene later expelled and now on scholarship in the yale law school and art goldberg a jewish student from berkeley now in rutgers law school their activities consisted mainly of rallies where jay greene and other students would rap to a crowd of several hundred then read resolutions drawn up in legal language and the crowd after being told that the resolutions were to be delivered to president nabrit would joyfully clap their hands and disperse nabrit practically never acted on the resolutions except for a few faint promises even when he was on campus but the procedure was always repeated anyway simultaneously there arose a hybrid political partyprotest group called the student rights oragnization inspired in part by art and jay i accepted the invitation to be its faculty advisor sros membership covered the political waterfront their leaders mainly the editors and feature writers on the hilltop staffwhich later was to prove invaluable regarded themselves as black militants in the responsible sense of the category and had as their heroes the national leaders of sncc though their own style approximated more the style of national core when un ambassador to the un arthur goldberg exboss of nabrit came to howard sro staged a walkout in which i was able to persuade five other professorsall white of courseto take an active part shortly after that some sro members dissatisfied with the moderation of its leaders came to me late february by now with a plan to form a black_power committee they were all freshmen largely unknown on campus except in their dormitories and among their classmates and accordingly asked my aid in composing and reading at a press conference a sort of black university manifesto we called for the complete revamping of negro colleges as they now exist spoke against the emerging desire to make negro colleges predominantly white and generally setting forth a program for transforming negro colleges into black universities with relevance to the black community and its struggle against white racism and imperialism cultural or otherwise this kicked off an onslaught of student demonstrations with now and again some faculty participation and the first real confrontation between howard students and an oppressive administration a rumor grew prevalent on campus that i was going to be eased out in the summer and by midapril it had slipped into television and radio broadcasts one night on the way to my population class i encountered a number of students who inquired anxiously whether the rumor was true i assured them that no such word had come down to me and that the deadline for nonrenewal of twoyear contracts december already had passed inside the classroom i sensed the downcast spirit of the students brought up the rumor and suggested that if there was a howard in september i would very well be there all at once they burst into applause but i knew even then that probably i was passing through my last days at howard and perhaps as a college professor anywhere student uprisings rocked on including a confrontation with a police riot squad behind a girls dormitory the sponsorship of a black is best lecture by heavyweight champ muhammad ali after the administration closed down the auditorium leroi jones in a reading to frequent applause of some of his cathartic poetry on the steps of the school of religion the breaking up of a hearing in which naturallook homecoming queen robin gregory was being tried ostensibly because she had helped me and student huey labrie read the black_power committees manifesto and the interruption of selective service boss general hersheys speech eventually students hanged hershey nabrit and dean frank snowden in effigy and followed this with a successful boycott of classes curiously planned for one day only and reportedly representing efforts on the part of moderate student leaders to grab the protest ball from the black_power committee by now we were nearing final exams and it was decided to wrap up protest until the following fall although a series of six mysterious fires which may or may not have been connected with student activities broke out on campus during the last week or so of school one of them causing a general emptying of the administration building school closed and in the dead of early summer about students and six professors received registered letters of dismissal the manner of selecting the victims was indicative of the general confusion hysteria and inefficiency of the adminstrators who held several private meetings with student spies and faculty informants there were no hearings for dismissed faculty members or students amounting to a direct denial of due process and the chance to confront accusers violating the first and fifth amendments of the constitution of the united states true some middlelevel administrators including clyde ferguson dean of the law school and frank snowden dean of the college of liberal arts went on record as opposing the dismissals dean snowden who reluctantly signed the letters dismissing the professors and who up to that time had risen from one of the favorite howard professors of the late forties to the most hated administrator wrote two letters both prior to the close of school opposing the dismissals one of dean snowdens letters to acting president wormley pleaded in part serious anxiety will arise among other faculty members as to the good faith of the university i believe that the whole matter should be reconsidered before any announcements are made because there seems to me to be a strong possibility that the contemplated action may result not only in serious harm to the universitys position in the academic community but also in creating obstacles for our recruitment of faculty in the future more obnoxious by anybodys the man who cried i am i have often said before to the point of repetition cramps criticism of writine by afroamericans is and should bethe responsibility of afroamerican critics not that black critics are more perspective or analytical or for that matter better writers of criticism but white critics have not in the past as in the present been able to explain or translate black literature accurately this is not heresy but fact and the few reviews that were written by whites of john a williams the man who cried l am little brown support this statement explicitly most good fiction borders on truth iey it is a reflection of the truth if newark and detroit of had not happened one could have in all likelihood read mr williams book with less fear and indeed could have smiled at the uncommon ending one could have contentedly put the book aside as an excellent work of fiction and of course recommended it to friends and associates you know like we recommended the stranger portrait of the artist as a young man black boy et cetera et cetera one could have suggested this book with the same ease and delight as one suggested the early john coltrane however the summer of was not fiction therefore it added a new dimension to this novel the dimension of prophesy as with black music black literature continues to grow extend and ceases to be invisible our literature now cuts and you do bleed mr williams latest book is this type of work a blood bringer causing you to hurt and forcing you to redefine your relationship with your surroundings it makes you open your eyes and enables you to see much more than what is in front of you while reading this book we see through mirrors across continents into other cultures and unconsciously we feelthat is if we are capable of feeling john a williams has written an extensively handsome and dangerous novel jeanpaul sartre said it is true that all art is false he lied or he was talking about white western art the book in question is a work of art that is if art among other things is a creative effort that others can identify with an accent on a particular lifestyle communication a bringer of knowledge a mind wakener movable prose which is esthetically pleasing and meaningful and in essence one artists comment on life as he views it the work of art is the man who cried i am and the artist is john a williams mr williams fourth novel successfully deals with the many acute problems that confront the black writer as well as the black man this novel should be of the utmost interest to the black writer for it covers the literary world of the black writer over a span of about years that whole blackwhite era of interdependency the protagonist is one max reddick who could very well be williams himself a black journalist for a timestyle magazine and a novelist of some stature the main supporting character is the father of black literature harry ames richard wright the action fluctuates between these two men as the novel unfolds we are introduced to facsimiles of the major black writers and white critics of the last years there are characters who resemble james baldwin chester himes ralph ellison frank yerby carl van vechten granville hicks william faulkner and others on the civil and human rights scene there is martin l king malcolm_x and the philosophies of marcus garvey and w e b du bois max reddick is what one might call an internationalist a oncethe members of miss brooks

game by christine reams was so hot that summer that the air stood still and i had trouble breathing sometimes i would sit on the front porch and breathe slowly i felt as if i were breathing the same air over and over again i turned two shades darker that summer i almost got as black as miss mabel the grownups said it wasnt really the temperature it was the humiditywhatever that is anyway it was a blistering hot summer and i hated it our house was probably the hottest one in town we didnt own it or anything like that we only rented three rooms of it miss mabel and her two children mike and jim lived upstairs over us mike was and i think jim was a year younger mike was dark like his mother and jim was almost white looking some of the folks in the neighborhood said that jims father was a white man i dont know anything about that i never saw mikes or jims father mr frank and his wife miss sally lived upstairs on the other side of the house tina their daughter was about the same age as mike and jim the three of them were always hanging around together since i was only seven at the time they didnt want me around in the first week of june miss ruth moved into the downstairs apartment on tinas side of the house i was happy because miss ruth had a daughter janice and i just knew she was going to play with me janice was much closer to my age than the others besides the others swore in blood that they wouldnt play with her naturally i thought she didnt have anyone to play with except me well it didnt turn out that way janice didnt want to play with anyone she was a reader and every time i turned around she was reading her father was a soldier mike said he was in saigon i dont remember the last names of any of the people who lived in the old house we were told to put mr or miss before the first names of grownups and address them that way we didnt know it was wrong until we had grown older by then it didnt matter everybody thought miss ruth was pretty men liked her they were always coming around to see her there was one who used to come around a lot he was very tallmuch taller than my dad who was five feet ten he had curly hair mama used to say that men like that are blessed with the hair their sisters should have had after all whats good hair to a man curlys yellow skin was smooth and soft looking i always wanted to touch it to see if it were really as soft as it looked one of curlys eyes was smaller than the other when he looked at you it seemed as if one eye was looking at you while the other one was looking at something on the other side of the room i used to hang around waiting for curly sometimes i played jacks on the front porch and watched miss ruth and curly out of the corner of my eye she said he was her cousin but one day i overheard miss mabel tell mama that they were the funniest cousins she had ever seen then she laughed mama shook her head sadly and talked about the lord mama knew all about the lord because she was saved i think she was the only person in the whole house who was saved most of the time curly came to see miss ruth at night he usually brought a carton of beer with him we would stay up late playing hide and seek and curly would still be around when we went inside once i even saw him leaving miss ruths house early in the morning then for no reason at all mike jim and tina started whispering and giggling every time curly came to the house on that day the game started i dont remember who started it probably mike he was always thinking of things to do anyway i wanted to play too one evening while mama and dad were looking at tv i went out to play on the porch janice was already there she sat in a kitchen chair on her side of the porch her head was buried in a book and her feet were propped up on the bannister i looked at her with envy she had on a pair of old blue jeans which someone had cut off at the knees and a dirty white shirt my mother wouldnt let me wear shorts i sat down on the top step and took a small rubber ball out of my skirt pocket i tossed the jacks on the floor janice didnt pay any attention to me i bounced the ball on the porch several times but she didnt even look up i waited until tina came out hey tina i said will you play jacks with me tina shook her head no why i asked gotta talk to mike she said cant you play until he comes no hes coming now tina said she rushed to the screen door as mike and jim dashed down the steps just one game i begged listen honey tina said turning to face me do you wanna play hide and seek with us tonight sure okay keep quiet when were talking business she said business i mumbled hey you hey girl i said calling to janice i stopped when i saw tinas dirty look and pretended i was talking to myself i picked up my ones i heard the screen door open as i started my twos i glanced up and saw miss ruth standing next to janice mike whistled softly miss ruth smiled as she looked across the porch at us she was a short thin woman just five feet tall in heels and she always wore heels she looked cool in her pink sleeveless dress i smiled at her shyly she looked like a fragile toy like something you would pick up carefully and hold gently with both hands hello she said in a soft voice she always spoke softly around us i mumbled and looked down at her tiny feet hi miss ruth mike said hi tina and jim said at the same time they looked at each other and giggled miss ruth turned away from us and leaned over janice why dont you play with them she asked i wanna read janice said her voice sounded hard compared to her mothers you read too much miss ruth said she put her hand on janices shoulder honey you ought to play with other kids janice didnt say anything she didnt seem to be listening im going to get some beer miss ruth said shouldnt be gone long if curly comes before i get back tell him to wait aw right janice said miss ruth walked down the steps her small hips swayed slightly from side to side i watched her until she disappeared i looked over at tina she was standing in a comer talking to mike and jim i looked at janice she was watching us with strange dark eyes i held the jacks up and beckoned to her but she seemed to be looking through me i threw the jacks on the floor and picked up my threes im glad to see you back from the army front mike chanted i picked up the jacks and stared at him curiously he marched across the porch hey now he continued im glad to see you back from the army front tina put her hands over her mouth and giggled jim laughed out loud something funny was going on as usual i was left out of it hey hey jim said im glad to see you back from the army front janice looked up at mike and then at jim and tina at first she seemed puzzled then mike began to switch his hips the way miss ruth did janices mouth swivelled up until it became very small her eyes narrowed they were almost closed she jumped up from the chair and slammed the door as she went inside the house mike and jim marched over to janices side of the porch i hesitated only for a few seconds before joining them im glad to see you back from the army front i shouted in a high pitched voice the lights went out in janices living room im glad to see you i stopped abruptly janices skinny face peered out the window facing the porch she made a fist brought it up to her nose and shook it at me startled and frightened i backed over to our side of the porch jim mike and tina were still chanting when miss ruth and curly walked into the yard curly was carrying a sixpack of beer under his arm his light skin was brightened by his yellow shirt he didnt wear a belt his hips held his brown slacks up and they looked as if they were going to fall down wheres janice miss ruth asked looking around aw she went in mike said miss ruth thanked him with a smile before entering the house she and curly stopped at the door and whispered together for a few minutes afterwards they went inside of the apartment and janice dashed out as quickly as she had dashed inside mike never stopped when he had a good game going army front was a good game every time one of us marched across the porch janices eyes would get narrow and her mouth would shrink we didnt have to say anything all we had to do was march one afternoon when we were all on the porch mike jumped down the steps and ran down the sidewalk for about a block he turned and marched back toward us he stopped in front of the house and looked around then he marched into the yard and up the steps jim dashed over to janices side of the porch and stepped inside of the screen door he put his left hand on his hips and patted his hair with the other one well hello wife mike said he stopped in front of the screen door tina and i giggled it aint hello wife i said its hello darling only white folks talk that way mike said i started to disagree but then i had never heard dad call mama darling maybe mike was right hello wife mike said again im back from the army front jim opened the screen door and stepped out on the porch hello husband he said he put both hands on his hips im glad to see you back from the army front he chanted softly ohhhh tina said running her hand through her short nappy hair oh my hair is so curly so curly janice looked like an animal about to attack i really do have that good stuff tina continued its so curly hey now aint i got curly hair she marched across the porch with mike and jim suddenly i was acting crazy too im glad to see you back from the army front i shouted we thank the lord for your return tina said she threw her hands up in mock prayer oh were so glad to see you back from the army front yes lord were glad to have him back aint we glad to have him back yes lord we is i still love curly hair jim said sadly i just love curly hair do you love curly hair everybody loves curly hair mike said shut up janice screamed throwing her book on the floor shut up you say one more word about my mama whos talking about your old mama mike asked you just say one more word one more word she whimpered and ill knock the shit outta you im gonna tell your mama i said impressed in spite of myself you said a bad word janice enjoyed herself for a few minutes be too late after i knock it outta you im really gonna tell now i said you gonna knock the shit outta me too mike asked he strutted up to janice and pushed his chest out until his body touched hers go on hit me i dare you he said as he looked down into her face hit me hit me i dare you you say one more word about my mama she said we aint talking about your old mama tina said yeah i said drawing courage from the others were just playing a game were just playing army front aint we just playing army front mike thrust his face into janices and laughed im glad to see you janice grabbed him by the throat he tried to pry her hands away from his neck she wouldnt let go then he hit her in the face she swung at him so hard that they both fell on the floor cmon mike jim shouted get her get her tina shrieked i was shocked mike was on the bottom janice was sitting on his stomach bashing him in the face with her fist jim couldnt stand it any longer he jumped on janices back and pulled her off his brother then tina leaped on janice and the three of them wrestled her janice bit kicked and swung her fist wildly the noise grew louder and i was afraid mama would hear us i backed to our side of the porch and sat down on the top step all at once i looked up and saw mama standing at the screen door she stepped out on the porch her face was wet with perspiration and her stomach stuck out so far that it looked as if she had swallowed a watermelon whats all the noise for she asked crossly tina mike and jim released their hold on janice and stood up i stood up too janice rose slowly her nose was bleeding she wiped her face on the bottom of her blouse we all looked ashamed and guilty the way youre supposed to look when grownups catch you doing something wrong but janice put her hands on her hips and glared at my mother with blood still dripping from her nose she looked as if she were going to attack mama mama looked at her with distaste well mama said she waited for an explanation its all her fault mike said quickly sure was mama i said we was out here playing minding our own business miss dorothy tina said then she starts fighting and carrying on sure did mama she said a bad word i said shes always causing trouble miss dorothy jim said cant nobody get along with her do you know what she said mama i said eagerly i dont want to hear none of her nastiness mama said you little heifer why dont you stay on your side of the porch if you cant play nice like the others i am on my side janice said if i had spoken that way i would have been whipped dont you talk back to me mama snapped i dont play with children janice closed her mouth tightly even though she was silent she looked defiant mama was furious she couldnt bear to have anyone stand up to her again i was impressed with janice i dont want to hear no more foolishness from any of you mama said i looked away from mama to the other side of the porch and i saw miss ruth peering through the screen door at us i didnt know how long she had been there nor what she had heard my face grew hot with embarrassment and shame for the first time i really began to feel the summer heat miss ruth opened the screen door and poked her head out of it apparently she had been sleeping for she wore a red bath robe which was unfastened she held it together with one hand whats wrong she asked in a soft voice these kids are fighting again mama said she looked at miss ruth as if she were looking at sin itself i done told em i dont want no more of this foolishness if they disturb me with their noise one more time im gonna give every one of them a good whipping no matter who they belong to she looked at miss ruth to see how she would take her threat miss ruth came out on the porch and let the screen door close she put her arm around janice miss dorothy miss ruth said quietly i know you mean well but i dont let no outsiders touch my child if she does something wrong you tell me and ill punish her miss ruth mama lowered her voice to match miss ruths a body cant be everywhere all the time we cant always see the devilment our children start miss ruth smiled faintly thats true miss dorothy she conceded her small mouth lost its softness i try to do right by everybody mama continued when a body sees betty doing wrong they know they can chastise her its gonna be the same for this one here she touched her stomach you do what you think best for your children miss ruth said but nobody better touch my janice why i dont whip her myself i can believe that mama said i suddenly had a vision of miss ruth attacking my mother the way janice had attacked mike could little miss ruth beat up mama or would mama beat up miss ruth what would daddy say when he came home and found that mama had beaten up miss ruth i didnt like what was going on she dont have no bringing up at all mama continued youd rather carry on with that oneeyed boy than to do right by your own child mike exchanged a glance with tina and they laughed jim with his hands jammed in his pockets leaned against the wall i began to feel uneasy and hot i didnt want to play army front any more i just wanted everybody to stop talking dont talk about my mama janice said suddenly her voice was almost a plead see there talking back to her betters already mama said i always say you reap what you sow and somedav this child here is of gonna pay you back for not doing right by her dont say no more hush miss ruth said to janice i dont mean no harm mama said but i believe in telling things the way they is now you can live the wild life in this world but youre gonna have to come before the lord in the next one mamas voice rose as she began to feel the spirit miss ruth was speechless everybody was quiet i was getting hotter i felt water running off my back for a minute i was afraid that mama would feel the holy ghost then she would begin shouting and thanking the lord for being good enough to feel the holy ghost ive lived a good life mama continued didnt go running around and carrying on and leaving a child to go every which way dont talk about my mama janice said she was breathing hard

and i tried to back away from her look dont you say be quiet miss ruth said harshly then make her shut up janice screamed make her shut her damn mouth miss ruth released her robe and slapped janice across the face bewildered janice backed away from her mother they looked at each other for a long time they looked as if they both were going to cry janices mouth trembled she jumped off the porch

probably making up a new game or thinking of new ways to play the old one i didnt want to be with any of them anymore while mama and miss ruth were discussing mamas condition i walked off the porch then mama yelled at me i didnt run or anything i just kept walking down the street betty mama yelled you get yourself on back here i didnt turn around i just kept walking i found janice in the alley about a block from the house she was lying face down in the middle of the street whatre you doing i asked as i walked up to her go away she said i hate you too she looked funny there was dirt and blood all over her face cmon get up im gonna stay here forever she said until i die you gonna get run over i said i dont care i wanna die why i asked who cares she asked i thought about her question for a while i didnt know what she meant by it but i knew that i didnt hate her and i didnt want to make fun of her anymore i i care i said cmon janice get up as usual janice didnt pay any attention to me i hate everybody she said i hate mama too im gonna stay here till i die then shell be sorry i was already sorry about everything please get up i said fighting back the tears she wouldnt move i walked over to the sidewalk and sat down i wasnt in any hurry to go home i knew i was going to get it when i got there it wouldnt be any little old slap either besides i knew janice couldnt lie in the street forever people drove their cars through that alley and one way or another they would make her move i sat for a long time thinking about janice miss ruth and mama finally janice got up and came over to the sidewalk she sat down next to me i didnt know why she moved from the street maybe she thought that someone cared after all maybe she just got tired of lying there anyway she moved we sat there for a while longer i didnt look at janice because i didnt want to cry and i think maybe she didnt look at me because she didnt want to cry either especially one at a predominantly negro institutionis suspect his intellectual inferiority is assumed if he is writing about negroes his bias is presumed it is a painful jobbut a factthat when a white man studies the culture of negroes his work is sent to another white man for appraisal when a negro writes about negroes his work is sent to three white men what is published and publicized consequently generally repeats whatever white men already believe about the negro what is needed is a negro press a black publisher that will publish and publicize the booklength research of negro scholars i first heard such a request in after a decade negro educators and businessmen have not taken the first step towards such a company negro publishers of magazines evidence their fears that negroes will not buy scholarly publications for they have concentrated their effort and money on periodicals with popular appeal unfortunately they may be correct langston hughes was among those who years ago deplored the unwillingness of negroes to buy books hughes of course referred to popular booksfiction and poetry interest in scholarship is even less faculty negro teachers are needed but the task of securing them is not as simple as might be presumed from listening to the bright young educators who demand a black university let us assume that we are considering establishing a university of studentssmall by standards of the prestige universities colossal for a negro institution let us also propose one teacher for every students certainly not a farfetched standard for an ideal institution that amounts to only teachers plus administrators and secretaries only but that number will not be found among negroes who earn graduate degrees in i do not propose to exclude arbitrarily any candidate who lacks a doctorate degree nor do i wish to denigrate the intellectual ability and the enthusiam of people who may apply but desire is not sufficient knowledge and teaching ability are required furthermore because instruction must be provided in all areas of the curriculum even the capable and welltrained instructors must be screened to make certain that their qualifications are supplementary rather than duplicating for instance it is useless to have four teachers welltrained in zoology if there is no one sufficiently trained in botany since sufficient teachers cannot be secured from new graduates not already committed to particular institutions it will be necessary to raid the faculties of established institutions as anyone knows who has tried it money does not always prove sufficiently strong to pry a teacher from an institution and a community where he has planted roots for himself and his family in time a new institution with sufficient money and satisfactory fringe benefitssuch as geographic location adequate library limited teaching load and cultural activitiescan build as satisfactory a faculty as did duke and chicago to name only two institutions which competed successfully with wellestablished institutions but time is required a decade may not be an unreasonable minimum meanwhile it may be necessary to develop the program at an institution already established for one may strengthen a competent faculty more quickly than create a new one naturally the institution must be selected carefully and means must be devised to exclude from the programor at least minimize the influence oftenured faculty members who apathetic incompetent or hostile cannot contribute wholesomely administration negro administrators have been criticized for incompetence autocratic behavior and egocentricity although the charges are often justifiable competent administrators can be secured from among those already in higher education like teachers however administrators may be unwilling to abandon established posts to gamble with uncertainty i cannot easily condemn a manblack or white who hesitates and finally refuses to dedicate himself to a cause which may require his sacrificing everything which he has spent a lifetime building perhaps therefore the proposed program should be placed under the jurisdiction of a president who has demonstrated excellence at an institution already established before rejecting this suggestion let us examine the major objectionsthat is the criticisms traditionally hurled at negro administrators autocrats have governed and do govern some negro colleges but the negro race owns no monopoly on tyrannical presidents autocratic administration may develop wherever a weak insecure faculty surrenders its rights there is little need to fear that autocratic practices will govern the ideal black university first the president will already have demonstrated excellence competent administrators recognize that educational programs work best when the faculty assists in determining policy second the strong faculty required for the ideal institution will not surrender its rights negro administrators also are accused of incompetence again the failing should not be identified with a particular race incompetent white men preside over colleges just as incompetent negroes do conversely many negroes administer programs effectively just as white men do the fact that some presidents have proved to be incompetent merely emphasizes the need to select a president carefully some men cannot cope with the rapid expansions of colleges today for example an administrator who has governed successfully as a fatherinresidence for a family of five hundred students and seventy teachers may learn that his methods fail when the population doubles traditionally ministers and professors have been selected as presidents of negro colleges ministers are presumed competent to guide the moral as well as the intellectual development of students it is further assumed that brilliant professors can reshape the curriculum imaginatively and can stimulate academic performance characteristic of their own work the fact is however that the complexity of college administration today requires the talents of a corporation executive rather than those of a scholar or a spiritual counselor higher education is big business some key administrator on the campus must know how to secure grants how to organize staff how to handle personnel how to prepare and present budgets and proposals in short someone must know how to operate a big business successfully ideally therefore some top administratora vicepresident perhapsshould be experienced in business management but how many negroes have been given the opportunity to exercise their talents as executives in large corporations whereas some white colleges may complain that they cannot find business executives willing to accept lower salaries as vicepresidents negro colleges must complain of the scarcity of negroes with sufficient executive experience to serve even as visiting consultants an ideal institution needs a triumvirate of key administrators one man experienced in managing a corporation who manages the operation a second man an imaginative scholarwho spearheads the academic program a third man knowledgeable about budgets taxes and law who serves as financial officer naturally as a scholar i would name the academic man to the post of president each of the three however is essential to a successful operation and each must find sufficient prestige and satisfaction in his own position that he will not seek to usurp the responsibilities of the other two new programs and experimentation the new courses proposed earlier do not complete the academic reforms which are needed new curricula must prepare negro students for occupations previously closed to them many predominantly negro colleges starving financially cannot afford the additional expense of new programs no matter how desirable they may be for example if only five students seek training for college personnel positions an impoverished institution may argue that it cannot afford to offer such a program instead it will continue to prepare the fifty students interested in elementary and secondary school counseling thus colleges economically forced to perpetuate the traditional fail to prepare negro students for new occupations the black university may suffer similar financial hardships yet it must offer new programs otherwise it will betray its students and in fact may lose prospective students to larger universities which can afford such programs the black university also must discard the characteristic conservativism of most negro institutions fearing criticism for failure negro institutions rarely have gambled on educational experiments many of the socalled experiments in curriculum and method merely revive antiquated and abandoned practices or these experiments abandon academic standards under the pretext of respecting the socalled culture of the negro experimentation must be encouraged there should be experiments in methods of teaching experiments with nongraded courses experiments with tutorial sessions but experiments must be conducted systematically control groups should be compared with the experimental groups and student performance should be tested and evaluated always the experiment should be designed to discover the most effective means of achieving desired results never merely to confirm the validity of a predetermined hypothesis possibly experimentation will prove that many students cannot reach the required level of competence within four years if so the students must be retained longer college education thus will not be envisioned as four years of courses producing a diploma as automatically as nine months of development produce a child instead it should be viewed as the movement toward a goal the duration determined by the knowledge stamina and quickness of the student the need for new programs and experimentation is a problem for all of higher education not merely for negro institutions i must reemphasize however that the term experiment or curriculum development should not mask a condescending acceptance of inadequate performance by negroes for example some educators currently advise teachers to respect the dialect and the culture of negro students since no studies have determined what that dialect is some educators would accept all habits of language usage no matter how far they deviate from the standard since studies do not describe the negros culture some educators excuse irresponsibility for example as characteristic of that culture such permissiveness further injures the negro student who after graduating seeks a professional or technical position the professional world expects that college graduates will use language identified with professional people and that they will demonstrate responsibility for example few employers will hire secretaries who will say i aint got none of them whether the secretary speaks with the accent of boston or charleston does not matter but the employer expects a different level of usage the employerblack or whitedoes not care whether the secretarys parents and friends speak that way he assumes that if she wishes to retain that pattern of usage she should work among them rather than impose her dialect on his business similarly no one whether a white man or a raceproud black manwants an irresponsible doctor or even an irresponsible plumber theatre music art the black university should provide a training ground for young actors playwrights composers musicians and artists no theatre today provides adequate opportunity for struggling actors and playwrights to develop their talents once again the problem is not restricted to the negro a young white playwright experiences equal difficulty in gaining experience by staging his dramas we are concerned however with the development of negro artists an adequately financed university should be able to maintain a resident company of young writers and performers who could share with students their professional experiences limited though they may be and who would have a stage on which to develop their talent similarly the black university must house a substantial collection of works by negro writers and scholars and a museum of art by black men both collections require money and the services of fulltime directors who have time and travel expenses to search for the necessary materials the resident company the library and the museum can be established and maintained as easily at a predominantly negro institution already established as at a new institution trustees if i seem indifferent to trustees the reason is only that as a teacher and quasi or semiadministrator i have considered trustees only as businessmen who give the blessing of the practical world to the dreams of educators i foresee less difficulty in securing trustees than in securing anything else for the black university jackie robinson ralph bunche mayor carl stokes of cleveland or mayor richard hatcher of gary publisher john h johnsonthese are only a few who are possible trusteesallblack or allnegro or allafroamerican or whatever you wish to call those peoplecan be found prestige the final need of the black university is for prestige even newly established white institutions require time to build reputations but i fear that in america a black university will never earn national reputation as long as it uses only black teachers to instruct only black students and i wonder how long negro students will retain pride in their institution unless that pride is respected by nonblacks this is perhaps the final reason reaffirming for me my original conclusion that the desired results may be obtained more effectively by building upon an already established predominantly negro university rather than attempting to establish a new institution secure the necessary money whether from black men or white men and add this to the money already in the budget of a school secure administrators whose talents supplement those of a competent administrator who already has experience secure teachersblack or whitewho have the knowledge and the ability to teach the desired courses and use them to strengthen a staff which already has numbers and competence accept students white or blackwho wish to experience the education provided then revise the curriculum to meet the needs and demands what results will not be the black university for it accepts white money white faculty and white students but it should be the kind of institution best designed to provide adequate opportunity for black teachers and students to develop their capabilities fully to serve the black community effectively to gain pride in and knowledge of their heritage and themselves and to achieve recognition for their ability and these after all are the major purposes for which a black university is proposed standards were the methods of selecting dismissed individuals dr nabrit saidall the people have uniformly said weve used the scholarship methodweve read in the paper somewhere rightly or wrongly that these people were in some way associated with the disturbance and thats a scholastic way to approach the situation george hayes howard attorney assumed a lawyer calhoun demeanor and wailed that there has been a suggestion of black powwuh delivered in the baptist preachers fireandbrimstone tones he further insinuated that i had caused the fires reading a statement from an article on howard i had written in the washington free press there i had said of the administration they dont seem to hear the thunder and so the boycott last wednesday the fire next time obviously employing the titles of two wellknown novels about the racial scene in a confidential report to his superior the associate dean of students carl anderson set forth ludicrous and needless to say erroneous conclusions based on the viewing of a film by members of the staff and two students employed as spies the film of a hershey hearing had been turned over to howard by a local television station whose white reporter had gotten into an argument with black militant students outside the building and was knocked down and hospitalized the trouble with this was that the howard investigators had a film with no sound consequently they watched anthony gittens in the room legitimately as a witness and jay greene who sought to bring the militant crowd under control and concluded from that that they were inciting the crowd to rebellion the confidential report also erroneously declared the black_power committee under the control of sncc and the communist party and labeled the father of one student a communist the report listed the names of members of the black_power committee only one of them was actually a member one student who was listed as a member art goldberg was white from this kind of evidence an ad hoc kangaroo disciplinary committee of faculty officials meted out punishment from dismissals to warnings and dormitory purges to students including andre mckissick daughter of cores floyd mckissick faculty members dismissed were merely outspoken faculty members whose contracts conveniently expired that year they had violated the cult of mediocrity originated in howards early years when christian character and republican principles were just as political docility is now the prime prerequisites for employment and promotion the only other accusations aside from acting president stanton l wormleys labeling of me and prof ivan eames as fellow racists came from president nabrit who was almost never on campus who said that there had been shovings and some kind of physical contact these teachers had been involved in this kind of activity this of course was a baldfaced lie in the recent months four additional professors of unquestioned professional performance have been refused reappointment apparently for political views more retaliations are to come with each years expiration of contractsas things now standuntil all persons of a divergent political hue have left in disgust or been dismissed when news of last summers firings reached me i had been lecturing at the university of wisconsin at milwaukee after some weeks i returned to washington and suggested in passing when responding in the local press to nabrits boasts of his past civil_rights legal work that at least now having outlived his usefulness after serving well in his day and receiving his reward he should have the decency to get out of the way i left town again shortly and nabrit who had one year left before reaching the mandatory retirement age and who had spent half of the previous year officially working away from howard as a salesman of lbjs foreign policy announced his retirement i was sitting at a conference breakfast table when i read this in the washington post and i immediately exclaimed to my companions that it was a propaganda a public relations stunt my skepticism was based in part on long exposure to the conniving dishonest approach of the howard administration later i was to learn that howards public relations director who highlighted the hershey affair when the selection of student defendants clearly indicated that the black_power committee was the target had received a special citation from the american association of college public relations officials he also played up the black_power issue after the firing of six professors four of them white and i the only black_power advocate in the six unfortunately a group of dismissed students and faculty members misread nabrits resignation as did just about everybody else and called a press conference to announce it as a victory for our cause they also suggested kenneth b clark a member of howards board of trustees as a successor to nabrit which caused me to exclaim unconsciously aloud as soon as i had read it i was aware that if you write a book called tan ghetto people will think you moderate dark ghetto a militant and black ghetto a flaming radical hence it did not surprise me a few paragraphs later when i read that clark had denounced our movement as psychotic while commending the ways of nabrit in september nabrit was to announce that he had never written a letter of resignation and would not indeed that he might defy the mandatory rule and stay on several years then the day after the first fight of my current boxing comeback in december in which i won by a knockout in minutes and seconds of the first round nabrit announced in the press for the second time that he would not retire we went to court in augusti belatedly and reluctantly for i felt that that would turn the matter over to the mercy of the great white courts which might rule on a legal technicality rather than on pure justice also howard students and teachers should any still care or remember by september would tend to accept the courts decision as infallible or equally as bad await it passively our lawyers assured us that the case would be over by september and i felt i had to go along because other faculty members thought that my staying out would hurt their case the judge who handled it an octogenarian had a reputation for conservatism as well as for making the wrong decision in the opinion of the courts of appeals where the case is now we did not therefore expect a favorable decision and time and again during the courtroom proceedings the biased and illogical comments of the elderly judge brought down the courtroom in laughter i discovered meanwhile that the members of the black_power committee had been imprisoned in a summer riotprevention roundup of black militants in this case for conspiring to incite a riot as bail money could not be raised for them at the time they could not return to howard this left me standing on the battlefield with no forces and so i worked along with other student leaders who planned a boycott for september i also remembered all the help local black leadersnot to mention howard students and professorsunsolicited by mehad promised throughout the preceding year and i planned at last to solicit their aid however student leaders were strongly against outside forces then just before school started the students were reinstated though most of them went elsewhere generally to better schools one of them is said to have told the other students to work on forming a student judiciary committee instead of risking protest i personally heard a dismissed professor discourage rebellion before he left for another college student leaders and professors posing as militants echoed this advice now students who previously had urged me not to round up and bring in outside forces informed me that there would be no boycott and suggested that i use the outside forces they had just learned that members of the black_power committee which had stolen the campus leadership from the liberalmoderate student establishment the year before were now away in jail at about this time the local affiliates of newarks national black_power conference formed a washington committee for black_power of which i was elected chairman i sought help with the howard movement from them and from other black militants but none came forward nor did any black group raise funds or contribute to the bill for court costs although some area white professors held a fundraising party and some american university students held a fundraising concert howard students did nothing along these lines although the militants put on a party to raise bail money for a person never connected with howard and who had in fact help persuade the washington committee for black_power to evade the howard struggle on the formal opening of howard a walkout was planned by militant students for president nabrits address only three professors again all whitecould be persuaded to take an active part keith lowe harvardtrained english professor who had been part of the summers purge stood with me on the sidewalk to greet students and faculty members walking out of the auditorium as students gathered round and cheered the voice of professor lowe an oriental reared in jamaica grew hoarse as he implored i have seen you act as full human beings dont let your struggle slip back i warned the students that the only hope is to close howard down indefinitely until a ruthless helterskelter administration buckles under in repentance i did not know that that also had been the view of mordecai johnson former president of howard when the congressional appropriations committee attemped to suppress academic freedom at howard early in the mccarthy era but as in the case of last years boycott student militants mistakenly seeking wide participation had turned the leadership of the protest over to establishment students i know now that the major reason for the black_power committees relative strength last year rested in its exclusiveness although this angered many students who regarded themselves as black radicals and had reputations for constant espousals of the glory of blackness and revolutionary rhetoric these students may still be found at this game beating their chests and reading and parroting frantz fanon and maotse tung and it is clear now that they cannot be expected to do much else then there are the grand organizers i recently attended a unifying meeting of the representatives of different groups each proposing to have the cure for howards ills when i finally left the meeting at midnight they had not managed to get together on anything other than the prohibition of campus activity by any single membergroup later learned that they agreed on a collective name whose acoustics formed an african word but they have done nothing since which rememberis what they agreed that no membergroup should do anything this nothingness pervades the air at howard although steve abel student chairman of the united black peoples party appears to try hard and to mean business but he has little or no help and freshman class president michael harris who has much promise but has not yet had the time to lose his faith in the lies and promises of howards administration and establishmentstudent leaders did stage a sitin in president nabrits office protesting compulsory rotc against abels will the students were persuaded by establishmentleaders to break up the sitin on the promise that nabrit would eliminate compulsory rotc this promise may yet be fulfilled but in any case at best it is a paper victory in more than one sense of the word understand me there still are maybe truly militant students left at howard which would be enough to detonate the movement should they ever manage to shake off the control of the administrations student flunkies studentlounge radicals and other phonies adrienne manns editor of the hilltop for example has done a brilliant job along with anthony gittens chairman of project awareness in making students aware also it is said that time makes more converts than reason and it may come to pass that the next time nabrit announces his retirement howard students per cent of whom oppose his administration according to a hilltop survey may have the courage to run him out of town as of this writing the atmosphere at howard appears to the casual visitor to loom thick with the sickness of a strange and eerie apathy administrators cling to the erroneous notion that a university can stand upon guns cunning and connivance unwary it seems of the fact that history is a vengeful lady and when once it retaliates can be a vicious executioner students and professors walk around virtually wrapped in a cautious trance as if ready to run at the sound of boo some wear the faces of grinning mummies hucklebucking no less in mock glee in and out of the punch out and other student hangouts i walk through the campus on occasion and now and again students wave or grin at me or come over to shake my hand and to inquire about my welfare and it saddens me to see that they are not concerned about their own it is sadder still to see in their faces and reactions and frequently frank apologies and rationalizations a recognition that they have played into the hands of dishonesty and disgrace to their own heritage bartered away selfrespect for insulation against the risk of delay or inconvenience in getting themselves ratified no pun intended for the rat race they feel lies ahead some of them may never realize how cheaply they sold out but students unlike professors are not stuck forever in the cesspool of howards mediocrity many will be able to shake off the crippling influences of their college years and someday reclaim their lives elsewhere and make full contributions to the world and to their race the professors who remain must either face dismissal or be left to quiver aimlessly in the quicksand of induced docility i have watched them day by day young professors with style and promise already losing their spark grumbling in the dark but falling silent and teethy when administrators walk by old men now dissatisfied but powerless at this late date to move driven to drink in bars near the campus discussing the books begun five to years ago which their frozen pens will now never finish the day before christmas eve i stopped by an asylum to visit a former howard professor and friend incarcerated there he had been one of the deans of negro literature and black thought in the days when howard was in its heyday sought out for guidance by a generation of black students when howards faculty directory read like a whos who among negro scholars in late november someone had told me how he stood in a faculty meeting and angrily threatened should howard go through with a proposal to give all this years honorary degrees to white individuals he would write exposes which would make nathan hares seem mild within two weeks they compelled him to retire leave of absence beginning the second semester until the end of the year and then goodby after over thirty years on the faculty in a few days he was taken by force to st elizabeths hospital coming down the corridor on the day of my visit he looked well for his age and in good health on approaching closer he recognized me and refused to see me stating that he did not wish to see anybody from howard again i am glad i was a howard professor but i also am glad that howard fired me penniless writer he travels the gamut from beans and ham hocks to plush meals in europe he leaves the negro paper for a more profitable position on a liberal white one his published novels become a measured success so successful that one eventually goes into paperback he joins the white house staff as a speech writer for a kennedytype president and leaves unhappily because the president doesnt use any of his speeches he emasculates his manhood through his relationships with black and white women and soon becomes a carboncopy of that white boy lillian patch who is killed because of an abortion was of course the prototype of the negro professional woman one who had acquired all the white values of her society and who wished to live those values lillian and max would have gotten married had max had a better paying job and had he moved more swiftly into the american mainstream max made the mistake of letting lillian wear the pants and in effect lost himself and lillian after a short depression period brought on by the death of lillian max is regenerated through a job with the new york centurya liberal white paperand the publication of his third novel after a successful stay at the century max leaves and joins pace a timestyle magazine and works his way up to chief of its african bureau the scene of the novel shifts from the united states to africa and europe while in africa we learn such things as the truth about the african slave trade that black africans own a very small percentage of their land that the black masses of south africa with its own system of apartheid have a higher standard of living than the masses of africans in other areas of the continent we learn that the majority of black leaders in the independent nations of africa are just as devious selfish and prowestern as the black middleclass in the united states in europe we have glimpses of jeanpaul sartre albert camus and the whole frenchblack intellectual association as in the europe of hemingway pound eliot joyce and fitzgerald black writers are not wanted or needed finally while we are in europe we come to the revolutionary discovery of the king alfred contingency plan for the detention and systematic extermination of the afroamerican people while attending the funeral of harry ames max is given this highly secret information by harrys white mistress as max reads the letter from harry explaining the plan his physical pain cancer of the rectum leaves him and is replaced with the pain of knowing too much and we share this pain as max reads panic in washington ensued when it was discovered that jaja not only had information on the alliance but on king alfred the contingency plan to detain and ultimately rid america of its negroes mere american membership in the alliance would have been sufficient to rock america but king alfred would have made negroes realize finally and angrily that all the new movesthe laws and committees to gain democracy for them were fraudulent just as minister q and the others have been saying for years your own letter to me days after you left the white house only underscored what so many negro leaders believed the one alternative left for negroes would be not only to seek that democracy withheld from them as quick and as violently as possible but to fight for their very survival king alfred as you will see leaves no choice have black people ever had a choice no yet the new york times reviewer said of the king alfred plan here believability falters the saturday review adds to white americas illusions with the assertion it reads rather like an antiwhite protocols of the elders of zion the nation said of the contingency it is an unlikely possibility that deflects attention from the ways power and prejudice actually work inevitable black genocide is a risky thing to base your whole vision upon a white critic reviewing a black book feels that the king alfred contingency plan is not only fiction but borders on science fiction were detroit and newark fiction were the deaths of three college students in south carolina two shot in the back fiction is the formation of one thousand vigilantes posse in chicago to fight off rioters fiction and what about the purchasing of armored cars mace an eyeirritating nauseous gas banana peel a chemical that makes a street too slippery to walk on polycarbonate riot shields grenade launchers for gauge shotguns and other weapons by city and state governments one can go further even after reading the socalled scholarly criticism in transaction and refer to the report from iron mountain the report not only legitimizes war but suggests that the government reconsider the reintroduction of slavery another possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction in some form consistent with modern technology and political processes of slavery as a black writer i can look at the man who cried i am from a different perspective and indeed see king alfred being implemented today no doubt about it mr williams can write he proved that with night song and sissie but the williams of this novel transcends the artist and becomes the seer the prophet one of the poor points of the book was the authors main characters consistent relationship with white women max and harry had white wives and max forever wanted a redhead when will we stop hating ourselves and start loving our own women as one black woman put it williams makes a fool of himself in this respect i guess he couldnt write any other way since he has one for a wife it is interesting to note that the black man will share his hard times with the black woman but when it comes to fame and fortune it looks better with a white woman at his side williams is ambiguous when he states that it was one thing to sleep with white women but quite another to marry them yet the two main figures in his novel had white wivesa part of being accepted i guess after seriously thinking about the ending for some time my conclusion is that it could happen mainly because we know for a fact that black fbi and cia agents do exist they are being used today in africa and in the black communities of the united states as for the minute transatlantic call max makes to minister q malcolm_x to tell about the king alfred contingency i regard it as extreme stupidity but then again what else would a negro do max as king negro had in actuality lost meaningful contact with his people he had left home a long time ago and had no intention of coming back if max had been in tune he would have had brothers in europe who would have helped him the value of this novel cannot be measured in terms of copies sold or reviews written to date it has not sold as well as confessions of nat turner for obvious reasons and most of the major white critics completely overlooked it this i believe is an indication of its importance ramparts magazine called it the toughest novel of the fall and ran an excerpt in its december issue this too indicates its value for this is the first time if i am not mistaken that a novel by an afroamerican has been excerpted in a major white publication yes john a williams has written a dangerous novel and when the order comes down from the regime that books with dangerous teachings should be publicly burnt the man who cried am will start the firedon l justed for price changes in dollars so they show the actual situation for all families during the sixties the data on family income are related to the number of persons within the family who are producing an income in more black than white families had two or three persons within the family bringing home paychecks but still a black family with three persons bringing home a salary median income of made less than a white family with just one earner between and median family income for blacks went up from to and from to for whites in statistical terms the median income for black families increased by percent while the increase for white families was percent consequently black families made percent as much as white families in and percent as much as white families in it would appear from these figures that black families were overtaking white families in their quest for a more equitable share of the nations resources but if you look at the statistics again and do a little calculating you will see that in a white family made more than a black family and in white families made more than black families the data show continued from page clearly then that in relative terms black families are overtaking whites but in absolute terms the situation is getting worse one of the most profound and perplexing problems which has plagued the black community for generations has been the conflict between males and females the income picture for persons as differentiated from families shows one underlying aspect of this conflict between and median income for black males years and older increased from to and for white males from to the percentage increase in the median income of the black male was percent as compared to a percent increase for the white male in a black man made percent as much as a white man and in he made percent as much in actual dollars the black man made less than a white man in and less in just as it was in family income the relative situation for the black man improved between and while the absolute situation declined of even greater interest to our understanding is that higher levels of education did not significantly improve the relative or absolute situation of the black man in a black man with eight years of school made percent as much as a white man with a similar education a black high school graduate made percent as much as a white man with a high school diploma and a black man who had some college made percent as much as a white man with some college in actual dollars this meant that in a black man with an elementary school education made less than a white a black with four years of high school made less and a black man with some college made less in a black man with elementary school education made percent as much as a white the high school graduate made percent as much and the black man who went to college made percent as much and in actual terms the income differences were and less respectively as we indicated earlier the picture is a confusing one but let us summarize the income situation of the black man in as compared to and black men as compared to white men in black men had a higher median income than in and this was true at all educational levels in the relative situation between black and white men had improved at all educational levels but the absolute situation had improved only for black men with eight years of education it had worsened for those with high school diplomas or who had attended college furthermore the relative situation had improved least and the absolute situation dedined worst for those who had college training this means that at the higher educational levels white men are moving so rapidly in america that black men at the same levels are barely keeping up the situation for black women for the same period of time and in the same age category is quite different median income for black women went up from in to in and for white women the change was to respectively in relative terms the income of black women increased by percent and that of white women by percent so that while black women made percent as much as whites in they made percent as much in in black women made less than whites and less in therefore in both relative and absolute terms the income situation for black women has improved since the nature of the relative and absolute improvement is seen more clearly when we analyze changes by educational levels in a black woman with eight years of school made percent as much as a white woman with similar education a black woman with a high school diploma made percent as much as a white woman and a black woman with some college made percent as much as a white woman with similar education by a black woman with eight years of school made percent as much as a white woman a black woman with a high school diploma also made percent as much and a black woman with some college made percent more than a white woman with similar education median income for a black woman with some college education in was more than the median income of the white woman with similar education although the data on income trends for blacks is confusing we believe several conclusions are justified in terms of family income the black population has made some relative improvements in the sixties but our absolute situation has remained virtually the same if we remember that it takes at least three earners in a black family to produce a median family income anywhere close to that of a white family with one earner we can certainly say there has been no improvement in the income situation of the black family we have to work three times harder and we still do not keep up with the majority of americans when we consider income of persons it is apparent as it has long been apparent that the black female is much more capable of matching and exceeding her white counterpart than is the black male furthermore while black females with higher levels of education exceed white females black males with higher levels of education fall further behind white males this economic picture aggravates so many of the subtle psychological problems facing the black family and the relations between black men and women earlier we pointed to two contradictory trends in the black population during the sixties the general social and economic picture of black families in the cities gives some foundation to the belief of some experts that black people may be moving in two directions recent special censuses in many of the major cities of the country are showing that since there has been relatively little improvement for many black families and in some cases a reversal in our situation in many cities the unemployment rates for blacks have been virtually the same throughout the sixties there has been no improvement in family income and often there is a rise in the proportion of families which are headed by women a notable example is the hough area of cleveland where the male unemployment rate was virtually unchanged from to and family income declined by percent the situation is not getting worse for all black people in major cities however and the trends bear very close observation and cautious interpretations there is no doubt that a larger black middleclass is coming into existence and there are some who would hold that these blacks are better off but we must ask better off in relation to what are they better off in relation to their previous situation in relation to lowincome blacks or in relation to whites in the same areas in which they live some limited data from cleveland provide us with some tentative answers to what may be happening to black people in various parts of the large cities of the nation while most of clevelands black population is generally found in nine neighborhoods some black people live outside of these areas in some percent of the black people in cleveland lived outside of the black community area and in percent of the black people lived outside of this area if we assume that in general those living away from the black community are middleincome people and those within the community lowincome blacks we can compare some of the characteristics of these two groups of blacks and then compare them to middleincome whites in cleveland the table lists some of the social and economic characteristics of these three groups in cleveland for and in middleincome black people had a fertility ratio the number of children under five for every women aged much lower than that of lowincome blacks indicating that poor blacks had more children to care for and less money with which to do so than their more prosperous brothers the proportion of children under living with both parents gives some indication of family stability and here the middleincome blacks were also better off for a higher percentage of their children live in stable families furthermore middleincome blacks had a full year more of completed school than did those in lowincome areas although middleincome blacks have an employment rate lower than that of lowincome blacks both groups have high levels of employment the difference between the two groups is most clearly seen in the income statistics middleincome blacks have a much lower proportion of families and the very low income category and a higher proportion in the category of those families making from eight to fifteen thousand dollars per year therefore the median income of the poor black families was only percent as much as the median income of the black families living outside of the black community we can confidently say that in cleveland in middleincome blacks were better off than lowincome blacks by the fertility ratio for all black families had declined considerably but the middleincome blacks still had much lower fertility than lowincome blacks the proportion of stable families in two communities went in opposite directions it got worse for the low income blacks and better for the middleincome blacks while both groups improved in their educational levels the middleincome blacks improved so much more rapidly that by they had over one and a half years more of completed education than did lowincome blacks the unemployment picture in was most interesting for the relationship of the males to each other did not change even though the general rates were lower for both groups the lowincome black women had a higher level of unemployment in while the unemployment rate for middleincome black women plummeted to below percent the effect of these diverging trends in female employment is seen in the income data in the lowest income category there has been virtually no change for lowincome blacks and a dramatic improvement for middleincome blacks while both groups saw improvements in the upper income categories there were twice as many middleincome black families making from eight to per year as there were lowincome blacks consequently the poor black families had a median income only percent as high as that of their more prosperous brothers a decline from the situation in the median income for middleincome black families was more than it was for lowincome black families and by it was more the evidence suggests that not only were middleincome black people in cleveland better off than lowincome black people in in the period since the middleincome blacks were moving further away from lowincome blacks in terms of family organization education employment and income the black population in one of americas major cities is moving in two different directions it appears given the comparative standing of middle and lowincome black families to each other in cleveland in and how do the middleincome black families compare to the white families who live in the same area as they do here we are unable to obtain all the data necessary for comparison like that above and the available data are not as satisfactory as we would wish for there were significant changes in the number of black and white families in the area under consideration while the number of black families living outside of the black community doubled in the five year period an increase of percent the number of white families declined by percent apparently as whites moved further away from middleincome black families in black families in middleincome areas of cleveland had a much higher level of fertility than white families and a much lower level of family stability black people were twice as likely as whites to be unemployed and consequently they had much lower income levels than whites over a fourth of the black families fell into the lowest income category as compared to a fifth of the white families and in the higher income categories the whites consistently outstripped the blacks some rather profound changes had taken place by the fertility level of the blacks was much closer to that of the whites as a consequence of a slight rise in white fertility and a large drop in black fertility black families were still characterized by more problems than white families however as only percent of all black youth under were living with both parents as compared to percent of the white youth the most significant change was in the unemployment levels black men were still twice as likely as white men to be without employment but black women had a much lower unemployment rate than white women finally there was a considerable equalization in the distribution of families by income levels it is true that more black than white families were in the lowest income category but the difference between the two groups was reduced greatly on the other hand the difference in the proportion of families in the highest income category was increased in favor of the whites while in the middlerange categories the black and white families were almost equitably distributed the general point we have been trying to articulate in this discussion of middle and lowincome black families in cleveland and their comparison to white families is in answer to the question if things have been getting better for some black people in the sixties what does getting better mean the data would suggest that middleincome black families are outdistancing lowincome black families in cleveland so in relation to each other the absolute and relative situation of middleincome blacks is getting better and that of lowincome blacks is getting worse however in a comparison of middleincome blacks to whites in the same area the data are suggestive if not conclusive in middleincome black families were in a rather unfavorable position as compared to white families by the situation had improved for two possible reasons many white families had moved out of the city in flight from the influx of black people and those whites who remain behind may fall into the lowest and highest income categories and black women carried a considerable portion of the incomeproducing activities of black families thus making it possible for their families to exist in some reasonable comparison to the white families who remained in the area the situation for black men as compared to white men had not improved at all it was the continuation of the feminine practice of supporting the family which has apparently made it possible for the black families in cleveland to improve their situation in relation to the white families in this paper we have tried to specify some of the major demographic trends in the black community in the sixties to underscore some of the issues that must be taken into account in the development of a black university the data indicate that black people are becoming a larger portion of the population in the nations largest cities and we have moved into a situation of influential control in at least one third of the largest cities other data which we have not discussed here indicate that the blacks moving into the larger cities tend to be young people who are better educated and more likely to engage in whitecollar occupations than the whites who remain in these cities furthermore the data indicate that in the sixties black people have been seeking education more than ever before however in occupations and in employment there has been no substantial improvement for the black population with the exception of some notable changes for black women while black people have shown improvement over previous periods in income in relation to whites in america the situation is not as favorable black men particularly those with higher levels of education are no more able now than they were previously to match white men in income on the other hand black women compare much more favorably with white women in producing incomes and at the higher educational levels black women clearly excel white women in income when we can separate middle and lowincome blacks we see that middleincome blacks are improving their social and economic situation much faster than lowincome blacks thus the two groups are getting further apart and there is evidence that middleincome black families have been able to make gains on middleincome white families but primarily because of the incomeproducing ability of black women a black university must address itself to the changes taking place in the black community and two profound conditions have been presented in this article we must carefully consider the consequences of the fact that in these times the burden of family support still falls heavily upon the shoulders of black women how this affects black men in particular and black families in general must be given very close attention as we attempt to respond to the conditions and needs of the black community secondly we must consider the significance of the split between middle and lowincome blacks that has clearly developed in the sixties it would seem safe to say that many prosperous blacks are being rewarded in this country while many poor blacks are taking to the streets there must be a philosophy and ideology which will unite the black community regardless of economic condition or social status if our prosperous brothers continue to prosper by putting their wives in the labor force and begin to forget it may well be that in the s one century after the emancipation decade of the s we may see the reinstatement of the old houseslave versus fieldslave dichotomy using income education and place of residence as the basis of differentiation lord have mercy black art by jon lockard on onye lockard is a selftaught artist a fact which might have something to do with his choice of subjects for as an artist mr lockard is not much concerned about the art class geometries and the delicacy of shadow on a rose his art is directed toward human beings and to delineating their beauty their anguish and their joys the impact of mr lockards work is evident on the next three pages but it is to be regretted that negro digest is unable to reproduce the three paintings in color for colorin more than one senseis most important in mr lockards work the faces and the hands are black very black but touched with that deep umber which suggests the earth and the backgrounds which appear merely dark in black and white are shades of blue red and flameorange in the original mr lockard a detroit native currently lives and works in ann arbor mich where his studio ann arbor art centre s fourth ave is located he formerly operated studio in detroit specializing in commercial art and illustrations and attended wayne state university as an art major he now concentrates on portraits color prints of the paintings reproduced here are available through mr lockards studio they are by inches in size and sell for each they also are available framed at additional cost framed x prints are available for s the unframed prints also are available at vaughns book store in detroit and at ellis book store in chicago that something is gravely wrong with the conventional approach to the education of black children no longer is arguable much of the problem of course is general there is something gravely wrong with american education period however as always in a society whichbeing racist by natureassigns opportunities and rewards according to race and color those people suffer most who are regarded least and those people in the american society are black people it is a hopeful sign that some of the brightest young people who have chosen education as their profession are deeply concerned about the deficiencies of existing educational institutions particularly as these institutions relate to black students and the communities from which the students come these educators are no longer willingas so many of their predecessors were to sit back comfortably and garner laurels and enjoy status while the talent and potential of the masses of black children are criminally wasted the idea of a black universityan institution designed to serve the real and total needs of the black communityhas taken root and there is every reason to believe that the idea will grow and eventually take concrete shape the special issue of negro digest devoted to a consideration of the concept of the black university developed through discussions with gerald mcworter a recent phd graduate of the university of chicago now an assistant professor of sociology at fisk university in nashville in his outline letter to the other contributors to this special issue of negro digest mr mcworter said that the articles dealing with facets of the proposed black university would concern themselves with a vision the articulation of an ought for the future he made it clear that the concept of the black university as envisioned by himself and the editors was concerned with the entire spectrum of social economic psychological and cultural imperatives which characterize influence and control the black community in a further clarification by the editors the black university concept was described as also being concerned with the art of black people and with the development and articulation of a black esthetic it is concerned with the conscious strengthening of those institutions which make the black community viable and it is dedicated to the liberation of black students and black people generally from the inhibiting and crippling presumptions which have been imposed upon black life and culture from outside the black community the projected special issue on the black university was conceived with five basic articles in mind plus two case studies of existing black educational institutions the proposed areas of concern for the five articles were as follows the black university toward a conceptual model policy and support trustees administrations and funding the academic process faculty students courses research the black university and its community social change in the sixties and the international perspective the third world that the articles as presented fall short of the goal set for the special issue of the magazine is testimony more to the inflexible demands of deadlines and the preciousness of time than to any failing on the part of the contributors all educators of the highest competency despite the inadequacy of time however they have presented here an urgent and imaginative educational prospect one which will surely engage black students and educators more deeply in the days to come for their efforts and for their service to the community negro digest is most grateful hoyt w fuller managing editor what is this thing called negritude for africa in particularand for much of the rest of the world in generalthe era of western discovery exploration and occupation constituted a long night of exploitation and domination and while colonialism scourged most of the nonwhite world only the black men from africa were massively enslaved corralled by the millions and transported in chains across the seas to alien lands torn from their roots forbidden access to their cultural sustenance assigned roles as eternal drones the black men from africa drawing from some uncommon racial reservoir nonetheless found the strength and the strategy to endure the long night is now receding before a new dawn but the coming light alone cannot heal the deep affliction induced by the prolonged darkness strong medicine is required to cure the disease of degrada tion and negritude has been offered as antidote to the ancient evil of antiblack racism it was a group of black intellectuals in paris who first advanced the idea of negritude cesaire aime a poet from the french antilles and leopold sedor senghor a poetstatesman from senegal chief among them senghor now president of the republic of senegal remains the principal proponent of negritude and he sums it up in these words negritude is the whole complex of civilized valuescultural economic social and politicalwhich characterize the black peoples or more precisely the negro african world in other words the sense of communion the gift of mythmaking the gift of rhythm a myth which evolves with its circumstances into a form of humanism united nations president alex quaisonsackey of ghana defines negritude as an acceptance and affirmation of the quality of blackness a psychological gathering together of all black peoples in the spiritual bonds of brotherhood and american professor st clair drake terms negritude a soft and resilient rather than a hard and mechanical approach to life a deep resentment over subordination to white people during the years of slave trade and the subsequent structuring of caste relations here and in africa i negritude then is also a form of racialismyes but in the words of french philosopher jeanpaul sartre antiracial racialism therein lies the difference and dr drake explains antiracist racialism was brought into view by its opposite which is aggressive exploitative racism and the whole concept of negritude assumes in its dialectic that antiracist racialism is destined to disappear
the black revolution is international by rukudzo murapa of us have tended to equate slavr ery with the mass transportation of africans bqund in chains by heartless christian adventurers from their native homelands to far off sugar and cotton plantations in america to give slavery such a limited definition is to deny the historical facts of black experience on the african continent ever since the first christian slavehunting whiteman planted his foot on the west coast of africa if the system that brought the african to america was slave trade then the system that remained on the continent was slaveryonthespot they called it colonialism both systems as is well known were conducted and perpetuated by the same people both systems are filled with such incredible callousness that they sound like cruel fairy tales the two systems have a lot in commona thing most historians have left untold first they were both designed to benefit the west economically slave trade to america was not only a gigantic commercial operation involving well over million lives but was a great help in financing both the english and french industrial revolutions as well as making possible the rise of the american plantation system colonialism on the other hand involved far more millions of lives provided the necessary raw material for the english and french industrial revolutions and helped finance the economic needs of the imperial powers in addtion to the small wars they fought among themselves as well as both world wars second both systems effectively excluded the blackman from participating in the formation of the political institutions that would control him even today some southern states of america still refuse to extend the rights to vote to the blacks there just as the preponderant majority of the blacks in rhodesia south africa mozambique angola and socalled portuguese guinea are denied the right to vote third both systems were founded on the firm belief that the white race is endowed with superiority over the damned blacks this feeling of superiority led the white man to treat the blackman with a paternalistic attitude in both systems fourth both systems were marked with inhumane torture inflicted upon the blacks by the whites sir hans sloane in reported that the slaves who committed major crimes were punished by nailing them down on the ground with crooked sticks on every limb and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands burning them gradually up to the head for crimes of a lesser nature gelding or chopping off half of the foot with an axe fifth the banner of christianity was held high in both systems before setting out on his voyages to hunt for slaves john hawkins always repeated his prayer serve god daily love one another preserve your victuals as if this was not enough he christened one of his slave ships jesus on the other hand the colonist always reminded himself of his threepoint mission to christianize to civilize and to trade he even traded his christianity for the africans land a story is told of the white man who came to africa with a bible in his hand and found the african on his land upon meeting the african the whiteman asked the african to close his eyes and let us pray by the time they said amen alas the african found the bible in his hand and his land was gone humourous as this may sound this is in fact what seems to have happened the list of similarities between the slave trade and colonialism can hardly be exhausted for the purpose of this paper however those that have been enumerated above will suffice the question to be asked is what kind of blackman emerged under each of the two systems we have already seen what happened to the african who was taken to america as a slave where he was turned into a negro by being stripped of his cultural identity the negrofied african american blackman lost the key to human dignity with human dignity lost no pride in the self was left consequently he did not only lose faith in himself and his fellowman but actually became ashamed of himself and worst of all hated himself because he hated himself he wanted to be like somebody else and the only somebody else there was to imitate was his master the white man the various shades of skin colorfrom the socalled highyellow to the quite black started distinguishing them intelligence no longer held the key to better opportunities but the shade of ones skin the lighter the skin the better the opportunities the white community employing the old machiavellian trick of divide and rule encouraged this to be lightskinned was not a source of shame for the extralegal integrationunderthe bedsheet activities between the black mother and the white master to be light was to be good to be acceptable to have a little dignitymaybe a little culture the nearer white one looked the better he felt is it any wonder therefore that the negrofied african wanted to make his hair look like the white mans he applied chemicals on his hair and burned it into a process or conk others chose to shave off all their hair or get the closest haircut possiblethey call it collegiate when i first came to this country i believed that all american black women grew straight hair naturally this belief stayed with me for four years until one rainy day a friend cancelled our dinner date with the excuse that the rain had turned her hair back some women even chose to dye their hair blond i have heard them referred to as congolese blonds i call this search for identityphase such are the manifestations of the shame afroamericans have been made to feel about themselves the manifestation of a crime worse than murderpsychic genocide if this is what happened to the black man brought to america what kind of an african emerged under the colonial system while the slavetrade completely m cut off the slave from his land thus denying him his culture onthespotslavery or colonialism allowed the colonist to decide which land the african was to occupy and which belonged to him the colonist the land distribution laws which colonialism introduced in most countries demanded the removal of the african from the most fertile and productive areas to the least productive areas the land issue probably disturbed the africans way of life more than any other single issue besides the inequity in the land distribution itself there was a sharp philosophical conflict between the two groups as to the concept of land the western colonialist regarded land as a marketable commodity while the african regarded it as a godgiven right to be communally owned to the african land and life were inseparable land was the only visible and tangible basis for sustenance and subsistence thus losing land was tantamount to losing life itself yet like it or not the land is a marketable commodity philosophy had to prevailbut not without fierce armed resistance from the africans once the land was distributed the colonialists got the better and larger share in proportion to their numerical numbers in rhodesia for instance the whites who constitute seven percent of the population own more than percent of the land the africans over percent of the population are forced to live on about percent of the landthis being die least fertile and poorly drained land once the land was taken the colonialists embarked upon the next stagethat of superimposing the european western cultures education and christianity were the two main channels used in imposing western culture on the african the education system was a direct carbon copy of that found in europe needless to say such a system was designed to deal with problems and further the interests of the imperial powers in biology the african had to learn herbs in england france portugal etc which are hardly relevant to his immediate environment this was true of other subjects today one will notice that the socalled educated african knows more about the history of europe than his own he can recite the stories of william and mary charles i and ii raleigh the mayflower napoleon the seven years war joan of arc the crusades etc with such accuracy it appears as if he were there ask him about his own history about the kingdoms of ghana songhai mali congo or zimbabwe and he will look at you as if you were crazy and if he knows anything about african history it is usually history in the version of the white colonialist just as the slave in america was made to be ashamed of his own history so was the african made to look negatively at his own past if education made the african direct his mind to europe christianity made him give up his whole selfthat is his customs values and religious beliefs christianity probably inflicted more harm on african culture than education as it involved more people while in most cases one had to be a christian in order to get an education since most of the schools were run by missionaries one did not have to be educated in order to be a christian the christian missionaries did not have the ability to separate the christian religion from western culture if indeed that is possible in the eyes of the missionaries everything african was pagan demonic or heathen to the missionary the african drum was filled with evil spirits so were the people who danced to the tunes african ways of worship said the missionary were pagan since the missionary could not understand it to him the african was worshiping his ancestors not knowing that he was worshiping through his ancestors to a higher being just as the missionary worshiped to god through jesus or the mohammedans through muhammed to allah without taking time to study and understand the african culture the missionary felt his divine mission was to wipe out the african way of life with the same conviction and vigor his brethren had fought the crusade wars thus once the african was enjoined to the christian family through the baptism ritual in the name of the father son and the holy spirit he had to change his whole way of life like the slave in america he had to change his name to a western name for the westerner this was civilization the average african believed it with education and christianity combining their forces to make a new african the end result was the emergence of a britishafrican frenchafrican portugueseafrican etc yet somehow there still remained an africanafrican the westernized african did not sever his native cultural ties completely this is virtually impossible for anybody to do just as the american black man became disillusioned when he found that he wasnt completely accepted by the white community no matter how american he felt the educated andor christianized african soon realized that the white communityincluding many if not most missionariesdid not accept him as an equal this led him to demand complete control of his own life to do this he had to control all those institutionspolitical economic social and cultural that affected his life and the lives of his people the inherent contradictions within the systems once they manifested themselves became dysfunctional to the system the rise of nationalism and the demand for political independence was a direct result of the disillusionment once disillusioned the african sought to give himself a definition of his own similar to the identity sought by the american blackman this second identity for the american blackman is in actuality a denial or a rebuff of the first while the search for identity phase i caused the negrofied african to be ashamed of himself physically and spiritually search for identity phase leads him not only to accept what he is but to be proud of it it is a search for soul it is what i call the denegrofication of the black man in america it is a sincere attempt to search for and develop cultural identity with the old country more and more american black men refuse to be referred to as negroes instead they choose to be called either blacks or afroamericans in other words as human beings they are africans cognizant and conscious of our common cultural heritage among the peoples of african origin throughout the world and are desirous of reviving and extending a dynamic interest in this heritage the roots of souv by william melvin kelley ne assumption about the blackman in the united states that no one seems to question is that he was completely cut off from africa and so is totally a product of european civilization that he is a black european as recently as the summer of i still believed this and wrote the negro was so completely cut loose from africa that next to nothing is left of it in his culture he is more completely american than anyone in this country not because as some say he has been here so long but because the american culture is the only culture he knows this was so i believed because i had been taught as have we all that the only way for a civilization to preserve itself is in books in terms of a written language the european in europe and the united states is always using the phrase since the beginning of recorded time he assumes that no one knows anything about what happened before that beginning and that the only way man can find out about before the beginning is to dig up something somewhere once anyone black or white accepts that principle the rest follows like grease when the european went into africa he didnt find any written language so immediately he assumed that african civilization was a stupid a primitive a subhuman civilization later after darwins theory of evolution he amended the wording slightly now we represented a lower stage of development but he meant the same thing primitive stupid and subhuman and all because we didnt have written languages but to decide that a civilization is subhuman because it has no written language is as silly as saying that one man is more subhuman than another simply because he cant write his name by the same principle within the ranks of the literate human distinctions would correspond to the quality of a mans handwriting the man who cannot write lives life as talkerlistener he may be missing something but we cant say that his life his experience is less human less valid than that of a man who can write his name quite simply he lives a different kind of life his experience is different and since experience moulds personality and culture two sets of experiences will mould different men and cultures after the european discovered africa decided to conquer it and did militarily at least he realized that he had conquered a different kind of man but then something and the european will have to figure out why and what snapped and instead of saying i am different from you and starting from there he said we are the same but i am better that was the end for him we were the same but lower he convinced himself that he had experienced in his own cultural past the same things that we were experiencing in his present he assumed that he knew us so we learned nothing about us instead of searching for the terms in which we defined ourselves he defined us in terms of himself and what he had he had a written language we did not we were subhuman if the european had looked for what we did have he would have discovered that instead of written languages and written traditions we had very complex oral languages and oral traditions for example the sentence a woman sitting on a bed sewing is crying in the ibo language of west africa becomes nwanyi no nenu akwa nakwa akwa nakwa akwa the ibo language is a tone language to make this clear suppose there are seven tones in speaking which correspond to seven notes in the key of c c through b if you sang nakwa to the notes eb it might mean sitting if you sang it to the notes fd it might mean crying add to this the possibilities o mood accents context rhythm and we have what the european calls a primitive language no wonder we didnt write them down it would take more than letters placed side by side to get the ibo language on paper in fact african writers trying to write in their own language are having just this problem they are working with tonic alphabets our oral tradition was as complex and sophisticated as our languages when the european was tucked away silently reading books which a person can only do alone africans were out in the world among all kinds of people talking to them learning from them arguing with them doing business with them talking women were passing cultural traditions in the stories they told their children men who healed the sick were instructing younger men artists were being trained in their cultures artistic principles knowledge of the past of the environment was being passed around not just within a lifetime but from one lifetime to the next spanning centuries and oceans on the boats which brought us to the united states we talked do you doubt it we did not waste time worrying about not possessing a written culture for the european not to bring we talked about where each of us had come from the beliefs and myths of that place the places each of us had been what he had done there we talked about our present situation and our probable future we did not sit in our chains silently we whispered do you doubt it an ibo and an ashanti chained together found a way to talk we created languages suited to our primary need survival gullah is an example of such a language in the united states bubba meaning brother is a gullah word cooler means turtle goober means peanut our oral tradition remained alive and with it africa in the united states it was not the africa of whofoughtwhoforwhat strange that the history of europe and the united states is the history of wars or exactly where we had come from or the exact languages we had spoken not history culture civilization as the european defines them it was instead the africa say of the kitchen an african woman may have cooked unseasoned meat and bland potatoes for her master but when she got some scraps from his table and took them back to her cabin she cooked the food she wanted to eat african with spice and pepper and she taught her daughter african cooking using what they had and her daughter taught her daughter and that daughter cooks african food in a little diner in the middle of harlem today i have eaten proof of what i say in many an african students hotel room tender pepperhot meat onions greens and the rice the rice or dont take the cooking take the christianity of the blackman in the united states the european thinks that we believe in his religion he thinks that we believe in his god and his gods son but the evidence shows that we believe in our god our god likes some good music in his church he likes some people to go into trance and talk tongues different people different gods and if our concept of god is different from the europeans the difference must originate in africa where else and our music wherever africans survived in what the european likes to call the new world despite the redman having been on the continent for at least years we find our music in jamaica it is called calypso in cuba guaguanco in brazil samba in the united states jazz terrible word and when we in the united states hear calypso guaguanco or samba dont we know it is our music we dance to all of it our music is perhaps the best example of how the oral tradition preserved africa in the united states any black musician ive ever met or heard about has emphasized personal contact oral contact musical contact with another musician as an important aspect of his musical development clifford brown played with max roach who played with dizzy who played with roy eldridge louis armstrong played with king oliver who played with buddy bolden who played with a blackman who played with a blackman who played with a musician who before his abrupt arrival in the united states had played on some trumpetlike instrument in ashantiland the european in the united states tells us that our music is american have we ever believed that has any european been an innovator or practitioner of our music on an equal level with james brown duke ellington thelonious monk coleman hawkins lester young charlie parker leadbelly or sonny rollins and others this is not because of any inherent weakness in the european in the united sates he is simply not in the african oral mainstream he does not get the right information it did not have to be that way elsewhere in the hemisphere we can see that african and european have mixed culturally racially that africa has spread to a great many people but in those other places the nature of the oppression was different from that which we faced because the europeans practicing it were different than our european historians have shown the difference between catholic and protestant slavery or french and spanish slavery or both of these and english slavery what our european did was to segregate us from himself and at the same time lump us together he really should have kept our tribes apart chained ibo to ibo promoted tribal animosity within the united states as he does today in africa encouraged each tribe to compete for his favor but instead seeing us all as subhuman as inferior he did not bother to distinguish between us and so lumped us together giving us at least one common experience and enemy then he pushed us away he erected a social institution which would save him from contamination so doing he robbed himself of african civilization not to say that he didnt steal parts of it without really understanding it james brown is not elvis presley the five stair steps are not the beatles and he created a situation in which he would not contaminate us now we begin to see our true situation in the united states because african civilization was an oral rather than a written civilization each adult african who arrived in the united states possessed an enormous body of knowledge about himself his history traditions and customs knowledge which could not be destroyed as long as he lived and talked each african sifted through his experience his knowledge trying to find something to help him survive in his new environment and he was talking he asked other africans other slaves sons of africans picking up different kinds of knowledge sharing experience finally the tribes the cultures the newcomers and oldtimers mixed and what has emerged is not a culture with nothing of africa in it but rather a panafrican culture but the europeans did not see this he saw instead a universe with himself at the center a few steps down the ladder from his god he had a written language he had machines he owned things like guns people and books which told him that his culture his civilization was the greatest most advanced that the world had ever known until the th century his maps told him that the world was flat his philosophers told him that if a man made money it was evidence that god had blessed him with a soul that was predestined to go to heaven we couldnt read or writebut we knew where china was chinese plates have been found in the congo dating from before marco polo a boatload of chinese arrived on the shores of what is now kenya ages before the european moslems in the camerouns and nigeria knew where mecca was egypt knew where israel was ghanaians may have known the incas and where california now is some africans knew where rome was their pictures are in the mosaic tile bathrooms at pompeii but the european looked at us and saw cheap labor cotton tobacco money heaven a black cain killing a white abel and being driven from the garden of eden or later as a lower level on the evolutionary scale fish amphibian reptile mammal ape nigger man european civilization we did not possess a written language because we hadnt evolved to it yet we had no books and couldnt remember anything but even in the united states away from that place the european was certain we had forgotten and locked away from his library a group of africans finished working played some drums told innocent stories about weak rabbits big dumb bears crafty foxes sang songs danced talked and everywhere the european sees evidence of africa in the united states youre damn right hes scared brother the eloquent legacy of a doomed african freedom fighter by toivo herman ja toivo lord we find ourj h selves here in a foreign ml country convicted ungj der laws made by people whom we have always considered as foreigners we find ourselves tried by a judge who is not our countryman and who has not shared our background aer iaws maae y peo when this case started counsel tried to show that this court had no jurisdiction to try us what they had to say was of a technical and legal nature the reasons may mean little to some of us but it is the deep feeling of all of us that we should not be tried here in pretoria you my lord decided that you had the right to try us because your parliament gave you that right that ruling has not and could not have changed our feelings we are namibians and not south africans we do not now and will not in the future recognize your right to govern us to make laws for us in which we had no say to treat our country as if it were your property and us as if you were our masters we have always regarded south africa as an intruder in our country this is how we have always felt and this is how we feel now and it is on this basis that we have faced this trial i speak of we because i am trying to speak not only for myself but for others as well and especially for those of my fellow accused who have not had the benefit of any education i think also that when i say we the overwhelming majority of nonwhite people in south west africa would like to be included we are far away from our homes not a single member of our families has come to visit us never mind be present at our trial the pretoria jail the police headquarters at compol where we were interrogated and where statements were extracted from us and this court is all we have seen of pretoria we have been cut off from our people and the world we all wondered whether the headmen would have repeated some of their lies if our people had been present in court to hear them the south african government has again shown its strength by detaining us for as long as it pleased keeping some of us in solitary confinement for to days and bringing us to its capital to try us it has shown its strength by passing an act especially for us and having it made retrospective ihas even chosen an ugly name to call us by ones own are called patriots or at least rebels your opponents are called terrorists a court can only do justice in political cases if it understands the position of those that it has in front of it the state has not only wanted to convict us but also to justify the policy of the south african government we will not even try to present the other side of the picture because we know that a court has not suffered in the same way as we have can not understand us this is perhaps why it is said that one should be tried by ones equals we have felt from the very time of our arrest that we were not being i tried by our equals but by our masters and that those who have brought us to trial very often do not even do us the courtesy of calling us by our surnames had we been tried by our equals it would not have been necessary to have any discussion about grievances they would have been known to those set to judge us it suits the government of south africa to say that it is ruling south west africa with the consent of the people this is not true our organization south west african peoples organization swapo is the largest political organization in south west africa we consider ourselves a political party we know that whites do not think of blacks as politiciansonly as agitators many of our people through no fault qf their own have had no education at all this does not mean that they do not know what they want a man does not have to be formally educated to know that he wants to live with his family where he wants to live and not where an official chooses to tell him to live to move about freely and not require a pass to earn a decent wage to be free to work for the person of his choice for as long as he wants and finally to be ruled by the people that he wants to be ruled by and not those who rule him because they have more guns than he has our grievances are called socalled grievances we do not believe south africa is in south west africa in order to provide facilities and work for nonwhites it is there for its own selfish reasons for the first years it did practically nothing to fulfill its sacred trust it only concerned itself with the welfare of the whites since because of the pressure from inside by the nonwhites and especially my organization and because of the limelight placed on our country by the world south africa has been trying to do a bit more it rushed the bantustan report so that it would at least have something to say at the world court only one who is not white and has suffered the way we have can say whether our grievances are real or socalled those of us who have some education together with our uneducated brethren have always struggled to get freedom the idea of our freedom is not liked by south africa it has tried in this court to prove through the mouths of a couple of its paid chiefs and a paid official that swapo does not represent the people of south west africa if the government of south africa were sure that swapo did not represent the innermost feelings of the people in south west africa it would not have taken the trouble to make it impossible for swapo to advocate its peaceful policy south african officials want to believe that swapo is an irresponsible organization and that it is an organization that resorts to the level of telling people not to get vaccinated as much as white south africans may want to believe this this is not swapo we sometimes feel that is what the government would like swapo to be it may be true that some member or even members of swapo somewhere refused to do this the reason for such refusal is that some people in our part of the world have lost confidence in the governors of our country and they are not prepared to accept even the good that they are trying to do your government my lord undertook a very special responsibility when it was awarded the mandate over us after the first world war it assumed a sacred trust to guide us toward independence and to prepare us to take our place among the nations of the world we believe that south africa has abused that trust because of its belief in racial supremacy that white people have been chosen by god to rule the world and apartheid we believe that for years south africa has failed to promote the development of our people where are our trained men the wealth of our country has been used to train your people for leadership and the sacred duty of preparing the indigenous people to take their place among the nations of the world has been ignored i know of no case in the last years of a parent who did not want his child to go to school if the facilities were available but even if as it was said a small percentage of parents wanted their children to look after cattle i am sure that south africa was strong enough to impose its will on this as it has done in so many other respects to us it has always seemed that our rulers wanted to keep us backward for their benefit nineteen sixtythree for us was to be the year of our freedom from it looked as if south africa could not oppose the world forever the world is important to us in the same way as all laughed in court when they heard that an old man tried to bring down a helicopter with a bow and arrow we laughed when south africa said that it would oppose the world we knew that the world was divided but as time went on it at least agreed that south africa had no right to rule us i do not claim that it is easy for men of different races to live at peace with one another i myself had no experience of this in my youth and at first it surprised me that men of different races could live together in peace but now i know it to be true and to be something for which we must strive the south african government creates hostility by separating people and emphasizing their differences we believe that by living together people will learn to lose their fear of each other we also believe that this fear which some of the whites have of africans is based on their desire to be superior and privileged and that when whites see themselves as part of south west africa sharing with us all its hopes and troubles then that fear will disappear separation is said to be a natural process but why then is it imposed by force and why then is it that whites have the superiority headmen are used to oppress us this is not the first time that foreigners have tried to rule indirectlywe know that only those who are prepared to do what their masters tell them become headmen most of those who had some feeling for their people and who wanted independence have been intimidated into accepting the policy from above their guns and sticks are used to make people say they support them i have come to know that our people cannot expect progress as a gift from anyone be it the united nations or south africa progress is something we shall have to struggle and work for and i believe that the only way in which we shall be able and fit to secure that progress is to learn from our own experience and mistakes your lordship emphasized in your judgment the fact that our arms come from communist countries and also that words commonly used by communists were to be found in our documents but my lord in the documents produced by the state there is another type of language it appears even more often than the former many documents finish up with an appeal to the almighty to guide us in our struggle for freedom it is the wish of the south african government that we should be discredited in the western world this is why it calls our struggle a communist plot but this will not be believed by the world the world knows that we are not interested in ideologies we feel that the world as a whole has a special responsibility towards us this is because the land of our fathers was handed over to south africa by a world body it is a divided world but it is a matter of hope for us that it at least agrees about one thingthat we are entitled to freedom and justice other mandated territories have received their freedom the judgment of the world court was a bitter disappointment to us we felt betrayed and we believed that south africa would never fulfill its trust some felt that we would secure our freedom only by fighting for it we knew that the power of south africa is overwhelming but we also knew that our cause is a just one and our situation intolerablewhy should we not also receive our freedom we are sure that the worlds efforts to help us in our plight will continue whatever south africans may call us we do not expect that independence will end our troubles but we do believe that our people are entitledas are all peoplesto rule themselves it is not really a question of whether south africa treats us well or badly but that south west africa is our country and we wish to be our own masters there are some who will say that they are sympathetic with our cause but unwilling to condone violence i would answer that i am not by nature a man of violence and i believe that violence is a sin against god and my fellow man swapo itself was a nonviolent organization but the south african government is not truly interested in whether opposition is violent or nonviolent it does not wish to hear any opposition to apartheid since swapo meetings have been banned it is true that it is the tribal authorities who have done so but they worked with the south african government which has never lifted a finger in favor of political freedom we have found ourselves voteless in our own country and deprived of the right to meet and state our own political opinions is it surprising that in such times my countrymen have taken up arms violence is truly fearsome but who would not defend his property and himself against a robber and we believe that south africa has robbed us of our country i have spent my life working in swapo which is an ordinary political party like any other suddenly we in swapo found that a war situation had arisen and that our colleagues and south africa were facing each other in the field of battle although i had not been responsible for organizing my people militarily and although i believed we were unwise to fight the might of south africa while we were so weak i could not refuse to help them when the time came my lord you found it necessary to brand me a coward during the second world war when it became evident that both my country and your country were threatened by the dark clouds of nazism i risked my life for both of them wearing a uniform with orange bands on it but some of your countrymen when called to battle to defend civilization resorted to sabotage against their own fatherland i volunteered to face german bullets and as a guard of military installations both in south west africa and the republic was prepared to be the victim of their sabotage today they are our masters and are considered the heroes and i am called the coward when i consider my country i am proud that my countrymen have taken up arms for their people and i believe that anyone who calls himself a man would not despise them in the african national congress anc and pan africanist congress pac in south africa were suppressed this convinced me that we were too weak to face south africas force by waging battle when some of my countrys soldiers came back i foresaw the trouble there would be for swapo my people and me personally i tried to do what i could to prevent my people from going into the bush in my attempts i became unpopular with some of my people but this too i was prepared to face decisions of this kind are not easy to make my loyalty is to my country my organization could not work properly it could not even hold meetings i had no answer to the question where has your nonviolence got us whilst the world court judgment was pending i at least had that to fall back on when we failed after years of waiting i had no answer to give to my people even though i did not agree that people should go into the bush i could not refuse to help them when i knew that they were hungry i even passed on the request for dynamite it was not an easy decision another man might have been able to say i will have nothing to do with that sort of thing i was not and i could not remain a spectator in the struggle of my people for their freedom i am a loyal namibian and i could not betray my people to their enemies i admit that i decided to assist those who had taken up arms i know that the struggle will be long and bitter i also know that my people will wage that struggle whatever the cost only when we are granted our independence will the struggle stop only when our human dignity is restored to us as equals of the whites will there be peace between us we believe that south africa has a choiceeither to live at peace with us or to subdue us for force if you choose to crush us and impose your will on us then you not only betray your trust but you will live in security for only so long as your power is greater than ours no south african will live at peace in south west africa for each will know his security is based on force and that without force he will face rejection by the people of south west africa my coaccused and i have suffered we are not looking forward to our imprisonment we do not however feel that our efforts and sacrifice have been wasted we believe that human suffering has its effect even on those who impose it we hope that what has happened will persuade the whites of south africa that we and the world may be right and they may be wrong only when white south africans realize this and act on it will it be possible for us to stop our struggle for freedom and justice in the land of our birth editors note the statement on the previous pages was taken from the congressional record where it was published at the behest of representative barrett ohara of illinois the following paragraphs prefaced mr toivos statement in the record representative barrett ohara of illinois asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the congressional record and to include extraneous matter mr ohara of illinois mr speaker we who are so fortunate as to live in a land where our legal rights and civil liberties are protected and cherished sometimes need reminding of our blessings we who enjoy freedom of speech and representative government may forget that there are people elsewhere in the world less fortunate often they are forced to suffer in silence but occasionally the veil is lifted a trifle and a voice is heard crying out for help for the afflicted this happened recently in pretoria where southwest africans have been charged by south africa under an act so unjust that it offends accepted civilized legal principles and grossly violates the universal declaration of human rights one of the defendants mr toivo herman ja toivo after being pronounced guilty addressed the court in mitigation of sentence he made such an eloquent statement that i am placing it in the record it captures the essence of his plight a plight which this government has repeatedly protested his is the plea of a people struggling to be free unfortunately his plea so far has had little effect on the south african government on february the judge sentenced mr toiva to years in jail and others to life imprisonment we can only hope that the censure of world opinion might yet persuade the government of south africa in the direction of clemency toward our freedom by keorapetse kgositsile must be deniggerfied demystified images to shape us black as men values but we must clearly understand that the questions of identity and nationalism are even at their utmost best a means not an end a good beginning in order for racial dominajwj j m tion to be successful the racist oppressor had to create in us selfdoubt and feelings of insecurity finally selfdespise when we understand this contradiction we will be better able to understand why the liberation struggle in africa mobilizes the people by awakening nationalist passions and why afroamericans rally around identity in colonial africa the peoples identity has remained relatively intact because the oppressor never pretended to assimilate us he attempted to crush our pride as african nationals he made us feel inadequate and weak as africans so it is as africans with a rediscovered pride after rejecting the distorted image of ourselves which colonial institutions had programmed us into that we begin our fight for liberation in america however particularly in the north the peoples identity is continually being damaged by the oppressors use of hypocritical rhetoric and bogus legislationbales of rosetinted cotton over the eyes of gullible subjects the vocabulary of the black mans experience in america is contaminated with terms like integration meltingpot society civil_rights which are nothing but ways of destroying the black victims identity to ensure his psychological captivity and his alienation from himself thus it is that the question of identity among afroamericans is of primary importance as a first step towards liberatory struggle identity and nationalism then are simply strategic points of reference in our struggle for liberation the world is on fire and we do not want to be scorched with the evil maniacs who throw napalm bombs on innocent children and unless values move us we deserve worse than death how does a thing mean if it doesnt move i know numerous south africans believe me who run around the world searching for a good white man in a desperate attempt to stop themselves from coming to grips with the only rational conditions under which we have to get our land back invariably though this captive searches between white thighs and finds the dollar or whatever currency extremely irresisti ble to say i have had enough of this be the this the most hideous kind of oppression and not do anything about itand not movedoes not amount to anv w thing we must move to create in concrete ways images of a livable world centuries of colonial domination moved and with them the oppressors chains from our wrists and ankles to our minds and soul raped but the slime remains invisible to the victims eye let us be sensitive to what is around us what we are into the selfavowed nationalist in black communities in the northern sectors of the united states reacting to the white oppressor calls me an african brother if african brother was strictly descriptive of place of birth there would be nothing to be worried about but there is this attitude behind african brother i am a brother however i am still a foreigner an outsider again a subconscious acceptance of the psychological boundaries created by the oppressor but in a black community in the south say in alabama i am not any more of a foreigner than my brother from harlem after the initial excitement over my being african i am simply another black man from another community and the alabama brother or sister might never have heard of nationalism or revolution divide and rulelets get to it the african on the other hand in most cases he is a student here comes on like some missionary afraid of the savagery of the natives often paternalistic and contemptuous in his dealings with afroamericans he is afraid to go up to harlem because these negroes are so rough and negroes are ashamed of us anyway they say we come from the jungle and i even know of an african statesman who told students from his country that if they married in america please do not take a nigger home if anything better look for a nice white girl raped but the slime remains invisible to the victims eye the white oppressor tells us that we do not like each other that we do not have anything in common and we accept the nonsense and affirm it without even realizing that we have been put in a trick because we do not look beyond the superficial appearance i concede that the relations between the african and other people of african descent are not what they could and should be we must not pretend that this does not exist because that way we could not possibly cure the sickness we must see the trick bag and understand why the oppressor found it necessary to put us in it then together we must let it go up in flames scorching to death the veiled oppressor hand twisting us around like puppets we have to start with a total rejection of the oppressor and his ways there is a tendency among us when we become disillusioned with the oppressors rhetoric the whiteman is not man enough to fulfill his promises we eventually realize to reject the oppressor and replace our former naive faith in his word with unguided hatred this rejection however has often turned out to be the most complete kind of acceptance of the oppressor because this disillusioned man often ends up assuming the role of the oppressor twisted and lacking in commitment to the people he does not even realize that his overt hatred is finally a manifestation of his envy for the oppressors bloodstained acquisitions there is the angry black artist who devotes his efforts to telling white people how immoral and inhuman they are because they do not love him and he has contempt for his people because they are ignorant and poorbut he does nothing to enlighten them there is the ambitious businessman who is against white businesses in black communities but as a superprofit motivated businessman he exploits his people as readily and as much as his white rival would and does there is the civil servant of the newly independent nation who is fascinated i believe by the glamour of his new position which used to be exclusively for the oppressor his concept of social change goes no farther than that there are black faces in the cabinet instead of white ones everything else remains as it was during the colonial period and the chains wax tighter around the mind heralding a coup a nephew of a prominent african political figure invited lindsay barrett the writer and i to dinner one day he would clap his hands for service and an elderly man old enough to be his grandfather whom he couldnt summon enough courage to look in the face would come in from the kitchen to see what master wanted this threatened my appetite and i asked our host to stop his performance there are probably a lot of things you do not like about the situation in our country he said as we got ready to leave but please dont write anything bad about it if you will still be writing in another ten years there will be some changes and you will have plenty of good things to write about i just shook my head in frustrated condemnation of the mentality of our bourgeoisie yesterdays victim turns villain today with comfort at our expense by this simply to point out that exploitation by a black capitalist elite is not less hideous than exploitation by a white racist oppressor after the bloodshed after the coups and countercoups inevitably builtin in almost every struggle against the oppressor after the oppressor is forced to hand over the government to the fighting colonial subject after the national independence celebrations and even babies learn to speak by singing the new national anthem we shall still be quite a long way from freedom because freedom is not an experience nor is freedom the physical absence of the white oppressor freedom is an attitude a complex of emotional and psychological responsesconscious and subconscioustowards life shaped and determined by the values a people lives by in harmony with other peoples and nature freedom and with it liberation is socialistic in nature socialistic because the purposeaim is the greatest good for the greatest number not as unattainable ideal but as an actual mode of living panafricanism or african unity seems today in to be more removed from our reach than it was in why i suggest that our lack of a clear understanding of our contradictions led to this we relied upon the influence of external forces for our unity black people suffered under white oppression and it was on opposition to white oppression that we based our unity after political independence and the oppressor was no longer thereby this to mean no more than white faces in administrative and civil service jobs were replaced by black onesapparently we were left without a great need for unity our unity should be something we desire something we fashion regardless of the presence or absence of the oppressor our unity should be based upon positive attitudes towards our future something to be proud of our unity should be a positive act by us and for us instead of a mere protest or reaction against white domination its common factor more noble than oppression to speak of a movement towards freedom and unity without a clear understanding of our goals could not possibly change our condition significantly and the africanity of the oau organization of african unity is still very questionableask brother julius nyerere selfreliance selfdetermination destination and road woven inseparably every inch of the way and when we fail and fall into the claws of neocolonialism the fault is with us the road to liberation starts with resolving our national contradictions mwalimu nyerere is a committed teacher we have a great deal to learn from him he teaches us that our basic requirements are hard work and intelligence he teaches us that we cannot depend upon gifts loans and investments from foreign countries and foreign companies because there is no way of doing that without endangering our independence let us therefore always remember the following he says in the arusha declaration we have made a mistake to choose money something which we do not have to be our major instrument of development we are mistaken when we imagine that we shall get money from foreign countries firstly because to say the truth we cannot get enough money for our development and secondly because even if we could get it such complete dependence on outside help would have endangered our independence and the other policies of our country the development of a country is brought about by people not by money money and the wealth it represents is the result and not the basis of development in order to maintain our independence and our peoples freedom we ought to be selfreliant in every possible way and avoid depending upon other countries for assistance if every individual is selfreliant the house cell will be selfreliant if all the cells are selfreliant the whole ward will be selfreliant and if the wards are selfreliant the district will be selfreliant if the districts are selfreliant then the region is selfreliant and if the regions are selfreliant then the whole nation is self reliant and this is our aim demystified indeed in deed then we must build and be productive for our salvation we rhave to build attitudes we have to build men and women fearless souls we have to build model famm ilies to build model communities to produce societies with values fashioning a life worth living we have to build our own economies inde pendent of whatever hideous devil is threatened by our attitudes and ways there will be some movement then and we will be rebuilding every individual man in our communities wherever he is never insensitive to his roots replenishing our collective energy and resources our lives then rhythm of a purposeful direction all things falling into place natural and desirable freedom is an attitude our values clearly patterning our actions and reactions the most valid song of our life unity and selfreliance the national anthem sung by the way we live wherever we live knowing no rest until our life flows like a poem loving the lovable we must create more of it destroying the detestable knowing what we be by mari evans here is the possibility t that you are living more precariously than you know consider largely unreported by most newspaper accounts of miss eartha kitts controversial white house encounter was her alleged avowal that she spoke not as a negro but as an american you see during a writers conference a black student in a black sociology class at a black college wailed passionately i think of myself as a citizen of one worldnot a negro an yearold high school dropout stood with me in the pathetically bare confines of a recreation room in the heart of a ghetto the tiny area empty except for a battered piano and some equally battered wooden folding chairs had been provided by a poverty action program in weak hope that it would serve to subvert adolescent leanings toward violence he was a reluctant and somewhat suspiciousminded conversationalist riot not him he wasnt liable to get hisself shot at or his head beat in okay now tell me this if you needed socks where would you buy them the project shopping center housed variety storesone blackowned one whiteowned at the first one i got to probably the white one why oohhhhi dont have no prejudice there are more gems the wounded black serviceman on day leave from vietnam who castigated me when i mentioned having participated in peace demonstrations he lectured on the dangers of communism and i incredulous could not get in a word about the various virulent forms of american fascism wallaceism reaganism welchism et al there was the black civic leader whitesubsidized and nationally acclaimed for her block clubs and nobeerdrinkinginpublic policies who said on a local tvcast if you can teach them and you know who them is to be good citizens all else will follow chuckling dont if there are million of us i lay you odds give or take a few hundred thousand that million of us stand with proudly palpitating hearts and add our rich natural rhythms to the star spangled banner proudly proclaiming for whiteys approval i am an american first and a negro second this is in the category of the jews classic we are germans first and jews later many of those good white lawabiding german citizens were still singing this refrain halfway to belsen and dachau and they learned the answer to the ancient riddle paraphrased of which came firstgerman citizenship or jewishnessin the shower rooms of auschwitz and treblinka you are a black person first baby and youd better remember it consider the unique position of the jews in prenazi europe families such as the rothschilds weinmanns the petscheks controlled vast properties and were deeply involved in international finance jews owned steel corporations coal mines textile mills they had extensive real estate holdings they owned banks chemical firms and big business establishments as well as a plethora of small enterprises in fact years ago jewish money formed if not the backbone of the economic structure of europe a significant portion of its strength if that were not enough the jews had a racial bank of academic scientific technical and professional skills which may have surpassed any accumulation we as a race presently possess in poland they were the intelligentsia who even in the squalid ghettos to which they were driven maintained a cultural existence just prior to the nazi occupation there were jewish daily newspapers jewish weeklies and a total of jewish periodicals in poland alone and one survivors account of the vilna poland ghetto mentions the activities of a symphony two choirs and a literary group which held a series of literary evenings and organized literary competitions they were an incredible people these jews their contributions to their society cannot be argued add then the factor which should have insured their assimilation and more or less assured their acceptance as firstclass citizens in a white majority culture they were whiteskinned many millions of them could and on the face of it did disappear within the structure of german societyleaving only a ripple to mark the spot where they m discarded their jewishness for the greater glory of assimilation the people who appreciated this allegiance least according to the mountains of documents and photographs which recorded years of systematic jewish extermination were the good german citizens themselves one chronicler of the nazi holocaust said aside from the indispensable fact of its minority status long in the land deeply in and of its culture a familiar of its political and scientific thoroughfares yet racially distinct the jew was a german and he was not of the exact proportion of identity and difference he provided the perfect object for a transference of guilt it is tragic and ironic that the very effort of the jew to be assimilated into the german genus betrayed him most completely into the hands of his enemies even in early childhood mimicry is recognized as a stimulus for rage it is argued that in mimicry one may perceive ones own flaws in another and strike out against them with no pain to the ego with our high degree of black visibility we wisely substitute the word integration for the word assimilation but we mean the same thing the jews meant yes these were incredible people the jews incredibly wealthy incredibly knowledgeable incredibly blind for if their destruction as individuals can be attributed to any single factor it must surely be this their refusal to think and act as a racial group safe in their citizenship and motivated by their need to be accepted and assimilated by the germans they tried not to think of themselves as jews preferring instead to be known as good germansuntil the dominant german society legislated away this dubious privilege in shortthey were voted out of the club baby you say it cant happen here do you know how many black men we have in congress fiveof a total of you dont make the laws baby you are governed by them your secure status as an american citizen can be affected at the drop of an executive order as was the case in february when occasioned by necessity the word can be equated with public hysteria president roosevelt signed executive order no which set the stage for the internment of thousands of yellowskinned americans after pearl harbor american indignation focused with mounting fury on its yellowskinned citizens despite their complete lack of responsibility for and involvement with the attack as a matter of fact most of the japanese finally imprisoned in camps for their own safety and for the public good maintained their loyalty and allegiance to their country throughout their imprisonmentgoing to such unbelievable extremes as to accept menial employment under guard outside the camps to hold bond drives within the camps and to volunteer for service in the armed forces ironically the famed nisei th infantry battalion a segregated unit composed primarily of japaneseamericancitizens was the most decorated american outfit in world war ii the fear which consumed white americans at the time was fear that other american citizens persons they thought of as yellowskinned first and citizens second would violently take over the government they were in short afraid of yellow power and this is the mood of the country at the moment possibly the position of the blackskinned american citizenwho contrary to the placid lawabiding japanese has said hell no we wont go to viet nam and who has burned thfc white mans cities looted his stores and demonstrated a frightening ability to proceed with a degree of singlemindedness toward an objective to follow the japanese without any previously established guilt on their part and as a preventive measure and in the interest of national security these citizens were summarily relocated in remote and arid wastelands hundreds of miles from their neat gardens their ranchstyle homes their red trs that they might comply with public law passed in by the congress of the united states to support the presidents executive order japanese businesses were closed farms placed in governmental custody belongings sold stored or destroyed homes locked and they with what possessions they could hurriedly throw in barracks bags and suitcases were bussed to their new homes an armed caucasian soldier sat in the front of each bus america is a christian country when discussing the imprisonment and immobilization of of its slanteyed yellowskinned citizens it utilized a word with christian overtones evacuation evacuation implies a necessary but christian and merciful actwhen in actual fact to the doctors lawyers cooks gardeners housewives scientists students children who were evacuated from a correspondingly wide range of socioeconomic conditions to hastilv constructed wooden barracks and hastily petitioned and whitewashed horse barns still odorous it was a nightmare all the more horrible for its reality the semantics of prisoners versus evacuees need not be argued hitler was more direct early in he avowed we shall have to develop a technique of depopulation i mean the removal of entire racial units one writer states the devious practice of arresting jews ostensibly for their own safety began about that time the relocation of nisei was not americas first experiment in depopulation nor is germany the only western country that has placidly watched the extermination of a race ask the american indiancitizen emeritus you who are flagwaving americans first and negroes only because you cant close your eyes every time you look in the mirror remember the jews and the nisei and if vou can handle it the indians the american indian cant happen to you i wouldnt say that you may not take wallace reagan and welch seriously babv but there are a whole lot of j good white american citizens who do and thev vote how could it come about easily the first steps have already been taken in a congress which had onlv one black member passed public law which underwrote a wide extension of presidential authority supplied criminal penalties for the enforcement of partly unspecified military orders and approved a program which would immediately deprive on the basis of race an entire group of americans of their fundamental civil_rights even more important than pl was the supreme court decision which followed its review of the japanese affair after hearing two cases one contesting the legality of the curfew imposed on a single ethnic group japanese and the other contesting the legality of the imprisonment itself the court hearing both cases long after the events declared both the curfew and the evacuation constitutional civil liberties are not absolute matters when liberties come into conflict with pressing public necessities liberties must give way whatever its shortcomings the famous holmes criterion of clear and present danger has in recent years been the most frequently utilized test of the us supreme court in determining the legality of civil liberties deprivations when the larger public stands in clear and present danger as the result of exercise of traditional liberties then one has no right to those liberties the magnitude of the civil liberties deprivation must be judged in terms of the threat to the common welfare in one of the dissenting opinions mr justice murphy said the evacuation fell into the ugly abyss of racism continuing he said that the true test of evacuation was whether the civil liberties deprivation was reasonably related to a public danger that is so immediate imminent and impending as not to admit of delay and not to permit the intervention of ordinary constitutional processes to alleviate the danger the oncoming summer may provide just such a climateand there is obviously constitutional precedent for wholesale incarceration on the basis of race alone in the event the larger public feels it is in clear and present danger and you know who the larger public is the mccarran internal security act aimed ostensibly at subversives further compounds the legal web which is being spun while you watch the act passed in by a congress which had two black members empowers a single person to declare an internal security emergency this catchall term can obviously be applied to any insurrection or civil_rights demonstrationcertainly to all areas in which rioting looting and violence are imminent or in progress and under title ii of the mccarran act six sites in america have been designated as detention camps to receive an intern detainees in the event such an emergency occurs the camps presentlv in varying states of repair and disrepair use and disuse are allenwood pa avon park fla el reno okla wickenburg ariz florence ariz and newell calif several of the camps are technically closed despite some evidence of maintenance others are being used for penal or other purposes very little is known about actual ownership of the avon land with that possible exception the us government has the right of immediate reentry by rozina rajan nyone who goes to africa is bound to hear the music and v to notice that it is different from western music what may not be noticed is that the individual performer has complete freedom for his own individual and inspired variation within fixed limits provided he keeps to the main rules an african performer may introduce as many subtle variations as he pleasesand all conceived on the spur of the moment it is spontaneous music one never hears the same song done exactly the same way when the african makes music what exactly does he do much research is being done on this subject even today and though we know much more about african music no one has yet been able to catch the essence of the african musicand this for many reasons transcribing the musicthe tempo of african music is fairly fast judged by western standards the average speed of drumming is seven unit beats per second this would be manageable if african music were susceptible to regular time bars time and so on but it is not the african approach to rhythm is largely additive and so one is confronted with a series of rhythmic motifs of everchanging timelength which can only be intelligibly set down in a series of bars of continually changing value the only way possible to capture these rhythms is to devise some apparatus which will write down on a moving strip of paper every beat made by each instrument at the instant it is made recording on a gramophone and with a tape machine have failed to accurately measure the distance of one note from another besides this one has to discover the rhythms themselves and the musical pitch of each drum beat when the africans beat drums they play tunes on their drums therefore rhythm and time both have to be transcribed these are difficult to compare with the spontaneous creations of the master drummer at the very moment he plays them the social setting of the music has to be considered before the music as a whole can be said to have been mastered this is difficult when determining the rhythm of the song in a dance and its incidence with the other instruments such is the unity of the african music with african social life drumming and dancing are the center and climax of african music and it is necessary to pay attention to features of musical topology to the relation between speechtone and melody in singing because each tribe possesses its own musical idiosyncrasies it is very hard to transcribe african music so far i have tried to point out from my own experience and from the viewpoints of other musicologists why african music is a new field and why no one has yet been able to transcribe authoritatively its essence i have used the drum as an example because that is the first instrument that is heard in african music of any tribe another difficulty encountered in the transcribing of the african music is its norm the full ensemble of the dance all other forms of music are secondary the full ensemble consists of the instruments of the orchestra the handclapping the song and the dance these four ingredients combine to form the central act of african musicmaking in the full performance with singing and drumming we have the flower of african musical genius the highest manifestation of the art and the most spontaneously creative expression of the soul of music different tribes use different instruments but almost all use drums beneath all this diversity lies a unity of attitude to the dance for a large part of the african continent there are two fundamental principles of african music with special reference to handclapping and the accompanying songs the rhythm the melody the scoring of the drums the tuning and finally the instruments of the african orchestra are separately treated but one must remember that all these go together to give that mysterious and spiritual element to african music as to the religious element in african music almost all musicologists believe that africans had clearcut concepts of the role of music in life music permeates virtually every important phase of living in africa from birth to death singing related to religious activity had a specific character and specific requirements most africans had their own concepts of a supreme though not necessarily exclusive deity in many instances this deity tended to be somewhat remote and the africans dealingssupplicative invocational and placativewere with lesser supernatural beings many of whom had epic histories those who served these deities sang songs of praise much of the oral religious literature of the african consisted less of prayers as we think of them than of dramatic statements in the form of songs relating to the deities this is also very true of indian music and dance which originated in the form of prayers to the gods however the two fundamental principles of african music are the tunebackground of the music be it handclap or a pestlebeat or a swish of the paddles in a canoesong or whatever the rhythmic background the melody of the song attaches each syllable to its appropriate note that is the words and the time are inseparable handclapping is a normal way of providing percussive effect and maintaining a rhythmic pulse for singinga musical device of african derivation it is used in most childrens ring games and playparty songs clapping beat may or may not coincide with melodic accents often the clapping sounds fall squarely between the stressed voice tones and constitute a regular offbeat natalie curtis in her songs and tales from the dark continent has been able to transcribe correctly the wide spread african clap or bell pattern which might well be described as the african signature time and which is this she has noted down the time accurately but has not recognized its rhythm here is an example to illustrate the variety in african musical phrases the songfor girls the agbada river has caught me o i say that the todzie river has caught me o they say the wind on the lagoon has caught me o people should rescue me and may god guide me the song is the game the children form a ring the cantor starts the song and the chorus joins in all clap hands with a slow stroking movement moving their bodies too but without shifting their ground the musicthe song is common time throughout the claps fall on the first beat of each bar the song consists of claps it is not bars because it is the claps which are the timebackbone of the song the bars do not exist so far as the african is concerned the song consists of groups of claps the rest of the song is one phrase of four claps the total is claps the african musical phrase does not exist the african phrases are built up of the numbers or their multiples of a combination of and or the multiples of this combination thus this phrase of is thus repeated the division being the song is in call and response form though on repeats the chorus sings the whole of it most african singing is built on this cantor and chorus basis though there are a number of different ways in which the principle may be developed to illustrate the rhythmic fusion of dancing singing and clappinga song for little boys and girls ahiavia yeye tsoe da de abatia dzi nam loo ahiavia gbogbo tsoe da de abatia dzi nam loo my small lover you are welcome put it on the bed for me it refers to the headkerchief the boy has brought as a present all form a circle one child acts as cantor and starts singing at the word yeye they all clap after the song has started any one dancer moves into the circle dances for about three repeats and dances out to herhis former place music the one feature that should be noticed is at the word yeye the syncopation here occurs three timesonly at the beginning and no where else there are two claps to this song which are performed simultaneously some children doing one and some the other without prearrangement the first is a regular succession of claps of crochet value of the same intensity if the second clap is performed by itself and without the song it appears to be of a certain regular pattern but it is not quite this in order to get the rhythm of the second clap the performer adds silently in his head some extra claps during the rests in his pattern and mentally plays the following pattern in combination with clap one thus the rhythm established is two claps and a pauserepeat there are crochets to the whole song ie rose brandel in her transcripts makes the important contribution of the realization that the pitch of the drums and of their individual drumbeats is important she actually gives the pitch of one drum b b below middle c for other drums she gives the relative pitches of the drumnotes forming the musical patterns of each drum but she does not correlate the pitches of the several drums with one another she is aware of the polyrhythms of the drum music but does not realize the fundamental principles involved the scoring of the drums presents another problem with melodic instruments used in the west the scores indicates the pitch of the notes required there is no need to show how they are produced but with the african drums the situation is different in the first place the drum does not give out a clearly defined note which the ear can easily recognize as being of definite pitch moreover there is a difference in pitch of one drum note to another a difference that extends over more than an octave african drumbeats vary not only in pitch but also in quality therefore it is important in the case of drumming to know which hand a performer uses for any given note and how he played the note the score should ideally show not only the rhythm and the pitch of the notes but also how each note was made to place the drum notes on a musical stave facts have to be considered which hand played it what position on the drumskin it was played whether or not the other hand was also employed simultaneously in producing it and if so in what way the drums the core of the african instrumentation are often grouped in sets or families of three they are of various sizes as high as three feet and are made of hollow logs covered at one end by sheep hide this instrument of african parentage so popular today was and still is used in many remote areas of africa used for a variety of purposes for calling and signalling announcing death social dances harvest rites wakes and funerals the beats of all the other instruments shows a very high state of development it is especially complex and subtle in its rhythmic organization the very essence of african music is to cross the rhythms this does not mean syncopation by crossing the rhythm we mean if two africans are drumming in triple time and at the same speed the main beat of the bars of no drum will fall either on the second beat or on the third beat of number one drum but never on the first this is absolutely fundamental to african music the same is true of indian music and indian tabla small drums we find here the same movement from complication of rhythm and meter to greater unity and coincidence that was found in indian and other oriental music orchestraafrican stylewith particular reference to rwe a west african tribe the orchestra consists of three sections the background rhythm section the drum section and claps and song the instruments include the drums the double bell gonkogui two high pitched gongs called atoke each with its playing rod made of iron similar instruments are used by different tribes and are called by different names but they play the same role as mentioned here the background rhythmic sectionthe gonkogui is the foundation of the section it is a double clapperless belltwo bells welded at the top to form a tine by which it is held when played with a stick it gives two clear notes in which the upper partials are inaudible this provides the background rhythm which keeps the whole orchestra in time what gonkogui plays is a rhythm pattern and not a succession of regular beats the one responsible for the actual tempo is the master drummer the gonkogui is accompanied by axatse a rattle the rattle pattern is derived from those of gonggong but is not identical again different tribes have different playing techniques the rattle shake gives an intense clattering sound of high pitch the downward stroke produces a low slightly muffled sound the upward stroke sounds crisp and high atoke is another gonglike instrument which is used as background rhythm small and boatshaped it is couched in the hand without the fingers touching the ends the desired sound is a very high rather thin and slightly metallic singing tone the drums are the most important section of the orchestra forming its main body about four drums are used normally i have already explained the rhythm and the score involved however what the exact factors are which determine the tuning is a difficult matter to find what exactly is the african listening to it is not a case of absolute pitch it must be so tuned that the notes rise and fall very clearly the third section of the orchestra is the song and its attendant handclapping the handclap is the rhythmic link between the song and the other instruments so true of other tribal music the clap phrase and the phrases of the instrument supplying background music eg gonkogui are always in the same phrase one with the other the songs are in free rhythm though this is illusory when the song is sung and repeated its syllables and claps fall in exactly the same equivalent places in the gonkogui pattern in this instance finally in most african music tension operates within the phrase and is the organizing articulating principle of the phrase but tension does not perform an overall organizing function except in the sense that it creates a type of variations form these instruments though lacking the precision of western technology still recognizably belong to the familiar families of wind string and percussiononly they produce a dilferent rhythm and a different melody so appealing and pleasant to the ear considering afroamerican folk music it is difficult to explore it or understand it properly without recognizing its african heritage this does not mean that afroamerican music is african but that many characteristics of african musical styles persist to this day two of these characteristics are melodic and rhythmic concepts which are most noticeable and easily recognized in order to captivate the essence of african music it is necessary not only to hear it but to see it with ones own eyes the drummer beating the drums the dancers dancing in complete harmony with the drumbeatings and the singers singing in complete harmony with the clapping no matter how strange it may sound in the beginning if hearing for the first time one is soon absorbed in tapping the floor with the foot or clapping the hands mentally if not audibly aime cesaire by ellen conroy kennedy e had arrived in the w middle of the first world festival of negro arts a three week international spectacle held in the senegalese capital in april bringing together from africa europe the caribbean north and south america black artists writers performers scholars in expositions of every art form from ancient to contemporary in handicraft sculpture painting dance theater music films literaturethe whole prefaced by a weeklong colloquium on the function and meaning of negro art in the life of the people see negro digestjune july august september the exhilaration was contagious my own was dampened only by the fatigue of a transatlantic flight and the knowledge we had missed by just a few hours the nuit de la poesie a gala evening of dramatic readings by the senegalese actor bachir toure followed by the solemn awarding of festival prizes in the numerous categories of competition a poetry reading the key event of a festival of negro arts yes but for the selfaffirmative poetry through which years earlier a small group of african and west indian students in paris found their authentic voice rediscovered what they called their negritude the festival would never have taken place it was through this extraordinary body of writings the poems of aime cesaire leopold senghor birago and david diop bernard dadie jacques rabemananjara and othersthat negritude first found expression it has matured since then from a simple protest against cultural assimilation into a cultural philosophy now articulated by leopold senghor president of senegal as a new humanism in which the negros special contribution to world culture will at last have a fully recognized share so the marriage of a gala poetry reading and the awarding of festival prizes was particularly fitting i scanned the pages of dakar matin for a report of the evening and the literary prizes the elder poets aime cesaire and leopold senghor for example were not in the running of course from their group had come the juries to single out for honors writers of a younger generation cesaire who invented negritude philosophical premise of the festival and leader of the literary school grown up around it had headed the french language literary jury i read while the american poet langston hughes was chairman of the english language section it was these elders whose work is still so little translated and so little known in the united states who drew my interest most theirs were the works knew and would teach i would have a chance to meet many of them i was soon told at a special postcolloquium session where the madagascan poetstatesman jacques rabemananjara would speak two evenings later that evening aime cesaire leon damas alioune diop bernard dadie birago diop most of the festivals french language literary notables though not that visitorfromanotherplanet evgeny yevtuschenko were circulating among the crowd gathered in the lobby of the assemblee nationale w the effect was rather like seeing mallarme rimbaud verlaine corbiere and laforgue all in one room only negritudes baudelaire president senghor seemed to be missing yet his presence was felt in every way but the physical since the festival was surely his creation more than any other single persons langston hughes was on hand too autographing books in green ink with wide round palmer method letters for mr hughes was one of the surviving grand old men of the s harlem renaissance his poems and stories together with those of gaude mackay countee cullen and jean toomer had had a profound impact on the originators of negritude negro students from french colonies in africa and the caribbean who read them in paris a decade later like hughes cesaire was seated at a card table chatting with clusters of admirers writing gracious dedications in copies of the various works they presented him his poetry les armes miraculeuses ferrements cadastre his plays one of which la tragedie du roi christophe later marked a high point of the festival with senghor and haile selassie in gala attendance his essays the discours sur le colonialisme the lettre a maurice thorez his resignation from the french communist party and his study of the haitian revolutionary toussaint vouverture i recognized him instantly with something of a start yet how could one have expected to find the same young militant whose dark face incendiary eyes and radiant white smile glow forth from a photograph today in his fifties the poets eyes are softened with spectacles his face a trifle lined and heavier his fervor perhaps not dampened but seasoned by more than years as poet parliamentarian for the former lycee professor is also the longtime mayor of his home town fortaufrance and deputy from his island martinique to the chambre des deputes in paris turning his attention toward us cesaire flashed the invincible magnetic smile edouard maunick the young mauritian poet we had met the day before murmured an introduction i passed monsieur cesaire several volumes to autograph mentioning my regret at not having found a copy of his first and still bestknown work cahier dun retour au pays natal this is the poem the late andre breton dean of french surrealists called nothing less than the greatest lyric monument of our time in which he discovered that major tone which distinguishes great from lesser poets publication of les armes miraculeuses just after world war ii and of the first complete edition of the cahier soon afterwards established cesaire in the front rank of french poets he was hailed as the great renewer of surrealism though his originality was far more than simply stylistic the ethnic element his magnificent messianic identification with all peoples of african heritage these thematic qualities were still more distinctive the poets close friend senghor has spoken of the cahiers parturition in pain the pain of its genesis in the year old poets anguished confrontation with the misery of his island his people his race a dramatic monologue of some pages his notes on a return to the native land begins as a bitterly ironic inventory of rage despair and frustration to become an exorcism and then an acceptance an immense surging affirmation of the poets negroness of all negroness and a personal dedication to its cause you know it is not from hate for other races that i seek to be the plowman of this single race what i wish for the universal hunger for the universal thirst is to shake it free at last to summon from its inner depths the succulence of fruit if leon damas startling poems pigments were the first rejection of cultural assimilation cesaires cahier written in was the first direct lyric proclamation of negritude his words as jeanpaul sartre has put it do not describe negritude they do not designate it they do not copy it from outside as a painter does a model they make it they compose it under our eyes one of the great poems of our century the cahier dun retour au pays natal is the literary movements inspirational emblem the one incomparable work to which all african and west indian poets in french refer in whose stature they are measured alas the cahier was temporarily out of print cesaire said and when would there be a new american edition i knew there had been a bilingual version of only copies with translations by ivan goll and lionel abel published in by brentanos in new york surely it was time it were available again a cuban refugee we knew owned wifredo lams original drawings for another edition the frenchspanish one published in havana in couldnt an american publisher put them together for a new frenchenglish edition why not smiled cesaire and as for the drawings if the old ones were not enough perhaps wifredo would make new ones had he lams address yes in a notebook at his brothers villa where he was staying during the festival the poet jotted down a phone number on a tiny leaf of graphed notepaper asking us to call a few days later since he was leaving the city that evening cesaire and one or two other close friends maunick later told us would be spending those few days in casamance the lush southern part of senegal as guests of president senghor but now others were waiting to speak to the poet we said goodbye and moved on the interview itself came about unexpectedly i phoned on the appointed afternoon cesaire had just lunched he would be tied up the following day our last in dakar but now he had an hour to spare before the dress rehearsal of la tragedie du roi christophe cesaires play about the rise and fall of henrichristophe despot ruler of independent th century haiti was a highpoint of the festival its pertinence to the careers of certain contemporary african statesmen was not lost on the dakar audience would my husband and i care to come over right away we were delighted and asked if we could bring along a journalist friend who was also anxious to meet him the taxi left us in front of a large townhouse just visible through the iron gate in a sixfoot high wall we rang and cesaire himself came down to meet us ushering us through a small garden up a flight of stairs to the parlor floor we stepped through a corridor into a spacious highceilinged room its coolness refreshing after the almost blinding sunshine outside a tall shuttered window on the far side was open letting in the sea breeze that brings relief in dakar even from the intense midday heat leaning out one caught a green glimpse framed in the deep blue of sky and water of the ancient fortress island goree here for more than years captives from the african interior were held prisoner in slavedepots before their deportation west to the americas a museum now the prison can be reached by motor launch from the harbor of dakar in minutes during the festival it was the scene of a nightly soundandlight spectacular we shook hands and i introduced the journalist friend who had accompanied us did monsieur cesaire understand english more or less he indicated though he preferred not to try to speak it we decided to put our questions in french and i would interpret if needed occasionally as we talked he would repeat a question in french to check that he had understood it properly as he spoke i noticed he had the trace of a lisp it interfered not at all with the warmth the thoughtfulness and precision with which he talked sometimes moving forward in his chair occasionally breaking into smiles pausing or altering his inflection to emphasize a point where white and black meet by frantz fanon ie negro to whites is a phobogenic object a stimulus to anxiety from the patient treated by serieux and capgras to the girl who confides to me that to go to bed with a negro would be terrifying to her one discovers all the stages of what i shall call the negrophobogenesis there has been much talk of psychoanalysis in connection with the negro distrusting the ways in which it might be applied i have preferred to call this chapter the negro and psychopathology well aware that freud and adler and even the cosmic jung did not think of the negro in all their investigations and they were quite right not to have it is too often forgotten that neurosis is not a basic element of human reality like it or not the oedipus complex is far from coming into being among negroes it might be argued as malinowski contends that the matriarchal structure is the only reason for its absence but putting aside the question whether the ethnologists are not so imbued with the complexes of their own civilization that they are compelled to try to find them duplicated in the peoples they study it would be relatively easy for me to show that in the french antilles per cent of the families cannot produce one oedipal neurosis this incapacity is one on which we heartily congratulate ourselves with the exception of a few misfits within the closed environment we can say that every neurosis every abnormal manifestation every affective erethism in an antillean is the product of his cultural situation in other words there is a constellation of postulates a series of propositions that slowly and subtlywith the help of books newspapers schools and their texts advertisements films radiowork their way into ones mind and shape ones view of the world of the group to which one belongs in the antilles that view of the world is white because no black voice exists the folklore of martinique is meager and few children in fortdefrance know the stories of compe lapin twin brother of the brer rabbit of louisianas uncle remus a european familiar with the current trends of negro poetry for example would be amazed to learn that as late as no antillean found it possible to think of himself as a negro it was only with the appearance of aime cesaire that the acceptance of negritude and the statement of its claims began to be perceptible the most concrete proof of this furthermore is that feeling which pervades each new generation of students arriving in paris it takes them several weeks to recognize that contact with europe compels them to face a certain number of problems that until their arrival had never touched them and yet these problems were by no means invisible i whenever i had a discussion with my professors or talked with european patients i became aware of the differences that might prevail between the two worlds talking recently to a physician who had always practiced in fortdefrance i told him what conclusions i had arrived at he went farther saying that they were valid not only in psychopathology but also in general medicine in the same way he added you never encounter a case of pure typhoid such as you studied in the textbooks there is always a more or less manifest complication of malaria it would be interesting to study for example a case of schizophrenia as experienced by a negroif indeed that kind of malady were to be found there what am i getting at quite simply this when the negro makes contact with the white world a certain sensitizing action takes place if his psychic structure is weak one observes a collapse of the ego the black man stops behaving as an actional person the goal of his behavior will be the other in the guise of the white man for the other alone can give him worth that is on the ethical level selfesteem but there is something else i have said that the negro is phobogenic what is phobia i prefer to answer that question by relying on the latest work of hesnard phobia is a neurosis characterized by the anxious fear of an object in the broadest sense of anything outside the individual or by extension of a situation naturally that object must have certain aspects it must arouse hesnard says both fear and revulsion but here we encounter a difficulty applying the genetic method to the understanding of phobia charles odier wrote that all anxiety derives from a certain subjective insecurity linked to the absence of the mother this occurs according to odier sometime in the second year of life investigating the psychic structure of the phobic he comes to this conclusion before attacking the adult beliefs all the elements of the infantile structure which produced them must be analyzed the choice of the phobic object is therefore overdetermined this object does not come at random out of the void of nothingness in some situation it has previously evoked an affect in the patient his phobia is the latent presence of this affect at the root of his world there is an organization that has been given a form for the object naturally need not be there it is enough that somewhere it exist it is a possibility this object is endowed with evil intentions and with all the attributes of a malefic power in the phobic affect has a priority that defies all rational thinking as we can see the phobic is a person who is governed by the laws of rational prelogic and affective prelogic methods of thinking and feeling that go back to the age at which he experienced the event that impaired his security the difficulty indicated here is this was there a trauma harmful to security in the case of the young woman whom we mentioned a little earlier in the majority of negrophobic men has there been an attempt at rape an attempt at fellatio proceeding with complete orthodoxy we should be led by the application of analytic conclusions to this if an extremely frightening object such as a more or less imaginary attacker arouses terror this is alsofor most often such cases are those of womenand especially a terror mixed with sexual revulsion im afraid of men really means at the bottom of the motivation of the fear because they might do all kinds of things to me but not commonplace cruelties sexual abusesin other words immoral and shameful things contact alone is enough to evoke anxiety for contact is at the same time the basic schematic type of initiating sexual action touching caressessexuality since we have learned to know all the tricks the ego uses in order to defend itself we know too that its denials must in no case be taken literally are we not now observing a complete inversion basically does this fear of rape not itself cry out for rape just as there are faces that ask to be slapped can one not speak of women who ask to be raped in if he hollers let him go chester himes describes this type very well the big blonde trembles whenever the negro goes near her yet she has nothing to fear since the factory is full of white men in the end she and the negro go to bed together when i was in military service i had the opportunity to observe the behavior of white women from three or four european countries when they were among negroes at dances most of the time the women made involuntary gestures of flight of withdrawing their faces filled with a fear that was not feigned and yet the negroes who asked them to dance would have been utterly unable to commit any act at all against them even if they had wished to do so the behavior of these women is clearly understandable from the standpoint of imagination that is because the negrophobic woman is in fact nothing but a putative sexual partner just as the negrophobic man is a repressed homosexual in relation to the negro everything takes place on the genital level a few years ago i remarked to some friends during a discussion that in a general sense the white man behaves toward the negro as an elder brother reacts to the birth of a younger i have since learned that richard sterba arrived at the same conclusion in america on the phenomenological level there would be a double reality to be observed the jew is feared because of his potential for acquisitiveness they are everywhere the banks the stock exchanges the government are infested with them they control everything soon the whole country will belong to them they do better in examinations than the real frenchmen soon they will be making the laws for us not long ago an acquaintance studying for the civil service said to me say what you want they take good care of one another when moch was in power for instance the number of kikes in government jobs was appalling in the medical profession the situation is no different every jewish student who wins a prize in a competition does it through pull as for the negroes they have tremendous sexual powers what do you expect with all the freedom they have in their jungles they copulate at all times and in all places they are really genital they have so many children that they cannot even count them be careful or they will flood us with little mulattoes things are indeed going to hell the government and the civil service are at the mercy of the jews our women are at the mercy of the negroes for the sexual potency of the negro is hallucinating that is indeed the word this potency must be hallucinating psychoanalysts who study the problem soon enough find the mechanisms of every neurosis sexual anxiety is predominant here all the negrophobic women i have known had abnormal sex lives their husbands had left them or they were widows and they were afraid to find a substitute for the dead husband or they were divorced and they had doubts at the thought of a new object investment all of them endowed the negro with powers that other men husbands transient lovers did not have and besides there was also an element of perversion the persistence of infantile formations god knows how they make love it must be terrifying there is one expression that through time has become singularly eroticized the black athlete there is something in the mere idea one young woman confided to me that makes the heart skip a beat a prostitute told me that in her early days the mere thought of going to bed with a negro brought on an orgasm she went in search of negroes and never asked them for money but she added going to bed with them was no more remarkable than going to bed with white men it was before i did it that i had the orgasm i used to think about imagine all the things they might do to me and that was what was so terrific still on the genital level when a white man hates black men is he not yielding to a feeling of impotence or of sexual inferiority since his ideal is an infinite virility is there not a phenomenon of diminution in relation to the negro who is viewed as a penis symbol is the lynching of the negro not a sexual revenge we know how much of sexuality there is in all cruelties tortures beatings one has only to reread a few pages of the marquis de sade to be easily convinced of the fact is the negros superiority real everyone knows that it is not but that is not what matters the prelogical thought of the phobic has decided that such is the case another woman developed a negrophobia after she had read jirai cracher sur vos tombes i tried to demonstrate the irrationality of her position by pointing out to her that victimized white women were as sick as the negro besides i added this was no case of black vengeance as the title of the book might seem to imply because the author was a white man boris vian i had to accept the futility of all such efforts that young woman did not want to listen anyone who has read the book will understand at once the ambivalence her phobia revealed i knew a negro medical student who would not dare to make a vaginal examination of any patient in the gynecological clinic he told me that one day he had heard one of them say theres a nigger in there if he touches me ill slap his face you never know with them he must have great big hands and besides hes sure to be rough if one wants to understand the racial situation psychoanalytically not from a universal viewpoint but as it is experienced by individual consciousnesses considerable importance must be given to sexual phenomena in the case of the jew one thinks of money and its cognates in that of the negro one thinks of sex antisemitism can be rationalized on a basic level it is because he takes over the country that the jew is a danger an acquaintance told me recently that although he was not an antisemite he had been constrained to admit that the majority of jews whom he had known during the war had behaved very badly i tried in vain to get him to concede that such a statement was the fruit of a determined desire to find the essence of the jew wherever it might exist on a clinical level i am reminded of the story of the young woman who suffered from a kind of tactile delirium constantly washing her hands and arms ever since the day a jew had been introduced to her jeanpaul sartre has made a masterful study of the problem of antisemitism let us try to determine what are the constituents of negrophobia this phobia is to be found on an instinctual biological level at the extreme i should say that the negro because of his body impedes the closing of the postural schema of the white manat the point naturally at which the black man makes his entry into the phenomenal world of the white man this is not the place in which to state the conclusions i drew from studying the influence exerted on the body by the appearance of another body let us assume for example that four fifteenyearold boys all more or less athletic are doing the high jump one of them wins by jumping four feet ten inches then a fifth boy arrives and tops the mark by a halfinch the four other bodies experience a destructuration what is important to us here is to show that with the negro the cycle of the biological begins the penis the symbol of manhood is annihilated which is to say that it is denied the difference between the two attitudes is apparent the jew is attacked in his religious identity in his history in his race in his relations with his ancestors and with his posterity when one sterilizes a jew one cuts off the source every time that a jew is persecuted it is the whole race that is persecuted in his person but it is in his corporeality that the negro is attacked it is as a concrete personality that he is lynched it is as an actual being that he is a threat the jewish menace is replaced by the fear of the sexual potency of the negro o mannoni said an argument widely used by racialists against those who do not share their convictions is worthy of mention for its revealing character what they say if you had a daughter do you mean to say that you would marry her to a negro i have seen people who appeared to have no racialist bias lose all critical sense when confronted with this kind of question the reason is that such an argument disturbs certain uneasy feelings in them more exactly incestuous feelings and they turn to racialism as a defence reaction before we go further it seems important to make this point granted that unconscious tendencies toward incest exist why should these tendencies emerge more particularly with respect to the negro in what way taken as an absolute does a black soninlaw differ from a white soninlaw is there not a reaction of unconscious tendencies in both cases why not for instance conclude that the father revolts because in his opinion the negro will introduce his daughter into a sexual universe for which the father does not have the key the weapons or the attributes every intellectual gain requires a loss in sexual potential the civilized white man retains an irrational longing for unusual eras of sexual license of orgiastic scenes of unpunished rapes of unrepressed incest in one way these fantasies respond to freuds life instinct projecting his own desires onto the negro the white man behaves as if the negro really had them when it is a question of the jew the problem is clear he is suspect because he wants to own the wealth or take over the positions of power but the negro is fixated at the genital or at any rate he has been fixated there two realms the intellectual and the sexual an erection on rodins thinker is a shocking thought one cannot decently have a hard on everywhere the negro symbolizes the biological danger the jew the intellectual danger to suffer from a phobia of negroes is to be afraid of the biological for the negro is only biological the negroes are animals they go about naked and god alone knows mannoni said further in his urge to identify the anthropoid apes caliban the negroes even the jews with the mythological figures of the satyrs man reveals that there are sensitive spots in the human soul at a level where thought becomes confused and where sexual excitement is strangely linked with violence and aggressiveness mannoni includes the jew in his scale i see nothing inappropriate there but here the negro is the master he is the specialist of this matter whoever says rape says negro over three or four years i questioned some members of the white racefrench german english italian i took advantage of a certain air of trust of relaxation in each instance i waited until my subject no longer hesitated to talk to me quite openlythat is until he was sure that he would not offend me or else in the midst of associational tests i inserted the word negro among some twenty others almost per cent of the replies took this form negro brought forth biology penis strong athletic potent boxer joe louis jesse owens senegalese troops savage animal devil sin senegalese soldier used as the stimulus evoked dreadful bloody tough strong it is interesting to note that one in fifty reacted to the word negro with nazi or when one knows the emotional meaning of the ss image one recognizes that the difference from the other answers is negligible let me add that some europeans helped me by giving the test to their acquaintances in such cases the proportion went up notably from this result one must acknowledge the effect of my being a negro unconsciously there was a certain reticence the negro symbolizes the biological first of all he enters puberty at the age of nine and is a father at the age of ten he is hotblooded and his blood is strong he is tough as a white man remarked to me not long ago with a certain bitterness you all have strong constitutions what a beautiful racelook at the senegalese werent they called our black devils during the war but they must be brutal i just cant see them putting those big hands of theirs on my shoulders i shudder at the mere thought of it well aware that in certain cases one must interpret by opposites i understand this extrafragile woman at bottom what she wants most is to have the powerful negro bruise her frail shoulders sartre says that when one speaks the phrase a young jewess there is an imaginary reek of rape and pillage conversely we might say that the expression a handsome negro contains a possible allusion to similar phenomena i have always been struck by the speed with which handsome young negro turns into young colt or stallion in the film mourning becomes electra a good part of the plot is based on sexual rivalry orin rebukes his sister vinnie because she admired the splendid naked natives of the south seas he cannot forgive her for it analysis of the real is always difficult an investigator can choose between two attitudes toward his subject first he can be satisfied only to describe in the manner of those anatomists who are all surprised when in the midst of a description of the tibia they are asked how many fibular depressions they have that is because in their researches there is never a question of themselves but of others in the beginning of my medical studies after several nauseating sessions in the dissection room i asked an older hand how i could prevent such reactions my friend pretend youre dissecting a cat and everything will be all right second once he has described reality the investigator can make up his mind to change it in principle however the decision to describe seems naturally to imply a critical approach and therefore a need to go farther toward some solution both authorized and anecdotal literature have created too many stories about negroes to be suppressed but putting them all together does not help us in our real task which is to disclose their mechanics what matters for us is not to collect facts and behavior but to find their meaning here we can refer to jaspers when he wrote comprehension in depth of a single instance will often enable us phenomenologically to apply this understanding in general to innumerable cases often what one has once grasped is soon met again what is important in phenomenology is less the study of a large number of instances than the intuitive and deep understanding of a few individual cases the question that arises is this can the white man behave healthily toward the black man and can the black man behave healthily toward the white man a pseudoquestion some will say but when we assert that european culture has an imago of the negro which is responsible for all the conflicts that may arise we do not go beyond reality in the chapter on language we saw that on the screen the negro faithfully reproduces that imago even serious writers have made themselves its spokesmen so it was that michel cournot could write the black mans sword is a sword when he has thrust it into your wife she has really felt something it is a revelation in the chasm that it has left your little toy is lost pump away until the room is awash with your sweat you might as well just be singing this is goodby four negroes with their penises exposed would fill a cathedral they would be unable to leave the building until their erections had subsided and in such close quarters that would not be a simple matter to be comfortable without problems they always have the open air but then they are faced with a constant insult the palm tree the breadfruit tree and so many other proud growths that would not slacken for an empire erect as they are for all eternity and piercing heights that are not easily reached at any price when one reads this passage a dozen times and lets oneself gothat is when one abandons oneself to the movement of its imagesone is no longer aware of the negro but only of a penis the negro is eclipsed he is turned into a penis he is a penis it is easy to imagine what such descriptions can stimulate in a young girl in lyon horror lust not indifference in any case now what is the truth the average length of the penis among the black men of africa dr pales says rarely exceed millimeters inches testut in his traite danatomie hwnaine offers the same figure for the european but these are facts that persuade no one the white man is convinced that the negro is a beast if it is not the length of the penis then it is the sexual potency that impresses him face to face with this man who is different from himself he needs to defend himself in other words to personify the other the other will become the mainstay of his preoccupations and his desires the prostitute whom i mentioned earlier told me that her hunt for negroes dated from the time when she had been told this story one night a woman who was in bed with a negro went mad she remained insane for two years but then when she had been cured refused to go to bed with anyone else the prostitute did not know what had driven the other woman mad but she sought furiously to reproduce the same situation to discover this secret which was part of the ineffable one must recognize that what she wanted was the destruction the dissolution of her being on a sexual level every experiment that she made with a negro reinforced her limitations this delirium of orgasm was unattainable she could not experience it so she avenged herself by losing herself in speculation one thing must be mentioned in this connection a white woman who has had a negro lover finds it difficult to return to white men or so at least it is believed particularly by white men who knows what they can give a woman who indeed does know certainly they do not on this subject i cannot overlook this comment by etiemble racial jealousy produces the crimes of racism to many white men the black is simply that marvelous sword which once it has transfixed their wives leaves them forever transfigured my statistical sources have been able to provide me with no documentation on this point i have however known some negroes some white women who have had negroes and finally some negro women who have had white lovers i have heard enough confidences from all of them to be able to deplore the fact that m cournot applies his talents to the rejuvenation of a fable in which the white man will always be able to find a specious argument shameful dubious and thus doubly effective crisis of consciousness by richard a long american artist of african descent has j ii r had certain options l he could insulate himself as anist and a person usually by expatriation he could keep his art pure while reacting personally to his condition he could respond to that condition by and with his artistic expressivity these choices have roughly characterized three periods of expression in the plastic arts by afroamericans while no means alone henry ossawa tanner illustrates the first option a pupil of thomas eakins he reflects some of the lessons of that master in the banjo lesson now at hampton institute this painting is clearly a masterpiece of the american genre school but in seeking his artistic identity tanner found it necessary to go to france as had eakins before him and unlike eakins to remain there a portion of tanners considerable achievement has been recognized in a recent exhibition at new yorks grand central galleries the second option is demonstrated by laura wheeler waring she like tanner and the sculptress meta warrick fuller was a graduate of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts she followed a career in teaching all the while painting portraits and stilllife with quiet elegance and style the third option that of using art as the means of expressing a distinct ethnic identity in the context of american society did not appear yesterday during the twenties the period of the harlem renaissance it was the explicit program of young writers such as langston hughes it received the encouragement of alain locke and james weldon johnson who were the revered spokesmen of an older generation the work of aaron douglas at that time was hailed as reflecting this spirit in painting and it was he who was selected to illustrate dr lockes the new negro and other ethnic books of the period dr locke remained ever on the search for an artist who would embody his ideal of an ethnic afroamerican expression nevertheless the harlem renaissance did not produce artists who could be fully compared with its writers in this respect the problems of the artist are different and he reacts differently formal considerations arise which place questions of subject and content aside sometimes for a long period some times indefinitely two examples may be mentioned the first is w h johnson born in in south carolina he studied at the national academy of design in new york in the early twenties in he went to france remaining there until nineteenthirty found him once more in europe this time in denmark where he married a danish artist only in was he once more in the u s where world war ii forced him to remain until his works after student days reflect a cezannesque french period an expressionistic scandinavian period and an astounding primitive american period the result of the artistic rediscovery of his ethnic origins in the highly sophisticated vision of his exile was rudely displaced by a basic upheaval even more imperative than it at first seemed for a mental collapse followed the first large scale exhibition of johnsons work was held at the college museum hampton institute in the spring of drawing on hamptons holdings and those of the national collection of fine arts both gifts of the harmon foundation beauford delaney a painter of the same generation as johnson went from rural kentucky to boston where his studies at the school of fine arts began with drawings from the antique he came to new york at the end of the twenties as the harlem renaissance was drawing to a close his personal vision led him from an early academicism to a hearty expressionism culminating in a long series of green street paintings in the forties beauford delaney went to paris in the fifties where his evolution has been toward an abstract impressionism of great subtlety ever an ethnically conscious person delaneys long absence from the united states has been in no sense an exile his rumination in the past and his active contemplation of the present encompass the broad spectrum of black experience in america his new york period has been apotheosized by henry miller in remember to remember and the paris period by james baldwin in a glowing tribute printed as introduction to delaneys galerie lambert show an ensemble of his work has been on permanent exhibition at morgan state college in baltimore since the artistic program of the harlem renaissance was partially realized by a number of artists who first appeared during the wpa period such as charles alston jacob lawrence and charles sebree associated with the mood and spirit of the wpa are the mexicaninspired murals of hale woodruff at talladega and at atlanta university and of charles white at hampton institute there was a tendency during the wpa period to see the afroamerican experience from either a populist or marxist viewpoint and therefore as part of a universal one the artists tended to regard the content of their work as reflecting in a particular way a universal problem concomitant with this then was a general feeling that no identification of an artist as negro or afroamerican was desirable or necessary this may be said to have been the position of most afroamerican artists in the period from the end of the depression to less than four years ago what then has happened why do we now hear of afroamerican artists what is the significance of an exhibition which can draw people to the great hall of city university in new york as did the evolution of afroamerican artists last october no simple answer is possible it must be remembered though that there was a similar exhibition assembled by alonzo aden in chicago in hence what we are witnessing may be cyclical on the other hand there are two influences one international and one domestic to which the artist necessarily responds the domestic one which has been summed up in the slogans white backlash and black_power the first certainly preceded the second hence why not white power and black backlash is an increasing source of personal frustration to all americans of african descent the second is negritude a philosophy of african values and insights proposed as a substitute foror complement toeuroamerican materialist values a philosophy which not unsurprisingly finds its immediate source in the harlem renaissance the crisis of consciousness which the afroamerican artist is undergoing today is similar to that of the entire community to which he belongs a community which is in large part of somebody elses making the observed ferment may be an attempt on the part of that community to remake itself in a manner that is emotionally satisfying the role of the artist in this enterprise could be a great one beg your pardon my dear sirbut you canf t possibly be an african on the contrary the gentleman pictured here is a tribal chieftain from the province of timbo in guinea one of the frenchspeaking countries of west africa and the ancestral home of many thousands of american negroes he is a slender proud amberhued young man who divested of his traditional boubou and dressed in western attire would be indistinguishable from any other goodlooking intelligent young man seen say on the streets of detroit or atlanta to a nation of people accustomed to thinking of africans in the images fostered for so long by the communications media the guinean might come as a shock but he is very real and very african what then is an african an african is a person from africa just as an american is a person from america and there are at least as many variations in the colors and facial characteristics of africans as there are among americans an african might be a blueeyed blond from the kabyles of algeria or an ebonyblack wolof from senegal what the people of these extremely divergent groups have in common as do hundreds of groups ranging between their two poles is a heritage on the african continent which goes back many hundreds of years throughout the centuries there have been blending among these various peoples just as there have been among the different groups in europe or asia or the americas and just as there always will be where human beings come together american movies cartoons news features and often television shows have tended to picture africans as primitive sometimes savage people without traditions or culture thus contributing criminally to the worlds ignorance but now it is possible to know africans as they truly are the knowledge will enrich you
brother malcolm and the black revolution by william keorapetse kgositsile write this with something bordering on fear among many other things malcolm like nationalism is too many different things to too many people perhaps there would be nothing especially unfortunate and regrettable about that but because of the different levels of our consciousness shaped by the varying degrees of filth and cowardice in us our general understanding of malcolm is therefore necessarily a distortion also running through my mind are the following words of setswana wisdom a motswana doctor throws his bones and when they tell him of an irretrievable loss he will say se ileng se ile se ile mosimeng motlhaelathupa lesilo ke moselatedi loosely translated this says what is gone is goneit has qone down the hole theunreachablebyarodthe irrational ie the unwise and illtempered is hewhofollowsit but then again i realize that malik our monumental spiritual thrust is not gone down any hole if we had been stronger and more intelligent in malcolm the brother we thought we knew and admired would still have been with us today and today blackman where is rap brown max stanford mandela sobukweamong many other free black men and women you see until we actually stop these racist maniacs who are opposed to any world order that challenges their decadence and racist perversions they will continue to kill our leaders and any voices which by articulating what is or should be in every black heart become a direct threat to the warped white sensibility and its hideous creations but to stop the madness of these perverts we have to move to positions of power before we can move to positions of power we have to know ourselves so that we can among many other necessary things identify the enemy with a very precise clarity this necessarily involves formulating a revolutionary ideology which will facilitate the building of our selfreliant communities and our veritable social institutions which is where malcolm was at which is why malcolm was murdered but let us look beneath the sore to talk of a revolutionary ideology is to talk about the spirit of a people and malcolm as i have said was our spiritual thrust many people who have written about malcolm have overlooked deliberatelv or unwittingly the importance of his inner landscape his spirit but leroi jones not surprisingly he has been talking about the supremacy of the spirit for the past few years could not overlook such an important aspect of malcotms energy malik was the surse at one point and his relationship to the nation of islam is as graphic a picture of world spirit as exists and his break into a secular political intelligence understanding his murder rendered most of the things directly associated with him into ruin his finally was an abstract energy a symbolizing of certain times of certain spirit he was murdered because he summed up the whole blackwhite struggle in america and the world too easily he has risen in a wide arccircle to embrace a whole public consciousness he was pimpprisoner studentmonk firebrandwiseman and martyr in each place his spirit settled something was turned on and over a beginning an ending jones is talking about what did not die what cannot die which is what we must understand blood to blood we are talking about things deeper than the eye malcolm the mover and the moved the authentic lover fire and love malik the pledge of fire of song the most powerful forces on malcolms inner landscape informed his movement the practical manifestations of his abstract energy which jones talked about fire and love those two forces in the inner landscape are a spiritual measure a way of enabling us to know that we can if we are willing and determined but for us to know if we can actually we must see the promise the hope in us or around us that what we are striving for is w actually possible and know that after that point there can be no turning back malcolm knew he could that we can malcolm was willing and determined malcolm underwent the internal revolution and internalized the black revolution the world revolution brother malcolm was our dream our promise our hope a concrete vector of our desire and possibility the actual embodiment of what wc strive to beintrepid righteous dedicated to the destruction of evil dedicated to the rebuilding of man and our possi bilities as only the sincere lover can be constantly moving to know you love to know you are loved this is supreme this was and will always be the godly power in malcolm his energy spiritual malcolm was our sun our son when we know we love words of love become acts of love recreating the powerful gods in us making us our moment the supreme rhythmthat is the pulse of the most desirable forces in our sensibility which is spiritual we belong to our time we belong to each other through our journey to and in the breath we seek a spiritual cleanliness informing our vision to keep on pushing relentlessly to reshape the world in the image of this vision fire and love greater than our weaknesses or shortcomings past reason or reasonableness create a force relentlessly demanding a complete union with the soul an abstract energy a symbolizing of certain times of certain spirit gwendolyn midlo hall says in st malcolm and the black revolution negro digest november spirituality is a powerful highly contagious emotion and in my view mankinds most profound emotion a revolution in the psyche of one man can become an allpowerful force for social change st malcolm was such a man we can now look at the festering sore the tragedy of our dream deferred malcolm our dream died unprotected i have said before see is the black revolutionist a phony in negro digest july brother malcolm was assassinated at the beginning of his revolutionary maturity because of our collective weakness countless other perverted atrocities are continually perpetrated on us because of our collective weakness brothers what i am driving at is for instance that if our historical enemy now practically our natural enemyknew that should anything have happened to brother malcolm there would be chaos in harlem that night that the following day there wouldnt be a single white store on th street that the very foundations of this system would have to cope with a black uncontrollable power the chances are that brother malcolm would still have been with us i have since realized that one of the major reasons malcolm died unprotected is that many of us who were supposed to did not actually know precisely who we were there is nothing unusual in this filthy world when a very concrete revolutionary man like malcolm is killed by the enemies and oppressors of black people in fact these sinister neoeuropean devils be they in africa asia south or north america have shown us in very exact terms what they are prepared to do to any people who are determined to control their own destiny if they cannot buy you off or scare you or turn you into some freak apologist of their hideous schemes then they organize to isolate and immobilize you or they will kill you we are familiar with what they have done to nkrumah sukarno robert williams mandela sobukwe agostinho neto they even killed luthuli and martin_luther_king who preached a peaceful alternative an appeal based on a level of morality the western whiteman is too beastly to deal with for his own salvation leroi jones has pointed out that the western whiteman cannot even feel because if he could he would feel the pain he is to the majority of the peoples on this planet at the time i am writing this piece these sinister maniacs are carrying out plans to either kill or immobilize every black man they consider a threat to american domestic colonialism and dollarism around the world what they are trying to do to huey newton rap brown eldridge cleaver leroi jones stokely carmichael to name a few is exactly what the french tried to do to the leadership of the algerian liberation front it has happened in all colonial countries i was in detroit recently and there were these devils on tv discussing how they were going to improve their methods of controlling us finally one of them gave the police commissioner orders to arrest brothers glanton dowdell and general baker as soon as any racial incidents broke out i suspect that not knowing precisely who we are we have not always been able to understand what we are up against very clearly the blackwhite relationships and struggle in this country as well as in africa the position of afroamericans in america is that of a colonized people there are three types of colonial situations the first kind is where the colonizers come into the country say as the english did in kenya then they oppress and exploit the people on african soil in the name of some country to which they owe allegiance the second kind of colonial situation is where the settler takes over the country as in south africa or zimbabwe break off ties with whatever european country they owed allegiance to and consider themselves african the amerindians also suffer this kind of colonialism in north america with the third kind european refugee bandits who have usurped a land area like north america oppress and exploit africans they brought over as slaves the conditions of africans under these three kinds of colonialism are the same though the tactics that the colonizer uses on the colonized might vary from place to place which is what malcolm kept hammering at over and over again so that we could better understand who we are in relation to the oppressor pointing out some significant things about the band ung conference malcolm said the same man that was colonizing our people in kenya was colonizing our people in the congo the same one in the congo was colonizing our people in south africa and in southern rhodesia zimbabwe and in burma and in india and in afghanistan and in pakistan they realized all over the world that where the dark man was being oppressed he was being oppressed by the white man where the dark man was being exploited he was being exploited by the white man if we understand this clearly then all the talk about injustice discrimination segregation lack of equality before the law or before any other white institution is just so much sterile crap a trap very carefully worked out by the oppressor to make sure that our minds and feelings remain imprecise as to who we are and what we can actually do but america is doomed as malcolm pointed out with poetic precision so is the rest of the colonial world because we are beginning to be clearer about our roots and identity the gateway to our powerful thrusts into the future with selfrespect malcolm preached a cultural return to africa a strong spiritual bond to guide our goals to guide the formulation of our ideology and the necessary revolutionary tactics and strategies we are beginning to understand who we are historically we are beginning to understand who we are socially our best possible usefulness to our communities we are beginning to understand who we are in our timethe direct relevance of our lives to our strong collective thrusts into the future we are beginning to clearly understand who we are politicallyour direct allegiances and alliances malcolms legacy malcolms purpose and direction malcolms impact on the black revolution the world over nationalism and panafrican unity these and many more of the practical manifestations of malcolms spirit the outer trimmings jones aptly described themhave been talked about in this magazine and many others so i consider it unnecessarily repetitious to talk about them one thing though i will point out malcolm like nkrumah toure moumie the cameroonian brother who the french poisoned with thallium nyerere fanon ho chi minhto name just a few among our many heroes who have earned our respecttaught us to get rid of our fear and cowardice and wage an uncompromising total struggle like our vietnamese brothers no concessions malcolm warned us because to look forward toand to expect concessions fromthe oppressor is to put yourself in to the trick bag the enemy has until recently been successful in placing us in the nature of this paradox is ridiculous i desire what i do not desire concessions lead you away from revolutionary struggle lessening your chances of liberation revolution is based on land land is the basis of all independence land is the basis of freedom justice and equality brother malcolm taught us because it is on land that a people builds a nation the setswana word for peace is kagisano which literally means building together brother malcolm continued revolution is bloody revolution is hostile revolution knows no compromise revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way look around you today look around the world if you need any evidence to verify the truth and validity of malcolms statements above and always remember this perceptive observation malcolm makes upon looking back at the intelligence of something he did at the age of all i had done was to improve on their strategy and it was the beginning of a very important lesson in my lifethat anytime you find someone more successful than you are especially when youre both engaged in the same businessyou know theyre doing something that you arent fanon demystified said to put africa in motion to cooperate in its organization in its regrouping behind revolutionary principles to participate in the ordered movement of a continentthis was really the work i had chosen understanding africa there to include african societies wherever they may be that too was malcolms spirit it is reoccurring in many of us today because there are memories between us deeper than grief there are feelings between us much stronger than the cold enemy machine that breaks the back there are places between us

salaam alaikum black roadblocks to black unity by dr alvin f poussaint and linda r mc lean he emergence of the black_power slogan in j june heralded e a new period in the philosophy of civil_rights organizations since then numerous allblack groups have formed throughout america these groups have sprung up not only in the black community but within previously integrated institutions thus we have black caucuses within religious and political organizations afroamerican societies formed on predominantly white college campuses an afro american teachers association and a black social workers association etc there are also various black economic and business organizations being formed these new groups are mushrooming at such a rapid rate that it is almost impossible to keep track of them or to adequately chronicle their formation this new drive for black unity solidarity represents a profound and significant new dimension of the racial struggle in america the formation of allblack political and social action organizations in the black communities is a relatively new phenomenon because of historical impediments both legal and extralegal which existed and which succeeded in promoting black fragmentation and group weakness for example during slavery blacks were disorganized and weakened as a group through the breakup of families and through the displacement and destruction of african culture and history to maintain control and to keep down rebellions whites forbade slaves from gathering together in significant numbers for meetings although group gatherings for religious worship were sometimes allowed by the slave master blacks were prevented from becoming literate so that they could not read and chronicle their experiences grievances and plans in any organized fashion more important however were the many psychological barriers and scars which prevented black organization especially if such organization was met with white disapproval the plantation system in itself implanted a dependency in the minds and behavior of the black man which was inimical to leadership it also prevented blacks from acquiring the skills of administration and control which are necessary for independence and success that is most of the slaves needsfinancial social and personalwere provided for by the master in this connection not only did the black man not have a chance to gain these skills he also never acquired feelings of competency in running things by himself child psychologists know that an important developmental task for youngsters is to have them do things independently in order to gain confidence in their ability to succeed overprotected children whose parents do everything for them often suffer from a lack of feelings of competency thus they often may not feel capable of undertaking projects on their own in addition slaves had limited opportunities to follow the leadership of other assertive and challenging blacks in a successful enterprise most black leadership as in slave revolts ended in failure which was negatively reinforcing blacks were encouraged to follow docile acceptable and whiteapproved leaders assertive systemchallenging blacks have always been feared by whites the racist elements in our society have systematically eliminated often with violence and murder blacks who were nonacquiescent or considered uppity niggers thus the types of skills necessary to satisfy the needs of ones own group which other ethnic groups acquired were never well developed in the black community and as a result blacks became dependent after slavery there was a void in the experiences of black people as well as psychological distrust of other blacks and their abilities to form successful organizations and to provide leadership black people had learned that white was right white was successful all around them and blacks were subservient for example blacks did not have to establish selfhelp organizations because the white boss provided for them the freedmens bureau like a benevolent father sought to take care of the black mans needs the presentday welfare system perpetuates this dependency blacks did not develop business associations of significance because the primary business among black people was the selling of their labor and the business end of such ventures was run by white men blacks were given their religion their language and their culture in addition since the large businesses corporations and industrial enterprises not only in america but in all of the industrialized western world were run by whites and evaluated as being better than nonindustrialized societies blacks had to feel that whites were more successful and capable in this area this lack of opportunity for black people to exercise control and independence has often left a void in the collective black psyche examples of blacks thirst for authority and leadership can be seen in a variety of work and religious situations slaves were preoccupied with imitating their masters and with giving orders this phenomenon was observed in nazi concentration camps and has been noted among groups which are kept subservient the opening scene in the movie gone with the wind shows a black field hand yelling quittin time immediately another slave says youre not supposed to say quittin time im supposed to say it whereupon he proceeds to call out the order himself as this scene exemplifies such small amounts of power were so important that slaves could seriously fight for a modicum of authority house servants felt superior to field hands because their work was inside where they ran the kitchen they took care of the household and they had responsibility even if it was under supervision in religious groups from slavery times to the present there has been a great deal of emphasis placed on positions offices and authority churches which were the only legitimate black organizations to which slaves could belong had ministers deacons elders ushers and all sorts of petty officers today we can see this emphasis on positions in black groups in fact black social and religious groups are frequently plagued by internal discord petty bickering distrust and jealousies among the membership the formality and organization within some black groups make one think that often more emphasis is placed on form than on function and on rules than on programs therefore in understanding present black organizations two things must be brought to the forefront black people suffered from a deficit of experiences in organizing running things successfully and exerting power black people never had much of a chance to follow other black leaders in succesful enterprises rather they saw whites as the successful leaders businessmen and politicians and were always led by them the brief experiences of black men in politics during reconstruction were shortlived and sorely maligned in history afterwards as being corrupt inept ignorant and disastrous consequently although blacks abilities in working cooking and taking care of children were recognized they were never allowed to be in charge today blacks can cook in restaurants but they do not own and run them until recently they could provide entertainment but not own record companies radio stations or have their own television programs they could design clothes shoes hats for someone else but not produce and manufacture them in the old tradition they gave or sold their services but never capitalized on them and organized them for their own gains an awareness of this black experience which historically has overwhelmingly witnessed white leadership is very important when seeking to understand the internal problems which plague black organizations today in previous papers it was suggested that black civil_rights workers blamed the presence of whites for the failure of these groups to accomplish more in terms of programs and change however after the whites left the problems of group organization and effectiveness remained the types of problems and handicaps which exist in the operations of many allblack groups make it amazing and commendable that so much has been accomplished by them the fact that despite a multitude of handicaps black people have seen the need and expressed the desire to organize testifies to their fortitude perseverence flexibility and determination it is hoped that the documentation of these typical dysfunctional and counterproductive mechanisms will enable such groups to identify and to eliminate barriers to their successful operations some of these phenomena have been identified as disruptive to the smooth functioning of any group these factors can be found in the vast sociological and psychological literature on the formation and functioning of groups and group dynamics other problems appear to be endemic to negro groups we have already mentioned a deficit in organizational and leadership skills which originally handicaps black groups second we have pointed to the lack of successful black leadership models in the past from this tradition has emerged a very serious problem of which many leaders of many black groups are probably aware this is the basic distrust and lack of confidence which many blacks have in black leadership because of projected feelings of selfhatred and inferiority black leaders have often found it difficult to get other black people to follow them it seems as though a lot of black people distrust the intentions and abilities of any black person who tries to lead a group comments such as who does he think he is and he dont know nothin are typically directed towards a potential organizer blacks have seen white success and black failure all of their lives they thus question the skills as well as the motives of a person trying to lead them they have been betrayed by blacks who have soldout or sold them down the river therefore they often wonder whats in it for him along with the basic distrust are the more serious selfhatred feelings many blacks shudder at having to do with any organization that is allblack black symbolizes inferiority allblack groups signify an imposed forced segregation which blacks have fought against all of their lives some negro leaders can see no good inand will have nothing to do withallblack groups because they see these as further institutionalizing segregation and legitimizing inferiority thus to them anything allblack has to be stigmatized and inferior this question has many ramifications that do not permit adequate discussion here are all black institutions and situations inherently inferior is inferiority or pathology inherent in the fact that a group or institution is allblack or is it a matter of how they got to be allblack most black institutions have arisen out of a forced segregation and oppression and so tend to be inferior if the oppression is lifted it is quite conceivable that an allblack school or community could be of high quality because many blacks may shun anything that is allblack or any group that is led by a black person we see this selfhatred becoming counterproductive to black organizations dynamically a person says black is inferior i hate myself because i am black and therefore inferior this group of allblacks is inferior so i hate it and will not work with it or destroy itthis strong feeling against black leaders and the preference for white leaders is so prevalent that many major black organizations have white men at the heads trustees governing boards etc it is almost ludicrous to think of a black person leading the american jewish congress bnai brith or the united jewish appeal in fact you would not even find a gentile in this position it is ridiculous to think of a caucasian or a black heading the chinese businessmens association or a nonethnic member being president of an irish or italian group however it has been very typical to see whites as leaders and board members of major black organizations there is nothing wrong with having white persons as members of black organizations however there is a big difference between having white members of predominantly black organizations and having whites as leaders and policymakers of these organizations another factor which plagues black organizations once they are establishedalthough this is also a factor that is disruptive when it occurs in any groupis the cathartic needs and domineering attitudes of some of their members anyone who has attended meetings of some black organizations is familiar with the type of person who demonstrates a profound need to speak out to get angry to show how bad and militant he is and who monopolizes the time of the group by dominating and intimidating other group members this type of behavior probably is prevalent because blacks have had the opportunity to openly and publicly express their anger and hatred towards whites this behavior is often exaggerated by the excessive use of profane language and personal threats which such individuals direct towards other members this may serve an important function in satisfying the personal needs of some group members however often this type of behavior prevents programs from being formed and remedies carried out while these persons may satisfy their own needs to sound off many times they become fixated at this point and cannot move on to more productive behavior since such behavior is destructive to the group it may be a manifestation of selfhatred feelings displaced to the allblack group thus these persons present roadblocks because not only do they take up valuable time they also prevent others from saying or doing anything constructive this type of behavior has interesting psychiatric psychological bases roots the excessive nature of these outbursts and the inappropriate emotions and affect associated with their delivery in part stem from repressed rage and unexpressed anger many of the individuals who are attracted to a group meeting walk around without expressing their anger towards white people and their rage at being oppressed thus when given a safe forum such as the confines of an allblack meeting their release of pentup frustrations is like the bursting of a dam there is another very important phenomenon seen in the behavior of some leaders of black organizations which has a devastating effect on the credibility of these leaders and on their ability to attract a following many of the most militantsounding antiwhite talking young men contradict all they say in action by dating white girls or militant black women date white men it is obvious that the talk of black pride and unity of how black is beautiful and how beautiful it is to be black and of how white people are racists ring hollow when the same person who attempts to influence the populace is seen dating the enemy so to speak this behavior suggests that such a militant is caught up in a reaction formation when he becomes militantly black but he really believes white is right the main problem with this behavior for the effective functioning of black organizations is that it tends to fragment groups and weaken a leaders ability to be convincing the followers see this leader through his actions as being hypocritical dishonest or just messed up therefore he cuts down on his leadership potential still another occurrence which often drastically undercuts the smooth operations of some black organizations involves the tremendous status needs which many members and leaders have the personal desire for individual attention and recognition which many of these individuals demonstrate in their behavior and the tendency to build personality cults rather than strong organizations lead to severe competition discord and antagonism as well as neglect of group goals for example the tremendous needs for personal glory and adulation both within and outside the group which individuals have lead many persons in black organizations to be stubborn obstinate intractible and unyielding in their attitudes opinions and positions they often may refuse to cooperate on group projects to compromise their ideas or positions or to think in terms of what is best for the group or the goals of an organization rather than what will bring selfaggrandizement such needs for status in blacks may stem from basic feelings of worthlessness and inferiority because they are blacks in a white racist society therefore a large proportion of time and energy is expended and wasted fighting personal battles and being preoccupied with petty behavior this very often sabotages the programs of organizations creates personality camps hardens feelings and causes a breakdown in effective programming and operations we have discussed six major problems which typically plague black organizations and which hamper their effective operations in addition to internal factors however there are external pressures which impede the success of allblack organizations one such external factor is the lack of financial support which is given to black organizations by other blacksespecially the black middle class along with the abhorence of things allblack and the pursuit of things allwhite goes much of the black middleclass financial support many middleclass blacks will support white charitable organizations financially however few of them will provide financial support to mostlyblack groups such as the black muslims core or even sclc and the naacp the dynamics and motivations involved here are complex although interesting for some blacks the ability to give money to white groups allows them to gain acceptance and to participate and feel like everybody else some blacks do not see allblack groups as worthwhile in addition to support them forces them to recognize that there is a need for a separate black organization and that there may be problems which pertain solely to them as blacks because of racism this may force them to acknowledge that all is not well and that they are not really accepted on the basis of their individual merits and accomplishments this phenomenon of nonsupport is seen even among verbal militants as one black spokesman said there are lots of cats walking around with natural hair and processed minds thus some individuals who advance their black identity verbally and visibly never put their money where their mouths are in the final analysis it has been white money which has provided the major financial support for civil_rights organizations in the program area black organizations many times experience difficulty in defining their problems discreetly and setting realistic goals because of the overwhelming number of problems which black people face in american society and the pervasiveness and interrelatedness of multiple problems it is often difficult to define problems and to set realistic goals a group very often defines its problems too broadly sets out to solve all of the ills of black people in society and consequently ends up entirely frustrated and discouraged instead of deciding for example to tackle the one area such as employment or particular industries which discriminate or to work on educational barriers or particular school problems a group may decide that it wants to end discrimination in jobs housing and education it may decide to gain jobs housing and freedom now this global definition of goals is unpenetrable and therefore frustrating if a group does not isolate a by harold w cruse from julian j tt v mayfields challenge to my bestseller the crisis of the negro intellectual it is revealed that his feelings have been deeply lashed he speculates with grief that if i had become rich and famous we might have been spared this spiteful book at the beginning of his challenge he asserts that when he picked up my book which began with such promise he had great expectations for reading a work of criticism an area in which we have not yet achieved distinction however after reading it he regrets the painful necessity of having to report that the crisis is a glaring failure and worse its good he knows we lack critical distinction in passing to the meat of his challenge he says that the book will be a brisk seller especially on college campuses despite the expensive price it was at this crucial point that i began to hurt badly because he is misquoting my price which is downright unethical of himimagine cutting into my campus sales like that i am indignant the real price is which is a way of avoiding saying and change as a result of this unfair trade practice of misquoting my sellout price to the campus establishment i am in more fiscal pain than is mayfield in critical discomfiture of course mayfield need not have pained himself into his sorrowful decision of putting down my book as an unmitigated failure i would rather he did it with gleeful chuckles inspired by the certain knowledge that he had killed all possible brisk sales off the campuses if not on but alas alack mayfield suspects otherwise painfully and so he wishes the book had never been written and the issues in the book had never been reused in such a painful way but how does one raise painful issues without pain i commiserate with mayfields politically thin skin criticism on the issues especially those he didnt discuss are indeed a hard school and mr mayfield has not been accustomed to this sort of thing although he and i are products of the same political tradition we came from different sides of the railroad tracks in a manner of speaking unlike myself mayfield never received critical assaults before because he never raised any critical issues while in the communist left i can boast of a long record of raising issues in the communist left and getting raked for it while mayfield and his friends were conforming and performing for their privileges it is these friends of his that he unconsciously refers to when he wishes that we might have been spared my spiteful book also negro digest readers should not believe that mayfield really expected anything from my book but what he got he knew what to expect because its a cinch he had already been told our mutual animosity and divergence of views had been established as far back as and in an article on the communist left which i published in the studies on the left inspired mayfield to write john henrik clarke a letter containing the statement that cruse ought to be lynched at least that was the way clarke relayed it to me verbally mind you there was nothing about mayfields personal commitments mentioned in that article still from way over there in ghana mayfield bristled like an angry rooster in the red barnyard yet when it comes to a discussion of the issues raised in my bestseller he acts like an intellectual chicken hiding his thin skin behind a cackling barrage of barnyard gossip but this has always been characteristic of the colored section of the communist left which included a dull collection of intellectual yesmen yeahwomen yea sayers and trained apologists for communist party irrelevancies on black reality nothing unsettled them and made them bristle selfrighteously more than a threat of criticism all through my communist career and even after all that i ever got from the likes of richard b moore hope stevens lorraine hansberry and her freedom newspaper circle and other lesser bureaucrats of negro marxiana was the intolerance and exclusiveness of cliques the arrogance of a privileged caste the closedminded rigidity of a bureaucracy whose status was predicated not on anything politically creative but on a hackneyed political line dating back to the s these are the we for whose feelings mayfield is hurting ever since mayfield first arrived belatedly in he has tried mightily for the role of a frontrunner like one very ambitious to star in the eyes of his more experienced colleagues that he was the first to answer my book with a written dissent is typical of mayfield the frontrunner yet of all the individuals who are mentioned in my book mayfield is by all odds among the least knowledgeable and experienced he cant give the otherside of very much that happened in harlem for the simple reason that he came too late and wasnt around very long after this is the real reason he cant discuss issues it is not because of my distortions it is because mayfield doesnt know very much he is not a harlemite and knows next to nothing about harlem communist party happenings from to because by his own admission he didnt graduate from high school until in washington dc after that he went into the army and to college in he took up theater and got a role in the andersonweill production of lost in the stars which did not close until late or early by the time he arrived in harlem the main fireworks of were over even then his participation was marginal to the fundamental political and cultural issues that had been argued out and fought over by the postwar younger wave of communists after a brief stint with the committee for the negro in the arts freedom newspaper the harlem writers guild and some play productions mayfield was off to puerto rico where he remained the greater part of the s it was from puerto rico that he published his first novels which were peddled for him by someone else in the meantime i and others had to uphold his right to go to puerto rico against the snide criticism of some downtown white communists who charged mayfield with running out i vocally upheld his privilege of leaving the country even though i hardly knew him personally despite my dislike for indulging in personal issues in what is purported to be an exchange of critical opinions on political and cultural issues one must often descend to such tactics when mayfield asserts that the victims of my destructive thrust are not the valid ones of wrong obsolete and untenable ideas and attitudes but a long list of artists and intellectuals many of them dead whom mr cruse happens not to like he is absolutely rightthat is in part a few of them i definitely did not like at all others i had no personal rancor against but simply didnt think much of their work or their intellectual stature for example i think both langston hughes and loften mitchell were real nice guys whom i liked an awful lot i simply think however that a lot of langston hughes work poetry excepted was simply sloppy simplistic unpolished and of generally deteriorating quality from the s onwards i dont believe loften mitchell one of my best friends reached any real expertise as a playwright everybody raved about john o killens youngblood however i personally found it impossible to finish this novel because it had absolutely no style in the writing and reflected a social point of view which was for me naive and oversimplistic and sociologically superficial in addition to this killens has an inflated ego which is not justified in the real light of his work i considered killens war novel and then we heard the thunder his best work but also predicted that when killens would be forced to depart from autobiographical material for his thematic ideas he would lapse his last novel sippi proves this for me it is a failure an embarrassing flop which didnt surprise me at all perhaps killens will prove for me that he can write a good nonautobiographical novel but i doubt it these doubts are based not so much on personal feelings as they are on what i perceive in the novelists social outlook which is highly egostistical but often corny and also limited in terms of social perceptions on the blackwhite thing when such an outlook is also permeated with leftwing ideology it is not a point of view that is amenable to much perception in the handling of human materials this becomes a critical and cultural problem of no mean proportions let us discuss miss lorraine hansberry and the freedom newspaper episodes mayfield mentions he complains that i mention her name more than i do web du bois i mentioned mayfields name less than either of them but he is screaming the most in pain mayfield refuses to accept my stated premise for writing my book i made it more than clear in the first pages that i was about to critically dissect the role of the black creative and professional intellectual beginning with james baldwin and his contemporaries in the course of the book i also dealt with some of the historical antecedents that have influenced these contemporary creative intellectuals naturally i deal most thoroughly with those whom i have known personally more or less before mayfield arrived at freedom newspaper i met miss hansberry there mayfield from his marginal contact with harlem realities wonders what was i doing in freedoms office well long before mr mayfield arrived i had been to freedoms office with the proposal that in addition to writing for that journal i would also see that paul robesons paper got distributed to all the harlem newsstands along lenox and seventh avenues this kind of work it may be noted was not the kind of work the freedom staff nor mayfields friends were at all interested in dirtying their hands with but i am not proud in that respect moreover we postwar harlem communists had been taught the necessity of doing all kinds of unglamorous chores such as street speaking and demonstrating newspaper selling block and house canvassing veterans work tenants work leaflet distributing fund collecting putting dispossessed peoples furniture back in their homes fending off police harassment etc etc this was the side of harlem communist activity mayfield never experienced but inside freedom newspaper office i met lorraine hansberry and found her attitude downright insulting both class and castewise besides that she was demonstrably antimale especially towards those she considered socially beneath her i noticed that eslanda goode robeson hardly ever looked at anyone in freedoms office she didnt personally know robeson himself i found usually morose and uncommunicative in contrast to the public face he usually put up for me who had been with robeson during both peekskill uprisings in and was also one of the personal guards assigned to him after the riots when he made personal appearances in new york this was not an encouraging closeup all in all i grew to dislike the freedom newspaper staff they probably didnt like me either because i was too outspoken for their tastes so the feeling was mutual its been mutual ever since except for robeson i had no respect for their abilities or their leadership pretentions in the journalistic fields i was never impressed with either lorraine hansberrys writing abilities nor her ideas after she became famous aside from personal considerations and attitudes i considered it necessary to say these things in a book of social political literary and cultural criticism all of julian mayfields novels were overrated works and at the age of mayfield has not matured as a novelist these are serious questions that should be critically debated by and for all those seriously concerned with black cultural problems in america mayfield believes that a lot of my harsh judgment stems from my own personal disappointments in the theater and he is absolutely correct but that is only a small part of it my own failures in the theater is nobodys fault but my own inasmuch as i never will write plays or anything else to suit anyones a priori tastes hence the story mayfield tells about my asking lorraine hansberry to read a musical play of mine is an apochryphal yarn that someone told him i never spoke to hansberry but two or three times in on freedom newspaper and never had words with her again in fact i never knew hansberry was even in terested in theater until her play raisin in the sun was produced in i never knew her well enough to ask her anything of that nature i will not go so far as to say that mayfield is lying for effect because it is very obvious that someone from freedoms staff told him this i have been my own harshest critic when it comes to judging my own plays none of them have been good enough to warrant my sustained effort to get them produced more than that all plays soon become dated and one must get on to new ideas my chief gripe about the theater is that we have no theater institution in which to experiment with new play ideas therefore i soon become disinterested not only with what i have written but with the theater generally thus merely to get a play produced was never for me a life and death matter neither was getting rich and famous as mayfield intimates i could have done that too a long time ago by concocting stuff for hollywood at least i had offers this does not mean that i would object to being rich and famous it only means that getting rich and famous must come as a result of the righ creative and critical standards i set for myself as a creative individual as for mayfields moral posturing over my drinking water incident in the cuban hills he reminds me of an old gossiping spinster digging up dirt about her social rivals in an old maids coterie sure i complained about water and vocally some of us came down with severe cases of dysentery from being forced to drink water from impure springs as guests of the cuban government we had every right to complain mayfield however true to political leftwing methods of prosecution of enemies of the revolution blows up this incident into a belligerent threat against the cuban revolution unlike the hansberry allegations which was gossip someone passed on to him this time mayfield concocts a scurrilous lie about what i actually said moreover the person i complained to was no mere aide who spoke no english but the cuban poet pablo armando fernandez it is a pity that this type of political scuttlebutt should enter into this exchange but the reader should note that it is an example of the venom that accumulates in the spate of personal attacks characteristic of communist leftwing polemics i believe leroi jones was present at this completely insignificant incident and i doubt he would corroborate this falsehood while we are on this interesting question of political gossip i have an excellent suggestion for julian mayfieldas a writer of some talent mayfield is missing his own boat in the department of literary originality and sophistication he is keeping his public ignorant of some real juicy bits of scandal simply dripping with human and political er and also cultural interest relating to his short harlem writers club period in new york which also has political and human cultural connections with his glorious sojourn in the puerto rican sunshine durante y bajo el encanto de la amor grande y amorosa pardon my french this idyllic escapade to the caribbean blue surf also carried itself across the great deep to our ancestral sod in ghana i say our only as a sop to african unity cause after all my folks were pure zulu who tell me they never had anything to do with them ghanaians and that i shouldnt associate with them cause they left them white folks enslave them but i dont pay any tention to that garbage cause my folks were rather oldfashioned and conservative im with the new african unity thing now where were we oh yesmayfield with his gift of literary declamation went through that swingin odyssey and aint told us a blessed thing about it now if that har lem writers club only had a black henry miller running their literary workshop instead of john oliver killens man alive that cat would have told us an eroticculturalliterary narrative that would have made henry millers tropics of cancer and capricorn read like a cheap sex novel about sexually deprived white folks stranded on an equatorial island in the pacific trying to negotiate foreign aid programs for the natives now please julian mayfields response te harold cruse here is no need to reply at length to mr cruses pathetic attempt to cut my gums out the level of his attack should make it clear to any sensitive reader that the main thrust of my reviewarticle in which i called into question the authors basic integrity was substantially correct what for example are we to make of a wouldbe political pundit who seems to have filled his notebook with speculation about the sexual lives of people who always avoided him like the plague how are we to regard a man who fancies himself as a latterday frantz fanon but who demands of me that i join him in repeating the scurrilous rumors circulated in the western press about the private life of ghanas president kwame nkrumah mr cruse has never visited ghana nor indeed any other region of africa and his admirers should wonder why he the ultrablack nationalist derives so much satisfaction from an attempt to discredit the most progressive and prophetic leader black africa has ever had this brings us to a serious inadequacy in the authors preparation which is reflected in his work mr cruse has never been anywhere and i certainly understand why he resents those who did leave home the fact that he has as a writer seldom left new york city is not a virtue but a grave liability this accounts for the myopic inference in his book that everything worth mentioning about black intellectuals happened in manhattan thus he largely neglects chicago which has always rivaled new york as a center of black intellectual ferment washington nashville atlanta and lately los angeles are cities where black people are cooking on ideas that may have an even more profound impact on the resolution of the crisis of black intellectualism than atypical new york in such an unlikely place as cleveland there are at least a score of young black intellectuals and artists who are determined one way or the other to build a new city but of these developments mr cruse seems blithely unaware both greyhound and trailways send buses to these cities everyday and one would have thought that his publishers would have advanced him the fare then he might have understood that the intellectual brew stirring in our communities has little resemblance to the situation of those of us associated with the political left in the early postwar period my principal reason for rejecting mr cruse as a critic pundit or seer has nothing to do with anything as irrelevent as his sex life or even the fact that in all his years he has never written or done anything meaningful so that we might judge him by his work it is simply that mr cruse does not know and not knowing should not presume to lead the average young brother and sister in the struggle whether an intellectual or not has never met an american communist yet mr cruse would have them divert their energies to a meaningless struggle that has not had significance since he was a young man in the crisis of the negro intellectual general cruse leads us to the wrong battlefield american disciples of karl marx may have done childe harold wrong but that is harolds hangup now our basic problem is how to survive in and rid ourselves of the most dangerous oppressive and imperialistic power structure the world has ever known mr cruse has a good mind and might be able to help if he did not spend so much time peeping into bedroom keyholes the black student and the brother in the streets by vernon j dixon he call is out to enroll the skills and analytical tools of the black student in furthering and shaping the black revolution in effect this call has been heeded already by those afroamerican students for whom identification with their brothers in the street does not present any difficulty the problem which arises however for these black students is concern for selecting the most viable response the feeling of oneness with his black brethren was clearly evident at an east coast conference of black students a few days after the violent expression of black anger provoked by the assassination of martin_luther_king jr one student stated the strongest feeling of the group when he asked agonizingly my black brothers are getting shot down out there what am i doing here in effect the group was seeking the optimal form to give their identification this question is more specific for the black graduate student he already possesses skills needed in the black community therefore he must compare the benefits of increasing his skills with the costs of foregoing immediate use of these skills in the black community thus for a significant number of black university and college students the prime concern is how to relate to the brothers in the street unfortunately to a large extent the process of analyzing the question occurs within an academic and social structure erected on the white american experience by definition in such an environment the black student does not find any major institutional support for his evolving black consciousness awareness acceptance articulation and development of the black experience so vital to completing the framework for resolving the question while the particular answer to this question will reflect the individuality of the black student it occurs to me that it is crucial that he understand clearly how american values are influencing him as h rap brown has said its whats in your head not whats on your head this point cannot be stressed too strongly in any theory or model which the black student develops in any policy recommendation which he derives from that theory and in concrete action which he undertakes based on that policy american values determine the very structure and direction of this process of postulation theorizing policy formulation and concrete implementation this paper explores the mind set of american values and how it may affect the choice of the black student in determining his mode of interaction with the brother in the street to unravel and to comprehend fully the operation of the american value construct requires a thirdeye view ie the black student must exercise his analytical ability to transcend his mind set this is necessary because members of universities and colleges have implanted deeply in his mind that the essential values of american civilization remain universal and eternal while simultaneously ignoring all the blunders white americans have made the american value matrix which i discuss in this paper consists of advocacy of individualism the apotheosis of the individual advocacy of the literal tradition which is construed to exclude the figurative tradition advocacy of reason rather than emotion as the final arbiter of human affairs k before showing the linkage between these individual values in the american mind set and their effect on the black students selection of a mode of interacting with his brethren i must point out that i am no more arguing for the primacy and universality of the opposites of these values than i am for the values themselves indeed elsewhere i have set forth a way of perceiving and organizing experiences which confirms without inherent tension the copresence of differing value constructs here i want only to examine the american mind set of values so that the black student may become conscious of the way in which it determines how he decides to interact with the brothers in the street thus some unconscious operation may become conscious and therefore offer a greater spectrum of alternatives to the black student in selecting his way of participating in the black revolution the first american value in the mind set which the black student should consider is individualism by this term i mean the apotheosis of the individual which signifies the elevation of the individual to the level of a god there is no conception of the group as a whole except as a collection of individuals each individual is defined exclusively by the way in which he differs from other individuals rather than by the way in which he is similar to them by that definition each individual exists uniquely ie the individual has the godlike properties of oneness and uniqueness in attempting to attain these characteristics the individual is apotheosizing himself individualism in this sense has important implications for the black student as he chooses his lorm of identification with his brothers in the street for example a black student who has used his skills and analytical tools to formulate a theory or to erect a model which incorporates the black experience will often be criticized by his fellow black students to the effect what you have to say is fine and good but will it reach the brother in the street can he dig what you have to say i will discuss later the implications of this remark about the ability of the brothers in the street to comprehend theoretical statements and complex propositions but for the moment i only want to suggest how that remark may reflect individualism which in turn confines the black student the black student who is predisposed towards selfapotheosis knows empirically that individuals have both unique and similar characteristics therefore the black student who desires to validate the primacy of his person must seek confirmation of his selfdeification this may be accomplished by taking his output theories models policies actions directly to the brothers in the street for their approval or disapproval having determined his brothers position the black student converts their approval or disapproval into a measure of his selfapotheosis as a result of this process the output of the black student and his assessment of his own apotheosis have become equivalent it follows that even though the concerns of the brothers in the street are the inputs analyzed by the black student the motivating force of individualism or selfapotheosis demands that his output be directly evaluated by his black brethren in the street however that requirement of direct evaluation severely constrains his output in the absence of individualism the black student is no longer directed towards his own private ends and therefore his analytical ability and skills are not used to produce output for direct evaluation by the brothers in the street models theories policies and actions not previously considered can be undertaken whether useful now or later whether approved or not approved by the brethren that output truly enlarges the spectrum of alternative definitions of the black experience in this context therefore all output derived from the input of black experience furthers the black revolution moreover the student can now allow that output to reach the brothers in the street through the mediation of other brothers without the limitation of individualism the black student has a wider range from which to select his mode of relating to his brothers in the street before discussing the other elements in the american value matrix i think the black student should realize that his concern about reaching the brothers in the street may reflect his desire to receive the adoration of his brethren in this case the black student usually acts out that desire in becoming a leader his output elicits direct approval from the brothers and he in turn has influence over their actions however the black student who seeks that approval in order to assess the primacy of himself is acting within the confines of individualism in effect that approval serves for him as the adoration necessary to confirm his selfapotheosis receiving approval and exerting influence on this basis the black student leads the black revolution along an extremely narrow road of development for a black leader influenced by individualism will not only reject output theories models policies actions from other brothers but he will also restrict the formulation of his own output such a leader will accept another brothers output only when it can be presented as originating with him in this way he seeks to maintain the adoration of the brethren in the street underlying this reaction is the fear that the primacy of his leadership will be weakened if not eliminated all this is consistent with the black leaders selfapotheosis furthermore he will perceive the true concerns of the brethren only when they concur with his own if the black revolution calls for output which will undermine the black leaders selfapotheosis and lessen his adoration he will not be able to hear the call and develop the appropriate output himself as a result this type of leader hinders the black revolution unfortunately the desire for adoration in order to confirm the primacy of self is reinforced and implemented through the other two components of the american value matrix the literal tradition and the superiority of reason the second constituent in the mind set of american values which influences the black student is the advocacy of the literal tradition compared to the figurative tradition in this paper a literal tradition signifies the tendency to construe words oral or written in their denotative sense the importance of this stress on logical clarity is seen in the increasing trend of using mathematical language in various disciplines consequently the black student is trained to express exactly what he means if imagination is viewed as the power to represent the real more fully and truly than it appears to the senses then in figurative language imagination is actually embodied within the words in literal language imagination occurs as a result of the individuals response to the subject matter rather than to the connotation of the words themselves for example there are some white people who still believe that the word brother used among black people signifies a blood relationship compared to the literal tradition the figurative language has marvelous complexity and originality examples of this are constantly produced in current speech to some brothers in the street the words negro and uncle tom while figurative were yet too literal they wanted a word which when contraposed to black would characterize a person as one of color on the outside and white inside and the word would also indicate simultaneously the persons entire position toward the black revolution as one reflecting white racist attitudes toasty the word is a perfect illustration of the figurative tradition the problem for the black student however is the implications of the american mind set which asserts the literal tradition as the superior tradition if the black student accepts uncritically his proficiency in literal language as superior to figurative language he will limit his range of choice in se c lecting modes of relating to the brothers in the street this will occur in two ways through false perceptions of the brethrens ability to comprehend complex propositions and through implementing the motivation of the black student to become an apotheosistic leader concerning the first limiting effect the black student who emphasizes the literal tradition without scrutiny closes avenues of reaching the brothers in the street this student may fail to recognize that the figurative language of the black community contains extraordinarily complex nuances and profound ideas they have not been articulated in the literal form as leroi jones has pointed out when a blind hopeless black preacher says god dont never change a precise thing is being said the preacher does not mean god does not ever change he means exactly god dont never change in terms of the human referent of the black community this is a profound statement on the deterministic order of the world in effect the figurative language of the brother in the street has its own logical clarity there is a failure to perceive this complex system of expression when the black student accepts the literal tradition as the superior one consequently if the complexity in the figurative tradition is not rec w ognized then the ability of the users of that language to comprehend involved propositions is not perceived a broader avenue to discerning the interests of the brothers in the street is closed this may be inferred from the remark of the black students mentioned previously ie what you have to say is fine and good but can the brothers dig it to such black students complex ideas can not reach the brothers in the street because the brethren are not capable of understanding them all propositions must be simple so they can dig what you say it follows that no attempt is made to explore systematically the figurative tradition of the brothers in the street in order to preserve to enrich and to develop the strengths of that tradition and to communicate figuratively to the brethren their meaning for black identity the second way in which acceptance of the superiority of the literal tradition limits modes of relating is through implementing the tendency of the black student to become a leader in order to achieve his own apotheosis since the black student is conversant with both languages the literal group requires him to serve as their translator of the figurative tradition it is quite easy for the black student to use literal language as a tool to prove to the literal group that only he can interpret to them the concerns of the brothers in the street should this student be motivated at the same time by selfapotheosis it follows for him that only he can lead the brethren moreover in relating to the figurative group such a leader will use the literal language to falsely discredit any challenges to his selfapotheosis he demands that the threatening brother in the street state his ideas in literal form define your terms and say exactly what you mean during the time this type of leader is functioning through language manipulation he hinders development of the black revolution since he cannot recognize the ability of the brethren to comprehend complex propositions such a leader can neither perceive nor translate the true concerns of the black community if at any time he does so it will be fortuitous and not the result of communication with the group additionally he cannot communicate with the brethren on a complex figurative level thereby being unable in a broad sense to perform an educational role thus a black student who seeks selfdeified leadership has at best a narrow range of approaches to interacting with his brothers these avenues of communication are not widened by the influence of the third element in the mind set of american values the stress on reason over and against emotion the advocation of reason as the final arbiter in human affairs together with the two preceding components of the value matrix reduce alternative forms of identification before the black student can see this linkage he must recognize the connection between the process of reasoning and the process of administrationthe latter being a common way in which a black student relates to his brethren reason in one sense signifies the capacity to extract implications from a combination of facts or suppositionsthe power of comprehending and inferring inherent in this process is that particular act of transcending the apparent meaning of the combination in order to comprehend and infer a further meaning which was not immediately apparent this act i have termed overviewing an administrator performs this same function of overviewing when he coordinates activity to accomplish some common purpose if reasoning is viewed as superior it is very easy to transfer this same superiority to the process of administration indeed to an administrator motivated by selfapotheosis the act of overviewing can be interpreted by him as evidence of his primacy moreover inherent in the administrative process is the discretionary power to select based on his overview the optimal way of achieving a common goal to a selfapotheosistic administrator the way chosen must be optimal for the true concerns of the group in effect this type of black administrator like the corresponding leader causes the same harm that results from a narrow range of approaches to interacting with the brother in the street unfortunately this harm is increased when such an administrator also accepts the literal tradition as the superior one on one side this type of administrator cannot recognize ideas expressed figuratively on the other side the brother in the street cannot express these ideas literally therefore a selfapotheosistic black administrator cannot overview the true interests of the brethren and he probably will not select the optimal approach to their attainment consequently in becoming an administrator or a leader the black student selects as his form of identification one which can be most destructive to the black revolution if it is determined by the entire american value matrix it is now clear that this mind set of values reduces the alternatives open to the black student the implications for the student who transcends that mind set are too numerous to be exhausted here the black community will offer him many opportunities which have not yet been realized in turn this may lead him to formulate new postulates theories policies and actions if he approaches the black community unhandicapped he may discover such strengths as nonindividualistic concern for communal interests the institution of the extended family and rich cultural forms of which the figurative tradition is only one instance these may stimulate him to develop meaningful output which will preserve those strengths without transforming them into a new value matrix which is advocated as universal and eternal the black student who becomes a leader or an administrator could then regard himself as a man of the hour one who is entrusted temporarily with the implementation of the brethrens interest but who also generates his own replacement by the appropriate means thus the wider range of alternatives available to the black student provide greater potentiality for a successful black revolution by pfumo dzvuku n may the united nations security council unanimously passed a britishsponsored resolution enjoining all members of the un to impose total trade and economic sanctions against southern rhodesia the resolution was only the latest of several others adopted by various organs of the world organization against the rebellious british colony in which white settlers have carved a cosy niche for themselves by suppressing nearly african inhabitants of the country on last june the british house of lords defeated its own governments orderincouncil seeking to validate the un sanctions program at this writing the labor government of prime minister harold wilson was reported preparing another order which it was expected would be adopted by both houses of the british parliament what it may be asked do these developments mean what in fact is the essence of the rhodesian problem and how effectively may we expect international action to help resolve it there are two important factors underlying the whole rhodesia problem which deserve more attention than has been given them in all the diplomatic manoeuvring at the un and in all the innumerable commentaries that have been written on the issue failure to analyse and articulate these factors has led to a lot of wishful thinking and the flourishing of rampant hypocrisy the two most important factors underlying the rhodesian problem relate to the countrys position as an integral part of the geopolitics of southern africa and to the role of britain itself in the emergence and consolidation of minority settler hegemony in that unhappy country rhodesia has developed historically as an extension of south africa culminating with the present situation in which she has become a south african satellite as for britain her role has consisted in condoning and encouraging the processes whereby rhodesia has become a pocketsize south africa taking these factors into account and having regard to the western worlds massive and abiding support of south africa the un sanctions against rhodesia cannot but prove hollow and pathetically futile they cannot succeed because they have been formulated on the erroneous assumption that rhodesia can be totally quarantined and left to suffocate slowly to death but this cannot be done because rhodesiadue to economic diplomatic and racial factorsprobably can boast richer and more reliable friends than any african country she certainly cannot be economically ruined let alone starved to death by the kind of resolution that the un recently passed rhodesias links with south africa date back to the countrys colonization towards the end of the th century that colonization was spearheaded by arch empirebuilder cecil rhodes a british african tycoon and onetime prime minister of the cape colony now cape province of south africa by use of trickery and armed might the country was won for the british empire in the band of marauders used for this purpose were hired in south africa at rhodes own expense despite their determined and heroic resistance particularly between and the africans of zimbabwe the countrys proper name were finally subdued and foreign rule firmly installed from that time on rhodesia developed virtually as an appendage of south africa roads railroads communication lines etc were established linking the country with south africa moreover south africa supplied most of the new colonys needs of imported capital and consumer goods of various kinds in addition to this rhodesia provided a convenient haven for any spillover of south africas white population so that as of today well over percent of the settler population of rhodesia is of south african origin as might be expected the effect of these developments was that rhodesias economic political and social institutions and practices emerged basically as faithful replicas of south african patterns and practices not surprisingly therefore all the ugly features of south african apartheid have come to have very close parallels in rhodesiaexpropriation of african land over percent of the total land area being reserved for current and future european use rigid separation of the races territorially socially etc imposition of the most oppressive and humiliating codes of law on the african majority including pass laws curfew regulations in urban areas constant police surveillance and harassment the denial of meaningful political rights to africans has been the central tenet of settler rule and this has never been seriously questioned even by the most liberal settler politicians thus africans have been denied the vote through the imposition of various qualifications which are carefully and cynically trimmed to include all whites and to exclude all but a token number of blacks open political organization among africans has virtually been proscribed on a permanent basis between and five major african political parties were banned and hundreds of their leaders and followers placed in jail and concentration camps without trial and in most cases for indefinite periods it may be noted here that throughout this period britain as the imperial power with overall responsibility for the destiny of the colony never once lifted a finger against the perpetration of these outrages by her immigrant nationals indeed successive british governments extended greater powers to the settlers whenever the latter sought to broaden their stranglehold on the country thus for example in rhodesia was granted socalled responsible selfgovernment in she was allowed to pass the iniquitous land apportionment act which is the sheetanchor of the racist structure of the country in rhodesian settlers conspired with those in the then northern rhodesia now zambia and the then nyasaland now malawi to concoct the central african federation despite african opposition in britain in league with the settlers imposed a thoroughly undemocratic constitution on rhodesia in spite of vehement african opposition to the scheme and when the un at the initiative of ghana tried in to pass a resolution barring rhodesia from acquiring the military equipment of the defunct central african federation britain vetoed that particular resolution it is unnecessary to illustrate further the accuracy and validity of our original contention that rhodesia developed as a miniature south africa and that she was aided and abetted in this process by the same british government which today pretends quite hypocritically to be leading the sanctions war against that country the extent of south african involvement has not of course been limited to the general politicoideological influences of the sort we have alluded to since the illegal declaration of independence by the ian smith regime south africa has moved in to stabilize and bolster the rhodesian economy trade between the two countries has increased phenomenally rhodesia has been offered convenient credit facilities for the purchase inor through south africa of essential commodities and weapons of war for the suppression of the african liberation forces inside rhodesia south africa has facilitated the process whereby rhodesia has been able to continue trading with the rest of the world by the device of setting up dummy companies in south africa which then channel goods to and from rhodesia the point about all this is that south africa has a vital interest in the situation in rhodesia she obviously calculates that the fall of rhodesia would bring the forces of african liberation to her own doorsteps and will therefore fight to prevent this eventuality above all south africa realizes that the fall of a regime founded on the same racist principles as herself would have a profound moral and psychological effect on south africa conversely the endurance of the rhodesian regime can be expected to bolster the morale of the south african racists and to ensure the security of south africas northern frontiers these considerations have therefore impelled south africa to actively support the rhodesia settler dictatorship economically diplomatically and militarily elements of the south african army air force and police force are presently serving in rhodesia against zimbabwe guerrilla forces taking these factors into account to suppose that south africa might abandon rhodesia would be laughable were it not also a tragic form of selfdeception south africa cannot now nor ever will abandon rhodesia unless the military costs to her become excessively unbearable our analysis thus points to the inescapable conclusion that un sanctions against rhodesia can only have at the very most an extremely peripheral effect on the total situation the sanctions could conceivably produce a dent on the props of the rhodesian economy were they also to be applied against south africa which country after all at the very minimum richly deserves that treatment but it would be naive even to dream that the un could take action of a radical nature against south africa after all that countrys best friends the usa britain and france are blessed with oermanent seats a on the un security council just to ensure no gaps are left unplugged despite these and other western countries eloquent and colorful oratory denouncing apartheid we can expect their active involvement in the gilded muck of the south african situation to con ft tinue or even to grow apace the most we can expect of collective international action against the modern hitlers of south africa are lots of wordy resolutions liberally larded with gratuitous free world advice cautioning against precipitous and irresponsible action against the criminal perpetrators of apartheid this type of preachy and condescending paternalism has almost become routine at the un it becomes clear from the foregoing that the vote of the house of lords in support of ian smith referred to at the start of this article cannot be treated as the impulsive act of a few oldfashioned british imperialist peers that vote represented widelylaid sympathies for rhodesia among virtually all significant sectors of british public opinion including the governing labor party itself the only real difference between mr wilson and his baronial opponents is that the latter have tactlessly and needlessly exposed britain instead of sensibly coating the pill of anglorhodesian collusion with the sugar of all the sweet talk about fairplay etc the position adopted by the british lords after all been given open and nearfanatical expression to by no less a personage than former u s secretary of state dean acheson see washington post dec as an example acheson cloaks his support for the rhodesian settlers in pseudolegalistic terms arguing with ridiculous abandon that to impose sanctions against rhodesia is a contravention of the un charter on the basis of this puerile legalistic nonsense acheson evidently hopes to have the u s openly recognize and support the rhodesian settler dictatorship thus far from lacking friends abroad rhodesia probably has a surfeit of these at all levels we are not even including such groups as the birchites etc in view of the foregoing factors it would have been suicidal for zimbabwe africans to have placed any hopes on the un to help their liberation every indication points to the inescapable fact that the initiative and responsibility for effecting that liberation must lie with the zimbabweans themselves while they may receive support from abroad such support can only be complimentary to their own efforts this is not to decry outside help by any means for such help is certainly needed in view of the formidable forces against which zimbabwe freedom fighters are ranged but external support cannot constitute the decisive element here no doubt zimbabweans will triumph over their internationallysupported oppressors when the hour of reckoning arrives however we shall all be the wiser for having travelled through the current difficulties and thus being enabled to see who were our true friends and who our bitter enemies that lesson cannot be lost upon the present generation of zimbabweans she lit a candle one man in his time plays many parts shakespeare wrote but not many women have assumed and carried off many parts with such vibrancy and fortitude as has ida l jackson even in her native vicksburg mississippi miss jacksons eyes were always on the goal that if she had the best in education herself she could better educate others there she attended rust college and new orleans college now dillard university when the family moved to oakland california she enrolled at the university of california at berkeley and obtained her ab degree ma degree and her administrative credentials she became the first black woman to teach in a public high school ida l jackson in california imperial valley and was the first black teacher in the oakland california public school systemand the only one for years she organized the first black sorority on the pacific coast rho chapter at the university of california in miss jackson attended a choir concert composed of young singers from the cotton fields of mississippi the lecturer accompanying them described the abject poverty and squalor of the black tenant farmers life in rural mississipp not only were there few educational opportunities but unending poverty with its accompanying ramshackle housing containing neither plumbing nor lights and a plantation system that bordered on serfdom had left the people dehumanized and defeated hearing of these bleak and grim conditions rekindled an idea miss jackson had long held that educated professional black people should take the initiative in helping the less fortunate of the race if they were to be reached at all she felt the wav to better conditions at that time was to conduct a summer school for rural black teachers illiterate adults and children endowed with the noblest of all emotionsenthusiasm and dripping with go she immediately sought help from others of like mind and using her own funds she scheduled the first summer school for six weeks in at the school in lexington mississippi for which the cotton field singers had been concertizing to raise funds however before the six weeks were over it was evident that the overwhelming need was for health care and health education in lexington and the surrounding rural country disease and poverty were rampant among families whose median income was a year some of the teachers and pupils attending the summer school would get up at am to work in the fields before walking three seven and eight miles to school but those not suffering from contagious diseases pellagra syphilis were nutritionally starved from an unbroken diet of the msmeat meal and molasses the nittygritty need wasnt education but immediate health care more convinced than ever that the educated and trained black individual had a responsibility to take the lead in alleviating the grinding poverty of the less fortunate and having become national president of her sorority alpha kappa alpha she proposed to her sorors the idea of a health clinic at lexington after initiating and completing plans for this and after persuading the membership to vote the funds she found doctors to participate and interested other members in voluntarily helping during their summer vacations the plans to set up a permanent health clinic at lexington immediately ran into a period of sturm und drang from white plantation owners always fearful of outside agitators they would not allow the blacks to leave the plantations to attend the clinic it became necessary to reorganize the clinic and to take the services to the plantations and carry on under the watchful eyes of the overseers this innovation was a firsttime use of mobile health clinics and it proved to be best for this first year as more people were reached in isolated areas who would not have been able to come to a central clinic even with the consent of the plantation boss most of the blacks had never had any medical attention and eagerly attended the clinics many had never seen a black woman doctor or dentist and they felt proud that their own race was trying to help them for eight summers doctors nurses teachers and dentists from the sorority membership volunteered each summer to take health services to areas not previously visited over these years children were immunized against diphtheria and smallpox thousands of adults were treated for malaria syphilis and dental needs each child received a new toothbrush and instructions in its use expectant mothers and children with rickets were provided with protective food concentrates a trailer kitchen was added to educate the sharecropper families to plant kitchen gardens to vary their m diets in the first summer of operation the mobile caravan covered over miles leaving behind less misery illness relief and hope the earlier attitude of hostility from plantation owners changed to one of cooperation and welcome the second summer the clinic was shifted to bolivar county distinguished at that time by the fact that no insurance company would issue policies to its residents because of the poor health conditions and the high sickness rate the white health officer of the county welcomed the clinic and helped the sorority to establish a permanent base at the allblack town of mound bayou he also helped to advertise the clinic by having circulars printed contacting plantation owners and ministers and posting notices at one twoday session over patients attended the results in bolivar county where the population was almost threequarters black was that the residents became healthconscious and the clinics were crowded a black fraternal order which was planning to build an office building in mound bayou changed its plans and built a modern bcd hospital the first and only one for blacks in the county at the end of each summer session of the clinic the county continued the malaria and syphilis treatments with drugs donatcu by the sorority as a demonstration project the purpose of which was to arouse official agencies to the pressing need for medical services and their responsibility for providing equal care for all groups the late dr thomas parran former surgeongeneral of the united states called the eightyear project one of the best jobs of volunteer public health work i have ever seen the work of the alpha kappa alpha health project attracted the attention of the late president franklin d roosevelt and miss jackson was invited to be his guest at the nations christmas tree lighting ceremony as founder and general director of the project miss jackson received an invitation from mrs roosevelt to attend along with the clinics medical director a conference at the white house to discuss operation of the clinics and other health problems mrs roosevelt became an honorary member of the sorority miss jackson was granted a leave of absence from the oakland school department to work towards a doctorate at columbia university and later to serve as dean of women at tuskegee institute alabama while at tuskegee she became an admiring friend of the late dr george washington carver who called her his inspiration also during her time at tuskegee she represented the university of california at berkeley at the inauguration ceremonies for a new president at dillard university she assisted the late dr mary mcleod bethune in the organization of the national council of negro women of which she is a life member and she was appointed an observer to the united nations organization meeting in san francisco in she is a life member too of the national education association and the national association for the advancement of colored people miss jackson was listed in whos who in colored america in and whos who on the pacific coast edition in she was voted one of the most outstanding women in america of the many outstanding roles miss jackson has playedshe remains always the teacher the ida l jackson library at the junior college in mississippi is named in her honor she makes cases of solicited books available to saints school in lexington even carrying loads there in her car she has served as a lecturer in human relations at stanford university and at mills college and her influence has been felt many times in oakland she has served as a director of the family service bureau the mayors committee on civic unity the urban league and as a volunteer in the oakland health departments night tb clinics during negro history week in the east bay negro historical society gave her a certificate of award for contributions to education and humanitarianism imbued with the idea that one of the enduring realities in life is service what is important to her is what she can contribute to others to miss jackson one has contributed if one can make something better and less barren for a deprived underprivileged life and if one can make other people think of doing the same resigning from her teaching and counseling position at mcclymonds high school because of business obligations at her ranch in mendocino county she has transferred her active concern for community betterment to this northern california area she would like to reserve part of her lookout ranch as a resort or camp for girl and boy scouts everythings in other hands lucilius time alone is ours ida l jackson is possessed of an excellent education which prepared her for freedom inseparable from responsibility and her high standards have guided her in using her time to make the world a better place in which to liveby example the thick whipping by louise m meriwether et me the razor strop francie i it dont whip m e mother get me that strop i went into the bathroom and took daddys razor strop off the rusty nail and walked back into the dining room and handed it to mother her light brown face plump like the rest of her was quivering with anger i had already started to whimper i only asked him for a nickel mother and it wasnt like asking a stranger the bastard had ratted on me my own uncle he was the only colored man we knew in harlem who had a steady job and daddy was always saying how lucky his brotherinlaw was cause the depression was so bad even the ofays couldnt find jobs leastways a negro it was and almost everybody was on relief including us uncle hiram was so stingy though that he never offered you a cent so i put it on his mind and asked him for a nickel and he squealed to mother soons she came home from her daywork in the bronx mother advanced on me and i saw with horror how she was holding that strop you aint gonna beat me with the thick end i couldnt believe it and i knocked down a chair getting out of her way mother kept on coming in all of my years i had never before been beaten with the thick end not because i was all that good but because i was a girl and daddys pet you got whipped with the thick end of the strop when you did something real bad otherwise you got a lick or two with the thin end daddy was always whipping on my brothers butts with that thick end especially james junior who had joined the ebony dukes and was running wild daddy said james junior was gonna disgrace us all sterling quiet and moody didnt get whipped much any more i aint gonna chase you all over this room mother said and she snatched me and dragged me into her bedroom and flung me down on the bed i was too longlegged to be put across her lap so she sort of kneeled on my back and pulled down my bloomers with one hand raising the strop with the other i told you before and i aint gonna tell you again you dont beg nobody for nothing each word was punctuated with a lash on my bare behind and i screamed so loud that mothers words got lost but i got the message when she was through mother went into the kitchen to wash some clothes while i sat there on her bed whimpering thinking my dinner hadnt been worth this whipping i had asked uncle hiram for that nickel so i could eat at father divines not that there wasnt something to eat at home mother always saw to that even if it was nothing but that gold can jive we got from the relief place which nobody in harlem would eat no matter how it was doctored up with onions and tomato paste the yellow label said it was canned beef but the rumor was it was horsemeat so we called it the gold can jive and it was weighing down the shelves in everybodys cupboards they also gave out butter and dried prunes at the relief place and our social worker who we called madame queen cause she was so snobbish acted like it was her instead of president roosevelt who was giving us the relief money and all that stuff daddy hadnt wanted to go on relief in the first place but mother kept complaining we was starving on the few bucks he made collecting numbers for frenchy a creole who ran a candy store on fifth avenue as a front for his policy business daddy finally agreed that mother could do housework for three days a week if she would just stop bugging him but a month later still complaining mother also applied for relief daddy hollered and cursed something awful but mother told him his pride wouldnt feed us and that was that anyway after uncle hiram gave me the nickel i had cents and i walked up to th street to father divines place because i hated the greasy collard greens and fat back we had at home and i wanted one of fathers cents chicken dinners peace its wonderful father divines place was a storefront i paid my cents at the door and found a seat at the round table in the middle of the room fathers followers and other people like me who were just plain hungry were jammed tight around that table gulping down their food with no side talk whatever one of fathers angels a huge black woman dressed in a bed sheet her hair nappier than the day she was bom brought me a plate of golden brown chicken from the kitchen she nodded at the bread and vegetables on the table meaning for me to help myself instead of grace you had to praise fathers holy name so i turned to the man next to me and said father divine is god would you please pass me that plate of blackeye peas when i finished eating i walked back home skirting mount morris park i liked the food at father divinesyou got more than you could eat for fifteen centsbut i always had to go alone none of my friends would come with me not even becky they were ashamed of those nappyheaded angels who wouldnt straighten their hair and wore white robes and changed their names to beloved theresa or sweet morning glory when they entered fathers kingdom i sat on mothers bed sulking about my whipping for about twenty minutes until mother called me to go to the store i walked into the kitchen its walls greasestained and peeling and mother handed me a list of things to buy and the credit book i hated to go to mr wellmans the grocer but seeing as how i just had gotten my butt whipped i didnt dare say a thing so i went on downstairs becky was sitting on my stoop i dont have to go to mr wellmans no more she said i told my mother this morning i just wasnt going did she slap you up side your head i asked no she sent nancy instead becky was almost and had those pretty west indian eyes with lights flashing in them nancy was her younger sister as i crossed fifth avenue dragging my feet to postpone the agony i wished i had a younger sister to send to the store i didnt mind mr wellman so muchhe was a nice roly poly west indianbut it was his wife and their snotty little girl yolanda that got next to me our relief money never got any further than mr wellmans and daddy said wed never get out of the hole that way after we paid mr wellman what we owed him we were broke so we started buying things on credit again the next day and his fat slob wife never failed to look at you crosseyed after you ordered all those bags of groceries and then held out the credit book instead of money i opened the door to the store and mourned my bad luck mrs wellman was behind the counter and yolanda ten plump and lightskinned like her mother with two black braids hanging to her shoulders was perched on a high stool next to the rice sack hello mrs wellman hello yolanda they both grunted at me ten cents worth of dried herrings i said its cents a pound mrs wellman stared at me my mother only wants ten cents worth my voice sank lower she threw the herrings on the scale and snatched them off before i could see how much she had given me i read the rest of the items off the list and watched as mrs wellman wrote the prices down on a large paper bag and added them up that will be two dollars and ten cents i held out the credit book mrs wellman stared at it like she had never seen it before which was silly she saw it almost every day when do you all get your relief money she asked the first of the month mrs wellman she knew it was the first she knew it she knew it finally she took the book and mumbling under her breath wrote the figure in it stuffed the groceries into the bag and shoved them over the counter towards me as i walked out the door yolandas eyes burned a hole in my back she never played with the rest of us and i dont know why me and becky let her upset us so after all she was only but she sat there on that stool silent and snotty making me feel that it wasnt only her store but her world and i had no place in it nobody goes to bed early in harlem in the summer cause its too hot to sleep so although it was close to midnight me and mother were still up she had finished washing and was sitting in her room figuring out the number for tomorrow daddy had taught her his system i was sitting at the dining room table reading a library book armed with my usual supply of weapons tonight i had a hammer a screwdriver and two hairbrushes when i heard a noise i threw the hammer towards the kitchen and the rats scurried back into their holes i was scared peeless by those rats they had already bitten everybody except me and mother and had run a cat we once had clean out of his mindchased him right into the living room wall i bet that cat kept on running until he got to brooklyn those rats grew fat on the rat poison mother was always putting down on raw potato slices and they thrived on the sulphur bombs mother was always gassing us with when i got down to my last weapon i would give up the dining room to them and go on to bed i couldnt keep my mind on my book though cause i was worried about my brothers wondering where they were so late and hoping they would beat daddy home so he wouldnt whip their behinds again i had just thrown the screwdriver down the hall when there was a sudden banging on the dining room door sudden noises scared me they usually meant something terrible had happened so i just sat there with my heart pounding not making a move whats the matter with you francie mother grumbled as she went to the door cant you hear all that banging you act more like an idiot each day it was true i was getting scared of everything it was mrs maceo our nextdoorneighbor breathing hard from her climb up to the top floor mr coffin home she asked lord they done stabbed mr edwards who done stabbed him mother asked i don know he laying down there in the hallway with an ice pick in his chest mother told mrs maceo that daddy wasnt home and they ran down the stairs with me trailing behind them the hallway was full of kids and there was papa dan mrs maceos husband stone drunk and drooling as usual the naked bulb hanging from the ceiling threw tall shadows on the wall and cast a halo around mr edwards our janitor lying so bloody and still at the foot of the stairs daddy came through the vestibule door and knelt beside him you kids go on back outside he ordered they retreated as far as the doorway jessie run across the street to the drugstore and call the ambulance mother rushed outside a crowd had gathered on the stoop and i searched their faces until i found my brothers they were there thank god james junior had daddys dark good looks while me and sterling were plain like mother daddy said though that i was pretty but both me and mother agreed he had strange ideas on the subject often claiming some thicklipped gal was a black beauty i was skinny and rusty and looked a mess i knew and couldnt understand it when people said i looked just like daddy james junior pushed his way through the crowd and came to me you all right francie i nodded james junior was sweet like that old moody sterling didnt even look in my direction just kept frowning and staring at the blood on mr edwards chest the police arrived first then the whitecoated ambulance doctors and suddenly all that was left of our janitor was a red stain on the dirty tile floor i had lived in harlem all of my life and should have been used to stabbings and shootings and sudden death especially in the summertime when the heat seemed to spur everybody to violence but i wasnt used to it and that night when i closed my eyes all i could see was mr edwards lying in that hallway so still so still he died the next day in harlem hospital it was rumored he had hit the number for a dollar with a runner from uptown who swore mr edwards hadnt put the number in that day mr edwards raved he would kill the sonofabitch and it was thought he just had got done in first but the police never did arrest that runner niggers killing niggers dont interest these cops daddy mumbled to mother a few days later mother didnt say anything but my eyes met hers and i saw fear in themfear that it could have been daddy lying in that bloody hallway and i realized for the first time that i wasnt the only one in that house whose heart was always beating like a drum our jewish landlord who lived in white plains offered daddy the janitors job and it became our lot to pull the garbage mop down the stairs and keep the backyard clean which was none too easy because it was simpler to throw garbage out of the window into the yard than to wait until six oclock when the garbage was pulled that dumbwaiter was a filthy slimy mess a permanent home for cockroaches and rats and i would just as soon open the window myself and sling the garbage out than open that dumbwaiter door daddy got up at five oclock in the morning to start the furnace in the basement before somebody started banging on the pipes for hot water but he made junior and sterling bank the fire at night and that kept them a little closer to home it was on account of that janitors job that madame queen cut us off relief daddy didnt get any pay for being the janitor just a reduction in rent and he didnt tell madame queen this right away so when she found out she cut us off daddy told her hed planned to tell her in about a month by the time he could break even with mr wellman but she didnt believe him as good as called daddy a liar mother said she would help out by doing three more days a week for her white ladys sister they dont give you enough money to live on daddy raved at mother so either you have to bootleg some kind of work or hit the number or rob somebody so your kids wont starve and anything you do is against the law damn bastards didnt i tell you in the first place i wanted nothing to do with these social workers but daddy didnt say mother couldnt work three more days so she did just that and was gone every day now except sunday now that mother was away so much we didnt eat dinner together any more my brothers came home at different times and ate in the kitchen daddy would put on some mustard greens and when i came home from school i would turn them off and cook a pot of rice daddy was a geechie so we had rice every day me and that rice it was either scorched or a soggy mess once daddy looked at it with disgust that day it was soggy why in hell dont you teach this girl to cook a decent pot of rice he roared at mother my feelings were hurt mother didnt bother to answer her silence saying louder than words that he was home all day so why didnt he teach me himself you a moron or something he turned on me that you cant cook a decent pot of rice my tears were instant i measure it out just like you do daddy only it gets dry while its still raw so i add more water the gas the gas daddy yelled he was always yelling these days youve got the damn gas turned up too high you dont boil rice you steam it the sight of my tears didnt make him turn gentle as it usually did he finished eating and banged out of the house mumbling that it was a goddamn shame a man couldnt get a decent pot of rice in his own house i felt bad for hours cause daddy seldom hollered at me but after that i didnt cook any more soggy pots of rice it was summer and we had been off relief for two months when mother finally hauled me down to the relief office with her things were so tight we were eating that gold can jive and i swear it was horsemeat it was that stringy mrs maceo told mother she ought to go on down to the relief office and pitch a bitch that was the only way to get anything mrs maceo said she put some soap in her mouth and went to that office foaming like a mad dog and didnt leave until they gave her a clothing allowance for her daughter mother told mrs maceo she would do likewise but i knew mother wasnt about to pitch no fit the relief place was across the street from mount morris park and all we did was sit around that office all day long seeing one supervisor then waiting years to see the supervisors supervisor what a system we had been there since nine oclock and had seen four people and it was almost three now mother was sitting at the desk of our fifth interviewer and i was standing by her side this one whose bumpy thin face was screwed into a frown like she was smelling piss all day long was the head flunky i hoped she preached at mother like she was a thief for trying to get even so all our checks wouldnt have to go to mr wellman we had sinned she made that clear they all did if daddy hadnt reported his janitors job why hadnt mother ratted on him it was her duty to her children to be truthful and godfearing did mother realize she had violated section g of the relief code mother was apologetic she didnt report that she too was bootlegging domestic work or they would have deducted money for that also she hung her head guilty and spoke softly she would never violate the rules again the lord knew but her children were hungry please forgive us our sins this one time and give us our daily bread and another supply of dried prunes and butter and that gold can crap i sat there looking like a ragpicker in my scuffed sneakers and patched skirt one of mothers hungry children wideeyed and innocent go screw yourself i said silently to the pimply face who was humbling my mother i was too mad to cry i would have yelled out loud or hit the woman who suddenly looked like madame queen they all did were it not for the look on my mothers face where had i seen that look before at whose funeral and i knew suddenly by the pain in my mothers eyes that she was beating herself with the thick end of the razor strap thats how we got back on relief the next week the checks started again and we were soon back in hock to mr wellman daddy never did ask mother how she got us back on and mother never did tell him had he known he would have disowned us both few problems and set limited as well as long range goals it becomes difficult to see progress to experience success and to feel a sense of accomplishment it is important for black groups to define their problems and the purpose of the group clearly to set out specific short and long range goals and to decide how they will measure success and determine progress this will ease much of the psychological frustration which builds up and becomes a depressive discouraging and divisive factor in the experiences of an organization related to this goal definition is an often found stumbling block in black groups which we will call the inability to set limits due in part to the need to speak up and to release rage and due in part to their lack of an agenda and a program much time in meetings of some black groups is spent testifying that is members very often stand up to testify to their dedication and acceptability as black militants they will display militant credentials and try to outblack each other they may harangue against honkies proclaim what they are going to do and put down other people as being uncle toms and handkerchief heads in essence they assume a blacker than thou attitude the problem with this behavior is that it becomes an end in itself in addition it tends to place a premium on militancy and personal qualities which soon become so exclusive that no one is black enough or down enough to be acceptable this all then becomes selfdefeating since members try to outdo each other and in the process exclude most of the group members on the other hand if goals were established it would be easier for group members to determine the acceptability of other members that is if the purpose of the group was to solicit money it would not be harmful for members to have white persons as friends in fact this could be advantageous however to take an extreme example if the purpose of the group was to arm itself for armed combat against whites it would be unrealistic to expect a black person married to a white person to participate wholeheartedly on the basis of the purpose and program of an organization therefore criteria could be more easily and less arbitrarily established what very often happens in these groups is that people are excluded on the basis of others feelings about who should be in and who should be out two more phenomena often seen in the meetings and behavior of black organizations prevent them from functioning effectively the first is the concentration on terminology and namecalling and the second is the severe negativism of certain group members an inordinate amount of meeting time is often spent arguing over terminology black groups will debate whether to use the term negro afroamerican or black and forget the major problems at hand this propensity to get sidetracked by peripheral issues happens too often in the life of black organizations for them not to recognize this as a destructive tendency when the discussions are over and the smoke clears the enemy is still white racism and all energies should be directed towards eliminating this discussions in black groups many times get bogged down and sidetracted by namecalling instead of recognizing differences among members but valuing the common cause individuals will begin to call some people uncle toms bourgeois or bourgies conservatives footshufflers black caucasians and a variety of other uncomplimentary names the members seem to lose sight of their common black identity and to see divisions and differences rather than similarities and group needs whether we approve or not there is a growing sense of black unity and solidarity as more and more afroamericans come to feel that their survival depends more upon group strength than upon individual strength presently many of these new groups are hampered by psychological difficulties much of which stems from the effects on blacks of a white racist heritage with time these newlyformed black groups will grow in effectiveness and have a potential to contribute a great deal to the progress of amity among americans mayfield i dont want to go around mouthing all that gossip about the extraliterary activities of harlem writers guild which leaped across into puerto rico and havana and then to our ancestral pads in accra i love my black writers especially if they are black all i aims to see em do man is to excel and make it but damn mayfield here you are sittin on all that fantastical experience about black writers in love and also exile with your poor readers thirsting for knowledge literary exaltation and a bit of honest healthy sensuous titillation come on now julian m bare your soul and tell all be a real literary adventurer a black lover with soul syntax an eagle eye for truth plus the right political line in your heart even if poor kwame nkrumah did goof give us the livin lowdown on what went down in ghana your readership will applaud posterity will enshrine you in literary sainthood and ill swear youll never have to make another movie as long as you live unless its from your new book the milk train doesnt stop in accra anymore the negro digest readership will not of course have any inkling at all of what i am here alluding to but it is to be understood that i am not of a mind to be spreading gossip as it came to me i would rather have mayfield supply the real truth about ghana and why he split accra for spain which used to own puerto rico julian was so involved in telling the readers about his conversations with intellectual royalty web du bois in ghana that i was licking my chops with anticipation i thought he might be leading up to some inside gossip pardon that word about kwame nkrumahs egyptian love who i am told was sent to nkrumah by nasser beautifully wrapped whatever happened to her also what happened to the first mrs nkrumah perhaps julian m is politically coy out of respect for kwames downfall well i can appreciate such sentiments i too loved kwame despite his goof but really julian m had open access to nkrumahs castle and the open sesame to a whole lot of official secrets the reader should understand that i am not at all interested in spreading gossip about the political and amorous misadventures of our black literary lions i am simply one who feels that there are very often close connections between love and politics which some black writers ought to explore in search of new themes after all john oliver killens julian mayfield and others conducted a workshop where i assume the problem of themes in black must have been debated at some length so after consideration of the fact that julian m hasnt published a novel in several years and after reading that disastrous last book of killens called sippi i have to wonder why is it that both killens and mayfield both allowed all that good luscious truelife material out of the harlem writers guilds early days to go completely to waste if mayfield refuses for good reasons to play the black henry miller then killens ought to step forth and rescue the black novel from the limbo of the protest civilwritism of the denatured black soul and tell it like it is or like it was indemdays but get thismayfield says to me there is nothing in the life which has been honestly lived that should be ignored if history happens to take any account of you if a man like du bois could confess that he was wrong then certainly people like cruse and myself ought to have the guts to admit to murder and rape man now that allusion to rape was a freudian slip if ever heard one because i am told that in the harlem writers guild well enough i await julian mayfield to follow his own advice on that score and write now again back to our cuban adventure mayfield in exposing my terrible unrevolutionary conduct managed to forget to mention the conduct of his colleague sarah wright who embarrassed us all by returning from the cuban hills to the hotel presidente about nine oclock in the morning and demanding that the waiters bring her a rum daiquiri from the hotel bar which was not in the habit of opening until late in the afternoon our social and political stock sure took a deep dip that day in havana when our cuban hosts heard about that miss wright didnt simply ask she was arrogant about it then there was the case of sarah wrights husband passing spot judgments on cuban race relations as a white man he did not even belong in our delegation because castro had asked for a contingent of black writers however in the leftwing whites are allowed to do as they please in black affairs and i didnt hear mayfield complaining then there was the case of the writer whose name i wont mention who demanded that the cuban government pay the hotel for a bottle of liquor he ordered that was the first of a series of unrevolutionary examples of bad conduct which occurred before i cried for water in the hills i could tell more but i dont like too much gossip mayfields problem is that he never fully understood the movement he was only marginally a part of he came into the harlem movement from his broadway role in lost in the stars and touched the harlem party only as far as its cultural fringes thus he functioned in the privileged and exclusive segment of the party the other side which he purports to tell about he doesnt really know it seems that nobody but mayfield is vague about who and what was the harlem writers club in its conflict with communist party headquarters in harlem i think i made this explicit enough but not enough for mayfield this is because mayfield does not know that in black nationalism was not a trend in the communist party at all however any black party member who challenged the role of whites in the harlem party structure was immediately labeled a bourgeois antiwhite nationalist that is what i was called but black nationalist and black nationalism were not in our vocabulary at that time what mayfield is really complaining about is that i didnt tell enough about me personally it was however not my intentions to write an autobiography about my exploits in the party that is another kind of a book if i had written an autobiography of my marxist career it would have necessitated indulging in the same kind of gossip that mayfield indulges in in his challenge and it is good thing i didnt he is so unknowledgeable about the harlem party affairs that he makes this statement in he cruse was upandcoming marxist theoretician not a black nationalist and not a mere rankandfiler like the rest of us i can remember how we youngsters looked up to him because he functioned on a policymaking level speaking from a background of such authority cruse could no doubt tell us more than he has in his book and the average reader would understand how he came to know so much as we have already decided i hope not prematurely that cruse is not bucking for a job in washington my only conclusion is that he wants to be sure he is in step with the younger militants by establishing a background that he has always been antiwhite and antiintegrationist this statement is laughable and infantile because i was never on a policymaking level and mayfield was never any rankandfiler i was the chairman of the harlem writers club which was the pioneer black communist writers group established in harlem after the war mayfield obviously never knew what constituted the policymaking level in harlem or what actually went on there it was those communist leaders on the harlem policy making level who did not want the harlem writers club to exist at all this writers club was harassed by the leadership in harlem from its very inception to the time it disbanded this was what further embittered me the chairman against the harlem leadership how could i be thrust into a position of clashing with the harlem leadership as the chairman of a writers club and at the same time be a functioning part of the harlem policymaking level on page of my book i explicitly describe the clash between the writers club and the harlem leadership on page i write our ideas on the matter of integration were not too clearcut or definitive we were certainly not against integration of the negro in the arts but at the time it struck us that since negroes had no flourishing ethnic arts institutions pursuing this integration theme was like launching a campaign with no thought of building a starting base this was the attitude that i and others had about integration which was definitely a farcry from black nationalism it would certainly be asking mayfield too much to read my book carefully because he has clearly stated he doesnt like the book that is his privilege because it wasnt written for mayfield and his friends to like contrary to him i have never tried to make the younger generation believe that i was always antiwhite or antiintegration i was neither until my experiences in the communist party made me critical of whites as assumed leaders of blacks and progressively doubtful of many of the claims for racial integration eighteen years after his broad way debut mayfield is still lost in the stars concerning the political and cultural implications of the communist leftwing this is because he was never a true rankandfiler who had to struggle his way up from the ranks as an unknown he came into the harlem movement with the prestige of a broadway role in a hit musical play and functioned as a minor celebrity with all the privileges which that entailed for a negro actor in this was a signal achievement and mayfield in still views the political and cultural scene from that remembered vantage point it is very natural for him to leap to the defense of his cultural and political trend of thinking writing etc for i am critically attacking a political and cultural trend even though my method and tone takes on a somewhat personal character however julian mayfield should remember that the communists themselves are the most practiced masters of this type of cultural and political polemic they inflicted it on me for a spell on several occasions and i waited a long time for the day when i would be able to return the critical thrust on the same terms and i repeat it was not meant to be liked or agreed with by mayfield or anyone else i would also advise julian mayfield that it is to my credit that i kept the personal animus down to its barest minimum by keeping myself out of the critique as much as possible what i personally did or didnt do is not of much importance in however what is important is what i saw understood and objectively experienced it was my duty and responsibility as a social critic to put it down on paper for posterity finally the basic deficiency in julian mayfields defensive challenge to my book in which little or nothing was challenged but my right to write it is one that has its roots in the crisis of the black intellectual which is my theme these black intellectuals of our generation born between the two great wars simply dont know anything and seldom even think it important to find out anything beyond what might be necessary to get a college degree in this regard mayfield ponders the question of how i came to know so much oh julian thou doth my ego proud that thou doth deign to marvel at my historical eruditionor man you know that cat mustve sho been diggin into them history tomes cause he is so historically hep he is outa sight no julian not only am i a communist party dropout who never got to be a leader on a policymaking level as you assert i was also a high school dropout and delinquent who later reformed upon discovering that if one wanted to know anything one had to read later on i learned that if one wanted to read properly one had also to learn research so i became a researcher research clarifies many questions that exist clothed in vague ambiguities like too many of our black creative intellectuals julian mayfield shows that he is not a researcher which renders him a poor analyst this intellectual deficiency causes him to miss the implications of much of my bookfor example my preoccupation with the career of claude mckay and his communist connections claude mckay himself was critical of people and their communist connections for me to review the times of claude mckay and his contemporaries in the light of their communist connections is not the same thing as putting them on a crap list but represents an attempt at an historical method of literary and social criticism the fact that mayfield persists in thinking this way indicates that in his chosen disciplinethe novelhe can hardly be expected to rise above the ordinary because novelwriting on a higher level is also a form of social criticism but then one has to remember that mayfield is also an actor of some note and i think the acting impulse is strongest with him many black actors have difficulty in drawing the proper line between social reality and the world behind the footlights anguish by addison gayle jr e just wanted to march to show our respect said renee thats all we didnt want no violence we just wanted to march because he was a great leader she would remember this day april as the longest of her life earlier she had attended a rally called to protest the racist slurs of a professor at city college she had implored her fellow students to besiege the members of the state legislature with letters in an attempt to save seeka college program for young students from the ghetto what that professor said about us you know it really dont count i mean he aint that important but them legislators up there in albany if they dont appropriate some money for this program well you know like we in trouble she had remained at the college after classes to ask nonseek students to join in her protest much later she had attended a concert of africanamerican dance and music here she heard the announcement the girl on the stage stopped dancing and she mumbled something but she had such a thick accent you know that we couldnt understand her then somebody ran into the auditorium and told us that dr_king was dead i didnt believe it no i still dont they left the auditorium in the middle of the concert joining hands with almost other students black and white renee marched down convent avenue to th street where a worried john lindsay pleaded with the students to halt we stopped said renee but other people they had followed us you know came along with us and then they started this the this was sporadic looting rock throwing and the hurling of crudelymade molotov cocktails two men their arms bulging with loot from a nearby mens store rushed past unseen by members of the tactical police force who stood fourabreast across the street from the baby grand night club as smoke darkened the sky in the vicinity of lenox avenue fire engines screamed past th street now barricaded by police vehicles en route to th street renee shook her head she was shocked and confused and a stare of disbelief prevailed in her young eyes now and then the revolving lights of the police vehicles accented the deep lines of her ovalshaped black face he didnt approve of violence she mumbled and it aint right to do this there was something pathetic in her words a sadness in her hurried statements a look of confusion in her oncebright eyes that told of the tragedy of the moment in a way that no statement from civil_rights leaders no pious declaration from public officials no in memoriam from gifted writers ever could martin_luther_king jr had not been her hero a child of the black_power revolution her heroes were stokely carmichael malcolm_x and leroi jones such men articulated her grievances in a way that dr_king had not true enough she could be momentarily swayed by his eloquence and was subject to moments of ecstasy in anticipation of actual contact with him yet his sonorous tones his calculated delivery of parethetical constructions his ofttimes thunderous miltonic inversions were the machinery of that evangelical past which she now disparaged hers was the world of camus of fanon of malraux and martin_luther_king jr seemed antithetical to all that that world symbolized so it was with most of her fellow students they stood together huddled in a small circle as if seeking protection from whatever danger manmade or otherwise lay concealed in the semidarkness of this frightful night they were young men and women for whom martin_luther_king jr had symbolized not the success of the future but instead the failure of the past previously they had denounced him in the most vitriolic terms quoted words from the autobiography of malcolm_x to refute his philosophy and spoken cynically though kindly of his proposed poor peoples march on washington only their elders had truly kept the faith they too came to the street comers some were drawn by the excitement generated by the events of the day others dazed benumbed sought solace in the company of those whose misery was akin to their own still others weaving between the groups of people made their way to the many churches in which harlem abounds yet they were united in one common endeavor the old and the young those who had kept the faith and those who had renounced all faith attempting to hold on to some small part of that vision which had been dr_kings most important asset the old had believed passionately fervently even to the point of idolizing the man who articulated the dream but the young had believed also their pressent militancy not withstanding the dream of martin luther king jr was more than the dream of their fathers and no matter the disclamees they spoke the postures they assumed the vehemence with which they rejected the american society the vision of an america free of prejudice intolerance and injustice was also theirs and now tonight on this most terrible of nigthts dr_kings importance was finally recognized the most sincere and eloquent spokesman of their cause was deadassassinated by a white man thats it for me a neatly dressed young man remarked in passing they do something like that to a man like king a man like king why one of the students asked her eyes red why him he didnt like no violence murmured renee almost incoherent and they killed him anyway she began to cry for the first time she could no longer not believe reality was too powerful once begun the tears a long time in coming rushed from her eyes as if propelled by a mechanical pump she stared at the top of a tenement building a few blocks away we just wanted to show our respect you know to show our respect because he was a great leader another student broke the circle of silence to echo her words yes a great leader she did not hear she stood buddhalike seeing and yet not seeing her eyes fixed upon the top of the building all too soon the long day had come to an end sorry to discomfort you chauncey warringham hildredth iii esq we know how distasteful it is for you to be reminded that most americans who resemble you are secondclass citizens we know you are the exception after all your parents were professional people who brought you up in a stable middleclass neighborhood you were integrated from elementary school through university and you are the only negro holding down a job like yours in a white firm yes we understand and we sincerely regret embarrassing you with all these demonstrations and freedom songs and sitins and boycotts we are sorry that because you look like us white people tend to lump you together with us however we ask you to endure the painful situation out of charity for those not so fortunate as you we recognize that this might not appeal to you especially but we feel that our concerted efforts to attain genuine freedom of opportunity and movement for all americans now are in the national interest ultimately we believe that a truly free america is an america of unsurpassable strength it is even possible that your children will be the immediate beneficiaries since they have a better education than most and are best qualified to accept the jobs which civil_rights pressures are opening up so have patience mr chauncey warringham hildredth iii the battle you are watching with such great aloofness sir is really your own
the fragmented movement by s e anderson ver since the first slaves the black liberation movement in america has embraced at least five different goals in the past the styles and rhetoric have been noticeably different for each goal today there are dangerous similarities in style and rhetoric between those who seek incorrect accommodationistwithdrawers goals and those who seek the correct revolutionary one at this prerevolutionary juncture it is imperative that black people be informed about our fragmented and stagnant movement what is attempted here is a contribution to black critical analysis of the five major factions within the black movement the integrationist historically the integrationist has incorrectly viewed the american institutions as racist by exception rather than by rule the integrationist believes in the deception of the american governmental structure having provisions for black redress of grievances he also believes that he actually can participate in the decisionmaking processes of his country and that because of a few racist and economic barriers black people have been denied their full firstclass share of the capitalistic goodies the integrationist believes that we have progressed through moral suasion via civil_rights legislation in most cases he accepts black culture as a somewhat lesser tributary culture of the white american cultural mainstream most integrationists do not see america as a powerful but degenerate world imperialist those integrationist who do see this feel that by injecting blackfolk into the existing american framework they will cool out the degeneracy it is clear they do not fathom the fact that when power corruptsit corrupts absolutely the integrationist believes in the minorityconcept that is america is at once a meltingpot and a pluralistic society this belief hides the most ram pant and fundamental problem racism it is extremely important to take note of the integrationists religious acceptance of capitalism being the best most humanistic politicoeconomic system to them all capitalism needs in order to fulfill the american dream is some black reform in the final analysis the integrationist suicidally depends upon white analysis and white assertions to determine his destiny he views selfdetermination as solving the bourgeois desires of materialism and immoralism to have the money to choose an el dorado over a continental to be able to determine without guilt which white bitch should have her racial myths fulfilled indeed the integrationists interests are selfish corrupt and diametrically opposed to the liberation of black people the citystatesman there are similarities between the integrationist and the citystatesman with regard to their reactionary attitude to every white american assertion one segment of the citystatesman group envisions the american politicoeconomic structure as legitimate and thus seeks to enter it by initially withdrawing and building the blackening cities into politically and economically powerful quasiautonomous citystates destined to vie for influence and control of white americas capital and resources the other segment believes that black cities can be simultaneously independently autonomous of the american doliticoeconomic structure and also exist within it as communal noncapitalist citystates what citystatesman cannot or refuse tosee is that white america will allow a pluralistic society only on its terms with respect to how it will be benefited yes white america will give up her cities to blacksand move all of its vital institutions industry communications banks airports etc into the suburbs the black citystates would be surrounded by white police and military forever on the edge of their triggers most of the citystates capital would be funnelled in through federal aid this would mean that the us government would have the first and last say about how and when to spend who should work and who should not many citystatesmen believe that these islands of black people surrounded by the sea of white america physically constitute a black nation they fail to realize that to have a nation is to have land control of human and natural resources and a culture defined and common among the people the nationalism of the citystatesman serves merely as an aid to white america in retaining black people as colonial subjects more precisely colonies have the facade of being independent if the colonized bourgeoisie are the administrators and civil servants the im mediate authority is loyalist black and the ultimate authority is the white colonizer witness the struggle for community control of the black schools the government will allow community control of the schoolsas long as they determine the framework philosophy hiring policies and the finances currently there are two different political proposals which are being discussed among the citystatesmen one is to politically deal through the democratic and republican parties as black blocs the other is to form a third political partysome say allblack others say a blackradicalwhite coalition party a la peace and freedom party the blacks who seek changes through these two proposals do not understand the following two things that one of the reasons why political parties become viable parties within the white american context is that they are founded upon racist assumptions and the limitations of black political parties having no alliance with the militaryindustrial complex for it is primarily because the democratic and republican parties are extension of the militaryindustrial complex that they are existing a black political party cannot align with any type of white political or economic institution unless it is a political party of suicidal blacks we must never forget that it is the nature of every white institutionbe it radical liberal or conservativeto be racist and therefore exploitive towards blackfolk back to africaism this sect splits itself into two fundamental factions a the brothers and sisters who want only to physically return to africa and b the brothers and sisters who want only to spiritually culturally and socially return to africa superficially to many the two ideas sound good but upon a deeper analysis we discover that they are not good ideas they are rather symptoms of withdrawal the afroamerican who wishes for a permanent mass migration of blackfolkor even a permanent migration of intellectuals and techniciansto africa is one who consciously or unconsciously affirms the myth of the invincible white man in most cases it is the intellectual rationalization of a brothers inability to struggle against oppressive forces hence some suggest that we return to africa and lead africa toward a colonialfree destiny how does the repatriatist know that our african brothers want us to lead them anywhere our african brothers are having enough hard times struggling against their internal and neocolonial contradictions to also have to cope with the psychocultural hangups of afroamericans this is to say that we do not abandon our communications military economic and cultural exchange between us rather it is to accentuate at this stage the necessity for twoway exchange of individuals rather than a oneway mass migration we cannot escape the racism and colonialism of america by running to africa because americas racism and colonialism are institutionalized everywhere moreover if most of our revolutionary forces were in africa we would be committing a cardinal sin withdrawing ones forces from the belly and brain of the enemv it should be made clear that this does not mean that brothers should not go over and join the african liberation armies it means those chosen afroamerican brothers who do so should not be only highly skilled in guerilla warfare but also skilled in some field relevant to the needs of the african country for which he is fighting on the other side of the backtoafrica mask we are confronted with the apolitical cultural nationalists they stress that if black people dug on the natural fact that black is beautiful then they would be liberated the apolitical cultural nationalists fail to check out the neocolonies of africa ghana nigeria senegal liberia kenya malawi etc in these countries blackfolk by and large still see blackness as beautifulbut it has not liberated them thev do not control their resources tneir capital or their politics witness all the military coups the africans culture is somewhat in tact and creative but without a political framework culture is not a liberatory force the root of the matter is that afroamerican apolitical cultural nationalists perceive blackness as necessary and sufficient when in reality blackness is necessary but not sufficient on the psychocultural level apolitical cultural nationalism is a reaction and withdrawal rather than an assertion once again we see that it is a negative spiral inward because of the belief in the myth of the white mans invincibility it is also a desire to prove to ones ego and to the white man that a black man is creative out of this frustration of contradictions sprout black cults and mysticism ie withdrawal symptoms the black artist becomes more of a nihilist than a creative person he perceives blackfolk as his burden instead of his inspiration the center of the universe becomes an overglorification of his ego african history and paradoxically the black masses through constructive criticism and the existence of correct ideology many of the straightupanddown cultural brothers and sisters will redirect their creativeness and become functional people embraced by a revolutionary political structure black nation concept imbedded in the rationale of most brothers seeking a new black nation are withdrawal symptoms resembling those of the backtoafrica brothers the black nation concept does notand cannot deal with the fact that black peo pie built america by their enchained sweat blood and brains america is ours for the take withdrawing from america does not weaken or eradicate its racism to the contrary in withdrawal america is strengthened and offered an almost perfect framework for black genocide white america would view the new black nation as a black communist threat more concretely judging from the types of brothers and sisters who expound defend and rally around this idea it exudes the belief that it is impossible to liberate black people within the awesomely powerful confines of white america hence the new black nation concept reeks with contradictions one of the most blatant contradictions is that of white people being willing to pay for the birth of a black nation on the one hand the new nation separatists vividly describe america as being by naturea racist country that has systematically excluded blackfolk from all its institutional processes indeed this is true then by what twist of fate would white racist america wish to aid in the development of a black nation right at its doorstep unless exploitation and genocide was in mind many of the new nation separatists suggest that scattered blackcontrolled cities constitute a nation this contradiction has been discussed above a federation of cities as a nation is stressed rather than the evolutionary development of revolutionary nationalism among black people many discuss the idea of a getting electoral control of the cities and the black belt then b inviting the united nations as world observer of white america because c international law allows five or six southern states to secede from the union history has exposed the united nations as anything but humanistic and neutral history has shown that the united nations and its international laws are mere tools of america and its western allies for the maintenance of their imperialist machine witness the united states breach of the geneva conventions decisions concerning vietnam witness the arabisraeli conflict witness the u ss instantaneous intervention into the dominican republic in witness the congo interventionbut no intervention in south africa it is crystal clear that the international laws deal with nonwhites exactly in the same manner as americas constitutional laws as colonial subjects the republic of new africa appoints brother robert f williams as presidentinexile robert f williams is a romantic revolutionary partially of his own makings and partially because he has not been continually on the american scene being a brother exiled in the third world one should take note of the other governmentsinexile such as the tiny antimaoist island of formosa and the counterrevolutionary claguided revolutionary angolan government in exile when the socalled leader or groups are not in physical and spiritual touch with their people they fall prey to romanticism and cooptation when the new nation concept fails to understand the relationship between military strategy and geography we witness a pathetic and selfdefeating contradiction the republic of new africa is to be created from the southern states j east of texas and north of florida strategically florida would be i come an ideal american military base in terms of military strategy for the new republic of new africa it would have to spread its forces to defend three land borders the north south and west in brief the new nation concept is the pipedream of black nationalists frustratedly overwhelmed because of their simplistic approach to white racism and colonialism revolutionary nationalism in conclusion if we are for the liberation of black people then we must seek the correct path towards revolution that is the path of revolutionary nationalism more precisely we must seek change change in institutions change in who is in charge change in values then we must be able to implement and enforce these changes in other words america as it exists today must be completely destroyed and then rebuilt in the terms of the new black manfor whites have rendered themselves incapable of humanistic creativity the methodology for correct revolutionary nationalism is comprised of reformist stages dialogues designed to change negroes into blacks education lifelong commitment and consistent criticism of self and ideology and most important winning the confidence of black people brother bill strickland constantly reiterates and correctly so that there has been no critique of the american society visavis black reality there have only been reactions to the system and not a development of a countersystem why because black intellectuals accept white analysis as the correct analysis this has historically resulted in black people acting more like accommodationists and withdrawers than resisters this is not to deny the historical fact of daily slave rebellions or the current urban uprisings it is merely to emphasize that our actions have been apolitical and oftentimes vacuous because of a lack of a black critique of the american scene further negative consequence of blacks dependency upon white analysis is the legitimacy of corruptness within the black movement because whites are corrupt and immoral their liberalradical analysis is corrupt and immoral the movements corruption is just the symptom the flame one of the root causesor fuels is the absence of a welldefined line rhetoric serious black terminology is loosely thrown around by integrationists separatists and pseudorevolutionaries the black fascists a doyourownthing atmosphere surrounding the movement makes it valid for an accommodationist like whitney young and his urban league colleagues to support black_power it makes it valid for an opportunist such as roy innis to negotiate with the colonial powers for the sake of black selfdetermination and black economic power the rootlessness of the terminology invites a myriad of wierd immoral and agent prococateurs to satisfy their twisted and often antiblack lusts we will see that through a tightly defined terminology of black morality will develop its existence will transpose every actincluding the sexual actinto an ethical and political act this is not to say that the black movement will be entrenched in rigidity a black morality will naturally mean firmness and flexibility the black moralitys vitality lies in its ability to define confine and refine our liberation struggle it is the black aethestics becoming ethical and the black ethics becoming aethestical it is the black man seeing himself as a revolutionary more than that it is the brother or sister who asserts that to be a revolutionary is to be for life never forgetting that we must have an undying love for our people we must struggle to learn and learn to struggle audre lordes the first cities the poets press inc is a quiet introspective book you first notice the striking phrases the crash of passing sun a browning laughter the oyster world then you notice the images most of them drawn from nature a source unusual in this age of urban poets who write of concrete and machines but audre lorde is not a nature poet her focus is not on nature but on feelings and relationships the nature images many of them pertaining to the seasons illustrate inner weather the changes of love or feelings earth is still sweet for autumn teaches bearing and new sun will warm our proud and cautious feet but spring came once and we have seen the road that led through summer beautiful and bright as clover on a hill become a vast appalling wilderness and rain while we stood still racked on the autumns knowing audre lorde writes of birth now that i am forever with child my head rang like a fiery piston my legs were towers between which a new world was passing of death in father son and holy ghost each week a different woman regular as his one quick glass each evening pulls up the grass his stillness grows of love in the limpid a lovers song give me fire and i will sing you morning finding you heart and a birth of fruit give me fire and i will sing you evening asking you water and quick breath she does not wave a black flag but her blackness is there implicit in the bone in suffer the children those who loved them remember their childs laughter but he whose hate has robbed him of their good has yet to weep at night above their graves some day a man will thirst for sleep in his southern night and in coal love is a word another kind of open as a diamond comes into a knot of flame i am black because i come from the earths inside take my word for jewel in your open light audre lorde for the most part writes in a rhythmic sparsely punctuated free verse sometimes as in to a girl who knew what side her bread was buttered on she uses rime and we notice the emphasis and the richness of sound which rime imparts audre lordes poems are not strident and do not grab you by the collar and drag you in but they attract you by their fresh phrasing which draws you to return to them and to discover new evocations dudley randall a young sister audrey lee from the city of brotherly love has penned her first novel the clarion people mcgraw hill catherine marshall has said on the back cover audrey lee gives us a close look at the havoc wrought on the sensitive spirit of one human being by the concrete jungle of a great city with its impersonality and its callousness here at last realism is carried beyond superficial recording of ugliness or violence on through passion lets stop right there lillian peoples the protagonist catches a train from a small town to go to the city where her fatherat leastthinks she can get an education in life thats the plot both miss lee and mrs marshall have missed the point of the novel the clarion people shows a writer with much promise for definition and explanation once she begins to live in this world the clarion people shows what can happen to a young girl who decides to submerge the problems she cant deal with and create the ones she can like sex tipping out on god and virginity without city hall giving approval is not really a problem take our word for it miss lee most women get laid at some point without the sanction of god or city hall and some have been known to find it fun there is little doubt that the most christian people in this country and perhaps the most religious people in the world are our people the life situation which unfolds on clarion street says over and over again that faith has nothing to do with how we live lillian peoples like a cracked record repeats if we just keep the faith we will have it made we have kept the faith and found often to our dismay that faith has nothing to do with getting made on her train into the big callous impersonal city and we really think its time we defined the city in terms of black people being controlled by the little callous impersonal suburbs she meets a two bit hustler named nat now if lillian hadnt been fresh from the country she would never have turned her head toward a nat anyway but sources close to the top tell us thats why fresh country girls journey from home is it really worth a novel our sources also report that he who is had wanted to be or as my grandmother was fond of saying the race is not won by the strongest or the swiftest but by he who endures to the end she was probably quoting malcolm put it another way said something bout chickens coming home to roost the question of sex and the black community has intrigued us for some time eldridge cleaver has an excellent essay on it in soul on ice you see black people have no power yet we are supposed to be the most sexually potent people in at least this country only sex is supposed to be animalistic voila we lose again getting a clear sexual conscience isnt necessarily easy what with the dual standard set for black people but already having tried god for at least the last years we canand should look elsewhere for the solution marriage which has been our very dubious privilege only since emancipation hasnt proven an answer either witness the complaining suburbanites we tend to believe excedrin headache number one is a bad lay the questions areand will be for some timewhat are our needs in a given situation and how do we get them filled our need isnt a father image with as many men running in and out of our homes as reports tell us how could we lack a male image it isnt job either at one point we were percent employed lillian peoples wants sex and drugs to be the problem and faith to be the answer it just doesnt work out that way the problemlillians mine and yoursis a problem of lack of power take a look around you miss lee black philadelphia doesnt suffer from a lack of faith it lacks power it does not lack freedom from sin it lacks freedom wed like to see miss lee a young sensitive writer begin to deal with our true problems or to create situations where we win through our power to control if god has as a popular song once said the whole world in his hands then he created clarion streetnot us but we since we are living there must make it what we want it to be regardless of hisor white suburbias wishes perhaps we should as tobacco road tells us tear it down and start all over again then perhaps a new race of men as margaret walker so beautifully said may emerge write about thatnikki giovanni a short story by paula fox fter the funeral we a stood around awhile on the street corner right near the funeral parlor there was a lot of vegetables in crates sitting out in front of a grocery store and i couldnt help my eyes sliding over to those big purple bananas that the puerto ricans buy flies was buzzing over everything but those purple bananas wasnt even sweating like the other fruit flies didnt bother them they lay there looking like they was in a cold cellar they made me feel bad and i dont know why my wifei dont live with her no more but we still marriedshe was crying and moping up her face and pulling at her dress because she was so hot i couldnt stop myself from seeing she was getting fat especially in her shoulders why do i have to notice so much somel times i wish i was a little like her holler when things are bad and n h laugh when its okay but not me im always seeing the things that are all around what i should be paying attention to like when i go for a job im watching the mans face seeing how his teeth fit in his jaws what his shirt cuffs look like and what hes got on his desk instead of asking him where and how much and how long mv wife calls curtis the little baby i dont understand why she thinks hes so little he is old enough to be buried in his cadet suit qu te a few people came to the funeral mostly neighbors i guess even my brother came i havent seen him for eight years and after he looked at curtis lying in the coffin he remarked how big hed grown but then the last time hed seen curtis was just a few months after hed been born when we were still living in brooklyn before we moved uptown what are you looking at those vegetables for when you should be thinking about your dead baby my wife cried and yvonne who is now started howling and grabbed my wife around her middle yvonne looked very neat i noticed and her shoes were all polished up i hadnt seen her for a long time i used to go by and visit them but my wife and i always had to have our fight and it got so the children would just go out of the room to get away so i hardly ever had a chance to talk to them what good is thinking about him going to do him now i asked her you should of thought about him when you let him go up to the roof all the time just so you could be alone to work yourself all up about what a mean bastard i was and how bad i did you she began to yell and moan i couldnt even make out what she was saying i started wondering how they got curtis to look so nice when he had fallen four stories to the street then the grocer came out and waved his hands at us and shouted in spanish calling us names probably most of the people who had come to the funeral had gone off down the street my brother was standing in front of the funeral parlor and talking to light marsh who is my wifes cousin i dont know why he came to curtis funeral thats a man whos hardly interested in anything living or dead except his car but he was going to drive us out to the cemetery so i didnt make my usual remarks about him it was a terrible hot drive light all the time talking about these gadgets hes got for his caddie and pointing at them with his long finger and driving with the other hand while my wife carried on in her corner my brother kept grinning at light and then turning around to look sad at me yvonne rested herself against my ribs and i patted her head and felt sorrier for her than i did for anybody else suddenly she looked up while light and my brother were arguing about which was the fastest way to the cemetery why did they have that doll in the window she asked me at first i didnt know what she meant then i remembered that in the funeral parlor window on a shelf there had been this plastic doll held upright by some kind of metal prong and the doll had a crown and was wearing some kind of lace cape when i first walked in i had noticed how dusty the shelf was and how the crown looked like it was made out of a silver candy wrapper i dont know i answered isnt it supposed to be for dead people why they get that doll then she whispered maybe shes supposed to be a saint of something like that i said dont tell her none of your lies my wife said light had begun to talk about the war and this country and how crazy everything was getting and what hard times were coming and i laughed hard times coming i said what i want to know is when are they goingt you ought to get into a steady business my brother said i think hes been saying that since i was three and he was five you mean like the numbers i asked why dont you go to school and take up something he asked you ought to grab whats there he know all about grabbing said my wife did it hurt curtis yvonne asked all of a sudden i got scared sitting in that big white car that probably had payments left on it with my brother all shut into his best suit and my wife getting fatter every minute and light marsh telling me all about the world and yvonne asking me questions like i was supposed to know everything no baby no it couldna hurt him my wife said he didnt know what hit him the ground hit him yvonne said and sat up straight then pretty soon yvonne starts out with daddy but we was there and i got busy getting out of the car ill never know what she was going to ask me maybe who the hell was i anyhow some of the people who had been at the parlor had got there their own way and they were standing near the hole with the preacher his head was bowed and sweat was running doyn his forehead they had this carpet maybe five feet by five made out of stuff that was supposed to look like grass and it was spread over the dirt they had dug out of curtis grave there were so many gravestones sticking up out of the ground you wouldnt think there was room for one more child the coffin was closed up now it had a sling around it so it could be lowered into the ground there were two men standing a few yards away leaning on shovels gravediggers i guess they were wearing caps and work clothes they didnt have any expression at all on their faces but even so i thought they was laughing at us maybe its because i figure colored people is funny to white people whether theyre dead or alive i had this picture of myselfit was so fast i hardly saw itof me lifting up one of those shovels and bashing their heads in they threw some dirt on curtis and lowered him and i heard the preachers voice getting louder but i couldnt get any sense out of what he was saying the graveyard stretched further than i could see i heard cars so i knew there must be big highways all around light said hed drive us back to the parloi my brother went off with some man who was going his way he shook my hand before he left and told me not to feel too bad and i said yeah id try not to light showed off all the way back asking yvonne would she like a doll and telling me to drop around hed get me a good job and asking how we was paying for all this funeral expense i didnt want to talk about that i gave my wife the thirtyeight dollars i had and she must have got the rest somewhere maybe from her daddy who runs an elevator in an apartment building downtown and has a little house with a yard in the bronx i dont know why he didnt come to curtis funeral maybe because he knew id be there we got out of the car in front of the grocery store my wife wasnt crying anymore but she looked awful her hat was coming down the back of her head and her eyes looked big and starey you want to go to a movie i asked what is the matter with you she said yeah daddy can we go yvonne asked well i thought it would be better so you dont have to go back home right now theres a loews right up here near by she was looking at me but i was looking over her shoulder there were fewer bananas in the box now somebody must have been buying them while we were out putting curtis in the ground dont you feel badt she asked like shed been thinking hard to find the thing to say that would straighten me out i feel bad i said then we all started to walk up the block and pretty soon we came to the movie i didnt look to see what was playing it was cool inside that big black coolness ive always liked about movies hardly anybody was in there a few people with nothing to do getting out of the sun i bought yvonne some peanuts and she settled back in her seat my wife took off her hat and sank down and rested her head they were showing a cartoon it didnt look so good on that big screen the animals had those faces that dont look like anything living or dead and the voices they put in them were screaming and laughing and hooting so loud it made me hunch down in the seat i don t know but i think theres nothing worse than that nothing sadder anyhow than a movie on a hot weekday afternoon with maybe a dozen people sprinkled around watching a cartoon thats supposed to be for children i began to feel so bad sitting there looking at my wifes and yvonnes faces in the light from the screen then looking back at the cartoon and seeing some goddam big mouse in a cape running along the floor that i couldve yelled and then i did yell my wife and yvonne grabbed me up out of the seat and took me up the aisle and i was yelling all the time thinking of how the street would be of those sweating rotting vegetables at the grocers and that plastic doll and light marsh in his white mans car and curtis dead and dressed up like he was going to war and the man i had to see tomorrow about a job sorting packages none of it mattered not even my yelling mattered we were all gone not just curtis but yvonne my wife and me gone gone gone toward a black aesthetic by don l lee hat is a black poet w what is black poetry what is the black aesthetic these and other surface questions have become central topics for discussion at most literary circles and in my estimation need more than surface answers obviously if we deal properly with the three questions posed we will discover some of the basics of black art a black poet is not a negro he is first and foremost a black man or woman he is positive of his identity and has no second thoughts on how he should address himself he fully realizes as sncc points out that the slave traders brought black men and africans to this country not negroes whereas the negro is a filthy invention which didnt come into existence until about these brothers and sisters write out of a concept of self rather than that of a negro or imitation white ie he will relate the black experiencein essence his true experiencewhich is a result of his lifestyles undoubtedlythe true black experience in most cases is very concrete and is opposed to any unrelated abstractions concrete sleeping in subways being bitten by rats six people living in a kitchenette the images and symbols that are used will come out of the poets immediate surroundings and will accent his particular lifestyle this means that black poets will deal with themselves as individuals first and then will move toward a concept of peoplehood better yet they will move from the i to the we to the us and to the our the black poet is at all times in tune with his people he is an integral part of the black community a guiding force a walking example as opposed to a walking contradic tion black for the black poet is a way of life as brother marvin x has said the black poet must study his own poems heretofore negro arists and writers there are exceptions were too busy playing artist and writer imitating white boys that is they were too busy with their thing to be intimately concerned with their people today as far as the black poet is concerned black people come first people then art what good or use is art without the people also what good is art if it doesnt communicate with the people black poets write out of a concept of art for peoples sake and not art for arts sake we feel that art for arts sake is an invalid concept and belongs back in greece bc the poet in studying his own poems in essence continually studies himself the black poet is writing to black people and not to whites also in studying his own poetry and the poetry of other black poets the black poet as well as his readers will receive directionpositive direction black poets will live their poems they themselves will be poems black poets do not tell the people the danger of white filth and then dwell in such filth themselves black poets do not tell of the death of dope and other drugs and turn around and use such extremes of death themselves black poets will be examples of their poems and if their poems are righteous the poet will be righteous and he will be a positive example for the black community not another contradictor black poetry not only gives positive direction to the community but shows the people black beauty and black substance our poetry will enable the people to see themselves and as opposed to most scientific data realize that we are universal and are the first people black poets blkartists per se are culture stabilizers bring back old values and introduce new ones black poets are continually defining and redefining present values and will help destroy anything that is detrimental to our advancement as a people black poetry will give the people a future will show visions of tomorrow as leroi jones puts it we must in the present be missionaries of blackness of consciousness actually in the coming chaos any place of knowledge any vessel any collection of black consciousness will create a polarity people then will want to know what to do tell them now as you would then as they run through the streets looking for safety you see black poetry will not necessarily teach the people how to die but will teach the people how to live we must live we must show those who control the world how to live redefine man and put man in his proper perspective in relation to other men and to the world we must move that white boy toward righteousness show him what a human being is and can be show him what sister jewel c latimore calls utopia brothers brothers everywhere and not a one for sale talk for days to blkpeople and tell them that we are universal but define for them as brother ethridge knight does no universal laws of human misery create a common cause or common history that ease black peoplese pains nor break black peoples chains of course everywhere you turn you will be confronted with superidiots who will say with exasperated authority that you are writing protest poetry but we will not swing on the cat not yet at least we will as brother keorapetse kgositsile has done explain what black poetry is i do not write protest poetry my poetry is a love poetry check out any black ghetto in the world listen to the songs that move people to the innovation of all kinds of dances and crazy hollers and tell me if that is not love my poetry is that spirit throbbing with the love of millions of black people all over the world but the impulse is personal black poetry comes out of a love for ones self what is at the bottom a love of ones people how can you really love yrpeople if you dont love yrself and im not talking about narcissism brother kgositsile is more than accurate when he calls his poetry love poetry its the love of ones people that is embodied in his poetry the will to survive as a nation of black people blackness transcends all artificial bordersblackness will speak of and to the third world when norman jordan talks of feeding the lions the black brothers and sisters in africa as well as in mississippi will surely understand that lions visit all the black communities they come into our neighborhood with the sun an army of social workers carrying briefcases filled with lies and stupid grins passing out relief checks and food stamps hustling from one apartment to another so they can fill their quota and get back out before dark as brother leroi jones has said and we own the night we not only own the night but we will take the day and make the day a livable place again a place where people can love and create this atmosphere of beautiful days now exists among blkpoets there is a feeling of cooperation and companionship rather than one of competition black poets are not writing for national book awards and pulitzer prizes black poets are not trying to cut each other up there exists a comradeship and closeness that has never beforeespecially in modern literaturebeen able to grow keeping in mind that these young writers most are under understand that they must complement each other rather than compete against one another thev realize that there is a gross need for the talents of all the blkwriters who can be motivated black poets realize as arthur rimbaud points out that poetry will no longer accompany action but will lead it whereas blk poems will talk to blkpeople and will come like daggers broken brew bottles bullets swift razors from blkhands cutting thru slum landlords and negro dope pushers blk poems will talk to pimps prostitutes and will aid in the destruction of their actions will come like napalm raids over the white house all its weird ways blkpoems will tell of the soul in aretha franklins music tell you that her actions are those of doris day will be sisters burning wigs false eye lashes brothers cutting off processes breaking wine bottles over t honkies heads blkpoems will be gangbangers pulling dope needles out of their arms sticking them into the pushers eyes blkpoems are death to the unrighteous and birth to the truthbringers blk poems are a part of the people an energy source for the peoples lifestyles blkpoems will talk of the kingdoms of africa will speak in zulu swahili will talk in muthafuckas and can you dig it blk poems will be the music blkpeople will dance by will be the weapon used to wipeout nbc cbs abc the myth of the blue eyed soul brother black poems are leroi jones and larry neal is gwendolyn brooks and margaret walker is sonia sanchez and sarah fabio is clarence major and ed spriggs black poetry will be the criticism and poetry of askiamuhammad toure will be ahmed le graham alhamisi and kafi wangara blk poems will be clean communities for black children and will brine mr mrs colored middle class back and will show them where theyve been blkpoems will talk in real acts and not in dreams will be spoken by eugene perkins and s e anderson will pierce the heart and listen to alicia a johnson and larry miller black poems will compliment the art of tom feeling and omar lama will be read to the music of coltrane and sun ra black poems will come from and have the delivering power of brothers slick campbell and ebon dooley margaret danner will talk of africa and carolyn rodgers will give you chicago black poetry will be read in negro digest and the journal of black poetry will come in soulbook and black dialogue will be created in black expressions and liberator with black poetry and other flames of blkart will be the black esthetic as brother larry neal relates it there is no need to establish a black esthetic rather it is important to understand that one already exists i agree with brother neal a blkaesthetic does exist but how does one define it in reference to literature or is it necessary to define it i suggest at this time that we not try however understand that the blkesthetic exists and will continue to be embodied in the work of black artists painters novelists poets etc and will be determined from the forthcoming and existing body of black works dig nobody talked about a white aesthetic until there was an adequate body of work to determine such an aesthetic white critics didnt exploit the joyceian prose until james had put it down nobody talked about the diction of hemingway until the cuban had recorded it on paper you see the white aesthetic if there is such a thing is definable by examining the greater body of western literature black literature as we know it is relatively new this is not to negate the contributions of du bois mckay wright and other blkliterary greats but to realize that these men were primarily addressing themselves to white audiences in the weeks months and years to come black critics will be reading and examining the new black literature and they not white boys will determine what the black aesthetic is as brother clarence major has said we black poets can write poems of pure creative black energy right here in the white west and make them works of art without falling into the cheap marketplace of bull and propaganda and i submit that this is happening from the african dialect of ruwa chiri to the verse of dudley randall from the can you kill nigger of nikki giovanni to the two and three hard lines of mari evans we as black writers have accepted for too long almost without question the assertion that the white way is the right way at last we are able to comprehend that black people see nothing in the same frame of reference as white people not only do we receive and perceive differently but our reaction is noticeably opposed to that of whites check out a whiteoriented fashion show and compare that to the swing of an african fashion showingwe not only can see the difference but feel it rhythm we as blkpoets write out of a concept of self a black thing knowledgeable at all times that mistakes will be made that there will be disappointments and disagree j ments but realizing that these are the actions of black men and black artists we will determine standards of judgment and excellence and no white boys in the pages of the nation the new republic saturday review new york times etc will direct or effect our efforts black people will direct us direction will be a reciprocal process shared between black people black artists and as sister gloria house has said you cant just go and ask anybody man cause dig they just dont know they aint been where you go everyday they aint been through your neighborhood man they cant give you no directions m by sarah webster fabio ho speaks negro w any black man whos on top of whats happening i arrived at this conclusion in an essay published in negro digest which was written originally in as a result of my being questioned in regard to melvin tolsons language and karl shapiros evaluation of that language by the threemember examining board during the oral examination for an ma degree in creative writingpoetry at san francisco state college it began then as a reaction to others acts others questionings others thoughts on the subject of colonization and decolonization in language at the time i focused my attention on negro language without properly defining for myself the term negro action and not reaction is a meaningful response to black people don l lee has a fine poem that warns us of the danger of this it is called react for action at any rate the casual questioning by curious bemused white professors bugged me into seriously beginning to explore the unchartered waters of black awareness for myself now three years later in answer to this same question id say every negro speaks negro to a greater or lesser degree for a black writer however a far more relevant question is who speaks black language what is black in the past a poet could be notoriously negro in one poem and very black in another or black in ideology and perspective but negro in the use of the standard english language or vice versa scratch a negro and you will find a nigger and a potential black man scratch a black man and you may find a nigger and the remnants of a negro negro is a psychological sociological and economical fabrication to justify the status quo in america nigger is the tension created by a black mans attempt to accommodate himself to become a negro in order to survive in a racist country black is the selfhood and soul of anyone with one drop of black blood in america who does not deny himself black is most of the writing of paul laurence dunbar richard wright john o killens margaret walker leroi jones langston hughes although exceptions are found here black is the writings of don l lee and carolyne rodgers black pride and think black broadside press and paper soul third world press lerone bennett jr and hoyt fuller the black community has always knownand it is becoming apparent to the worldthat america wants negroes and niggers but not black people don l lee articulates this america calling negroes can you dance play foot baseball nanny cook needed now negroes who can entertain only others not wanted are considered extremely dangerous john o killens dubbed america the land of the nigger makers james baldwin makes reference to the observation that the negroinamerica is a form of insanity which overtakes white men the negro is a pathology baldwin also has said that there is no negro finally who has not had to make his own precarious adjustment to the nigger who surrounds him and to the nigger in himself being black then is a reaffirmation of selfhood it is a meaningful antidote to white racism it is a move toward deniggerizing the world population of nonwhite people and of humanizing the white people black is biology geography africa west indies ugaunited ghettos of americathe wrong side of the tracks or freeways black belts black is psychology theology philosophy athletic aesthetic politic it is frantz fanon martin_luther_king jr w e b du bois marcus garvey stokely carmichael aaron douglas and charles white muhammad ali and harry edwards adam clayton powell black language is direct creative intelligent communication between black people based on a shared reality awareness understanding which generates interact tion it is a rhetoric which places premium on imagistic renderings and concretizations of abstractions poetic usages of language idiosyncrasiesthose individualized stylistic nuances such as violation of structured syntaxwhich nevertheless hit home and evoke truth it is an idiom of integrated insight a knowledge emanating from a juxtaposition of feeling and fact which form a perspective of now causing perpetual changes of meaning a major question on my spring final examination in afroamerican literature was define black language and give examples of im portant black words considered this a serious difficult question and so did my students at merritt junior college in oakland calif where black awareness is a highly developed reality during the spring black experience the negro was done away with in an effectively eulogized funeral ceremony i must admit an indebtedness to robert decoy whose the nigger bible contained some words over of these derivatives of nigger suggesting a burlesque i accepted the challenge in his word i have made the feeble and sincere attempt to begin your dictionary of niggeramerican words perhaps you or some other who come after will improve add to and complete this particular language have chosen to start with black words rather than negroor nigger words because they are acts of afm firmation rather than reactions at this stage of my research i have upward of words many words have multiple meanings and separate entry listings my dictionary of black language is proving to be very rewarding and gratifying research some of the student definitions and words were that language particular to all biologically black persons it is to them their own means of communication defying explanation a rappingto talk to someone for a period on a subject pertaining to blackness b togetheran adjective describing a persons philosophy and total awareness pertaining to blackness the beautiful way black people communicate with one another a proof if nothing else of a definite and separate distinct culture complex a niggera tag filled with hateandor love used by every black person b brothera unifying greeting in a black community a dialect of english a means by which a black person can comfortably communicate with another black person without the fear of using improper rhetoric because he is correct every time his improvisational words ring true a come down explain stop beating around the bush b jivephony not for real all means of communication used by black people to express themselves not necessarily verbal ones ie the clenched fist among black people means unity for whites it is a symbol of violence and hatred drums music wails hollers a honkologya study of the logic of white thought b dust money a necessary means of communication among black people in order to relate certain aspects of their lives which could never be accomplished through the usage of socalled proper form of anglosaxon english which is unrelated to the black experience in any positive relevant way a language of feeling rather that just thought or talk soul talk forreal downtoearth nittygritty communication and finally the most important question at this stage of black awareness becomes not who speaks black but rather what is black my latest poem explores this mystique black is pigmentation a mirror image of black on black a preference that leans away from fading colors and imitation whites posture an onyourtoes approach to the mazeway of the real world a shoulder squared against whats happeningthe man the hawk bad luck blues a motion a dance a gesture a cool stance a walking that walk talking that talk that is now man position apartness uniqueness a separatism permitting cutting through white irrelevancies to confront basic issues a revolutionary zeal to overthrow oppressive might a moral obligation to change a wrong to a right perspective a clear black eye that peers through the midnight muck of man a deniggerized aspect and value a defiant thrust to wipe out white wash positives of assertive acts affirmations a strong yes not negatives invisibility non entity pride people power people magic soul an exuberance of existence an escalation of self awareness and appreciation gut knowing buried deep in the womb of oppression turning stone to bone to flesh and blood and tears and smiles to love to life pulling pulling a magnet pulling you all the way back home into a thing that is black young black poets by william keorapetse kgositsile here are new voices very different from the ones that were around before different not only in the sense that they are new but essentially because of their attitude and intended purpose precise as tools in the hands of skillful artisans lebert bethune tired of strange ghosts whose cool bones lived on the green furnace of my blood makes a juju of my own as one of the means of baking my destiny to a lullaby he continues his song so she warned me my grandmother and now and now when i kindle again her small eyes with their quick lights darting ancient love into my infancy and when i break through to her ancient voice that voice like the pliant red clay she baked she sings the only lullaby she sang me me no care for bakra whip me no care fe fumfum come juju come so i am fashioning this thing my own juju out of her life and our desire out of an old black love i am baking my destiny to a lullaby lebert bethune in juju of my own a slim volume of robust poetry like most of his peers he has been through american institutions of higher learning and come back disillusioned it is no secret today that any honest blackman in any western institution learns sooner or later that there is a calculated denial of his history of his experience by his oppressor he is taught to aspire to western ideals finally he is taught to understand and interpret his historical experience his present existence and his possibilities through white eyes but any time is with us and if we take control to shape our attitudes and reshape our memories that time is always nowour time for the best possible uses of our lives show the chains let them see the chains as object and subject and let them see the chains fall away says leroi jones so there are these voices which attempt to move us in a very specific direction criticizing us here encouraging us there clarifying for us elsewhere you might say that they are voices from the future and they attempt to prepare us because they know that the future will not change to make room for the undesirable the weak will be strengthened if there is any life left in them and memories of past or future or any time are made of very specific selections from your sensibility memories move us the best possible uses of our fives move us and if we are ahead of the times the responsibility is ours to make the present our time lest we be destroyed gloria house celebrates the new day our time look for mind seering into the future with the intensity of their satellites in orbit and you will find it in our heads and for power latent and imminent like the panthers in our bodies we were not made eternally to weep steady slow knowing like ma rainey with her man the forces of time move on to our time and in these days uncovered the great deceits of the mans monstrous mind uprooted his stone monuments to himself destroyed the armies of the psychotic decadent dead a race of devils yes this decadethe sixtieshas produced a different caliber of black poets in america the majority of them have been influenced by negritude and protest poets and writers like cesaire senghor david diop langston hughes claude mckay w e b du bois and others these young poets felt the inadequacy of a purely cultural or artistic selfdetermination because the arguments for it and its artifacts generally boil down to an academic masturbation or deviation a kind of mannerismfornicating with the white eye and then emerging on some stage with western arguments for the validity and glory of a black virginity cesaire though among the negritude poets is above this because he is right there seering into the future with the best of the younger poets in practical terms for instance the younger poets realize that the most beautiful poem senghor can write about the validity of the existence of a glorious black culture without attempting to make the social institutions in senegal actually african actually liberated from france does not even improve the diet of a single undernourished black child anywhere in the world where black people are colonized by caucasians most probably not even in independent senegal this does not mean that negritude andor protest poetry is not valid or functional it is but it is inadequate in terms of its best possible social relevance or uses because it is limited to vision it justifies black art and black experience to a white audience here again aime cesaire is clean because to him negritude was an introductory element a prelude to the reemergence of the blackman on the stage of history the young afroamerican poets whose consciousness was awakened and facilitated by negritude and protest poetry among other influences feel an urgency to make their art as potent a weapon as any in the assertion not birth of their humanism in a poem titled the people burning leroi jones realizes it is choice now like a philosophical problem it is choice now and the weight is specific and personal it is not an emotional decision there facts and who was it said that this is a scientific century jones is not addressing white america or some ideal universal intellect or conscience he is talking to his people about his condition finally theirs because he is his people most of these young writers of this decade after verifying the facts with all the historical evidence necessary emerge strongly convinced of the inhumanity of the western world they come out of western institutions of higher learning strongly convinced that the university in the west is an extension of racism and the socalled cold war which they detest quite often the war is hot past any possible argument for or against it emmett till james powell lumumba malcolm little babies charred while worshipping a western god for the perverted amusement of deranged maniacs and the black poets sensibility explodes the weight becomes specific and personal but the poet does not have explosives for the physical destruction of the west in general and america in particular not yet thus the immediate resort for the black poet is applied poetry he uses his sensibility as ammunition brotherly love virtue construction which by definition embraces and transcends the necessary destruction restoration of human and humane values for the salvation of man now now i see it like this you see da tree ou der its a good shade tree in ne summertime an you know don nobody like to see dey shade tree cud down thus gloria house in her alabama farmers dialectic the alabama farmer like any other colonized person knows that the struggle for liberation is not easy because the oppressor does not want him to be liberated don nobody like to see dey shade tree cud down it is recognition and acknowledgement it leads to resolution it is dialectic after the farmer has looked around and observed some truths we been dat tree for dem folk for a lotta summers for instance he makes the necessary resolution well i cain be no shade tree all my life dat tree got to come down one a dese days aint dat right for gloria the making of a poetry is not escapist exploration or fantasy that could be shattered to smitherings the moment she ventures into the real world of the beauty of concrete human possibilities or the slime of decadent brutes she never leaves actuality her language reflects this the words she chooses to mold and project the images and symbols to celebrate the nature of her revelationsacts are very contemporary that is they come directly from the world around her her sensibility is informed by the pulse of actual not imagined or imaginary people from alabama and all points white of her vision she was down in alabama giving that pulse form direction she lived and worked with communities in alabama she has been in southern jails for attempting to help the people to cud dat tree down she was working with sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee down south when sncc graduated from the civil_rights schools and late in she came to new york to tell a conference of civil_rights lawyers why it was time for sncc to be unconditionally an afroamerican revolutionary movement gloria has lived elsewhere with her eyes open sensitive to her condition as a black woman under white domination as witness direction political advice for young brothers its like where you live man and who lives there with you for example you from harlem yeah well coulda been johannesburg or birmingham alabama you know its all the same im from fillmore that makes us brothers man like we grew up in the same family you dig like every attunedtothetwentiethcentury selfrespecting black man and woman gloria believes in unity and panafricanism and she realizes that young brothersyoung in terms of awareness of the world we live inhave problems of identity especially if they grew up in western democratic societies i mean like if you get shaky about stuff like who you are and where youre going ask somebody who lives near you cause thats where its at man theyll set you straight you cant just go and ask anybody man cause dig they just dont know they aint been where you go everyday very intimate and direct this is education because in any culture education serves to prepare people to be clear about their roles to tap their potential so that their lives can be meaningful so that they can better consolidate their resources and be productive in and useful to their communities the colonial situation is changing the world over the relations between colonizer and colonized are changing in america and elsewhere gloria observes and informs us that they already dance to our drums elemental rhythm of life attuned to the movement of the earth the language in this poem like the period it celebrates is dramatic and pulsates with a divine arrogance it is not however a declaration of war the war is onhas been on this is a song celebrating change the images bathed in the blood that flows when slaves turn men burning plantations be they in newark or kinsangani there is a new chief in the land and all the people will imitate the customs of his tribe and dancing to his heartbeat in his own compound one night at the time they will see his face and they will be astounded that it is black but there are signs of the revolution the young turks of the nation are ours glorias clarity of vision also enables her to see our internal contradictions as a result she can be boldly critical of our mistakes andor hangups as in woman to has the length of one man alone so blurred your view can you leave the sons and daughters of our time motherlessno poems no brown daughter no acts of violence for love squandered on one man you see you have to clearly understand that because we do not have a long active collective memory of popular revolutionary movements because we have endured abuse and all sorts of other perversions so long because we were dehumanized and depersonalized to a point where we didnt really believe that we could rise as powerful men to threaten and damage the power of the oppressor we developed a tendency to put all our hopes in individual courageous men who better reflected the desires and aspirations we were too afraid to own up to to name a few from contemporary history for instance malcolm muhammad ali patrice lumumba kwame nkrumah rap brown the danger in this sort of tendency is that should the given hero die or should he be killed or run out of the country we are left without direction without even the necessary selfconfidence which would mean that we had shifted all our necessary responsibility from our shoulders to those of a given personality this is criminal this makes us traitors to our cause virtually and gloria comments this is not malcolms sister who sits sobbing for the love of one man while the nation groans for birth yes you see gloria house is striving for truth a measure to facilitate her explorations forever digging past pretenses and whatever superficial images of ourselves our world and our possibilities as barbara simmons might say this aint art its real movin there are other forces in glorias company here is a b spellman for instance looking into himself and other similar victims he readily acknowledges the ugliness he sees how stay clear in this place do not eat soap relevance pays there squats mundanity kick it in the nuts its crotch swallow your foot now where are you footless hiss of the hideous you goofed in the tactic ab youre still too quiet break something larger but there is more to us than those hideous tendencies we detest if we are honest a b moved by one of our spiritual heroes john coltrane sings him an impartial review may he have new life like the fall fallen tree wet moist rotten enough to see shoots stalks branches green leaves may the roots grow into his side jones says poetry is music made less abstract and i agree because poems dont mean if they are honest like the honest explorations of music throbbing with life does a charlie parker riff mean anything poems are acts in motion and acts processes which involve action and reaction lead inevitably to other acts confrontation forever moving towards resolving whatever other contradiction and i learned that recently after sufficient soulsearching a b spellman left new york to be involved in more direct concrete and relevant acts in black communities in the south listen a little more often to coltrane and then there is edward spriggs whose poetry is adequately representative of the sentiments of the younger afroamerican poets edward s spriggs is new york editor of black dialogue a meeting olace for voices of the black communitywherever that community may exist spriggs states unequivocally my forefathers brought upon this continent phvsical strength intelligence creativity beauty humanism an unparalleled faith and more only the physical strength and that faith has been allowed to function in this consciousless place our intelligence our creativity our beauty and our humanism must be forced now by us upon the universeupon ourselves even spriggs argues that anvthing representative of america as she exists now is a threat to keen the blackman in perpetual bondage psychological and physical even the symbols of american liberty must be destroyed because white americas concept of liberty and justice is a perversion that must be irrevocably shoved out of our existence the statue of libertv must go that bitch must vacate our minds spriggs has no explanations to make to the white world his dialogue is strictly with black people if he incites excites instructs or entertains he does so to and for black people his ability to look at the mirror of life boldly and shamelessly his sensibilitys functioning as an inevitable receptacle of his peoples collective soul makes him one of our spokesmen he is hopefully not preoccupied with merely analyzing and articulating our misery wright baldwin killens and many otherstheir shortcomings asidehave done that fairly competently already he looks at america and sees in her ghettos all of the material conveniences of the western world he observes for instance in a short photographic poem on harlem the jewowned bars barbecue joints and many other enterprises where black people live in squalor finally he reveals that the only thing owned by black people in harlem is death this is the american experience which molded his sensibility he lives in a period during which millions of people are murdered at random for the preservation of american dollarism sharpeville vitenam santo domingo harlem watts detroit newark and many more places responsibility to see his people move from all things south imposes itself upon him with an unrelenting passion he apparently has a black conscience chauvinism it depends on what the reader of spriggs relates to after all even the oppressor taught him that cleanliness begins at home he is far from being sentimental he expresses the collective soul of the ghetto and tries to give direction because he is inherently part and parcel of the moving black mass he does not appeal to the conscience of white america because white america has no conscience instead he appeals to his people to pray not for the poet saints pray instead saints for his critics the critics of course are the white murderers who want to control everything including the black poets creativity but spriggs creativity cannot be checked by adolescent fascists disguised as literary critics because he is the bearer of truth spriggs asserts a poet must would give truth substance form truth needs a second career so crack the other side black poet that it be felt that it be looked at into evidently poets like spriggs know the truth is essentially the poets business spriggs also believes that after the poet has stood truth on her feet again unveiled unadulterated a lot of cleaning up remains to be done the western white man has made the world a filthy place because of the damage done by the western white man the blackman is even alienated from himself so in order that the job ahead be done efficiently black poets must make sons quick using magic substances black poets must make soul anew must crack the pods let the semen fly must carve epitaphs on their volume numbers spriggs seems to have undergone a psychological and creative rebirth he got rid of the western bourgeois esthetic he is then a modern day witchdoctor whose art and expression are a way of life pulsating with love of life and love since he cannot relate to it he rejects the white frame of reference he was programmed into from the very first day he went to kindergarten he seems to have established a new frame of referenceghettooriented because the black community in a whitedominated society is what he directly relates to spriggs language is free is full of the free ghetto cadence and colorful beauty is afroamerican is delicately sensitive even in the midst of his unrelenting fury is mystic is magical is movingnot in search of but in the assertion and restoration of truth is present like the condition that molded his mind truth is presenthappening languagepulse is heart is myth is vatic is poetry poetry like any other art form is meaningless that is has no use beauty and good inseparableunless it be a specific act actual as dance or childbirth carved bleeding from history our experience tears scorched to deep tracks on the mine laborers back recording the national epitaph walls and what shapes people your memory clarity is not a thought process but a way of life there are many many more young men and women with a sense of mission across these united states you might run into some of them in small magazines like negro digest soulbook black dialogue the journal of black poetry freedomways liberator presence africaine transition the back issues of black orpheus and the new african yet others you might run into only at poetry readings in harlem or newark or some other black community across this country these are transitional men and women moving to the elemental rhythms of our time transitional because they are trying in our time through their rhythms to deniggerfy us to bathe our pulse in revolutionary passions attempting as leroi jones would sing to look into black skulls and teach white people their death but before one can be most effectively instrumental in freeing a people he must first himself be free so that he strives to assert and live up to what he has and its possibilities not what he in frustration desires to have one looks forward to a period when the majority of these young poets abandon mannerism and get directly involved in very concrete community action when the state of black desire becomes an everyday act to satisfy that desire and split the skies with human and humanistic possibilities they will be free then like their rhythms and so will be the rest of us the rhythms coming directly from the way we live then we will join nina simone and sing and now we are one let my soul rest in peace at last it is done my soul has been renewed thet will help you to believe you are learning now about the american revolution the declaration of independence the founding fathers and the constitution and each morning in class you place your hand over your heart and pledge allegiance to the flag and to country of your birth and it all has meaning for you you are an american and that proud heritage represented by the events and documents and words you are learning is your heritage but soon you will begin to learn other things things which inevitably will leave you in a quandary things which will force you to call into question the meaning of the events and documents and words you have treasured you will learn that for you the heritage in which you have had pride also has emptiness and the knowledge will break your heart we who are older who have traveled the way you must go have not yet found a method of sparing you that heartbreak we want you to believe what you are learning now for the passions and the principles which brought into being the american revolution the declaration of independence and the constitution represent humankind at its noblest we want you to believe in these things even as we concede in sadness that you will need strength beyond what we can give you to hold on to your belief in the world that awaits you

black theatergo home if a new black theater is to be born sustain itself and justify its own being it must go home go home psychically mentally esthetically and i think physically now what does all that mean first off what do i myself mean by a new black theater i mean the ritualized reflection and projection of a unique and particular way of being bom of the unique and particular conditioning of black people leasing time on this planet controlled by whitemen and having something to do with the breaking of that leasingsyndrome a theater emerging from artists who realize that for black people of this world and specifically this country every quote universal human malady dilemma desire or wonder is by the heat of the pressure of whiteracism compounded and enlarged agitated and aggravated accented and distilled to make that omnisuffusing grinding sense of being we once called the blues but might now just term blackness from this peculiar and particular extradimension of being of experiences of conditioning will come the kind of theater im looking for out of the fact that something as universal as the innerdrive and desire for success takes on a different shade another prickpoint when it is beneath a black skin there are some strange bilevel goals some other further obstacle considerations involved out of the fact that even love vibrates to these ultraearthy subterranean accents love for family for woman for friend for self are all touched somehow somewhere by this infrashadow and it is from this deep shadow that will come this new theater i am seeing come in many brilliant new forms of enlightenment illumination it will be a theater having to do with love of ones self and ones personal national and international family with wariness and hatred of ones personal national and international enemies with ideally points as to how to break their grip and splatter their power now let me stay right in here a minute i want to make sure i get across at least some hint of all the levels i see here try a couple more parables examples similies or whatever allright so lets take the french film black orpheus a sweet bright touching thing just good to see a woman like that in full color but to make it afroamerican orpheus there would have to be some extending and deepening of dimensions understand me a writer in the new black theater might want to make the hell the death the girls going into the whiteworld rejecting not only orpheus but all other cats and things black that would be the hell and orpheus going to get her back with just courage and con and a song would really be some thing wouldnt it and how could he not look back at the past at the promises of the devil yeh deep stuff tragic and neither shaw oneill nor any of those other great ones could write it not within this level of blackness im talking about i can almost feel some of you thinking racism pure racism well i dont know now all the universal implications messages of the tale are still there what this imaginary writer has done is to put hell up on earth where it belongs and say that it has something to do with rejecting your own people and images for other people and images and if there is racism in it it only makes it more validly of this time and of this world your fire driving others fires out of your brain now that little adaptation points at just one level of what im visualizing but there will be so many other levels coming simultaneously levels of love and joy and strength and courage like how did bighearted bigbellied george jones this elevatoroperator pullmanporter foundryflunky keep that deep clean laughter goingraise all those kids and keep that strong groovy woman swept all those years on it how did he do it how come everybody in the barbershop poolroom workhouse and everywhere is glad to see him coming turning to him to warm their psychic and spiritual hands how why who what cant you see him in a bluelight sitting up on the side of the bed plotting next weeks billdodging and billpaying with all of them asleep except maybe her lying there touching his back now and then telling him to get some rest but in the morning with still no answers in sight hes got the right glowing laugh of confidence to send those kids on out ready to run through those prejudice teachers and all that other crapto look for something he never saw now how does he do that he knows whats happening hes been through a thousand hunky overseers on a thousand poisonous jobs hes had to dodge and stall the buzzards so long he can smell em a month away now how hes some huge terrific soul stretching his lowceilinged cage all out of shapedefeating it even while it kills him a peculiar and particularly tragichero made both tragic and heroic by his way with a particularly peculiar poisonous situation getting george jones and that deep resilient lady of his and their indigo moments on stage is being in another level of the new black theater so many levels all levels because there is no personal style or hangup or revelation that cant be worked out within and through the stances and situations of black people through the questions and answers in the rightnow relevance frequency we must tune ourselves and our audiences into in order to nurture race self and art a writer coming this way won t lack in his work any of those universal everyone screams about not if he has any in him if you look for em youll find em even in the comic strips but he will become involved in the projection of a certain uniqueness that is his hardearned birthright now any of you who know about writing or about speechmaking probably realized that that was the return of the bridge back there that stanza ending in that riff ofrace self art that brings me back to where i started where said that if this theater is to be it mustpsychically mentally esthetically and i feel even physicallygo home im sure you know now what i mean by going home psychically and mentally but just in case let me try to run a short quick summary by psychically i mean coming away from your duespaying to all those outside influences and going into the real black you by way of those places people and experiences which began and had the most to do with the shaping of what is now yourselfmean making works theater out of that and in doing it extending and validating that particular psychic by mentally i mean understanding that you and the experiences of you are in time and history collective repet tons have been repeated and multiplied many times so as artists you are to try to find the terms and the pictures which will most simply clarify those experiences and that knowledge for the yous who do not or could not understand what is or was happening to you and to future yous who will need to be warned and directed in terms from inside that level we call blacknessfor it is within that level that most of the added making or breaking weight comes going home esthetically will follow naturallv after those first two m stepssince your esthetics come out of your mental and psychic environment so i wont eo into the demand for new dynamics for a new intensity of language and form that the material and the desired atmosphere will make on you except to say that the further you go home the more startlingly new and black the techniques become musicians are pointing that out to us now going home physically with the new theater means just that probably i should have started here for this new theater must be housed in sustained and a judged by and be a useable projection of and to a black community the community itself will be the theater and the black artists house of drama like a weirdly fixed and pointed lookingglass a lightprism casting warnings directions fruitful memories and marvelous imaginings on the walls of the doomed or soon to be recreated buildings right there in the community are your materials your situations and conflictsrelevant and powerful when you stand on those streets feeling the human whimpering going on under the beasts muzzle when the myriad poisons are part of your natural everyday elements the needs will either come bursting out of your pens onto your stages or theyll drive you sick with your own faggot cowardice the need to displace and replace pale and dark villains and heroes ideas and concepts images and symbols the need for defined and dramatized hugelydrawn clearly shown walking and talking details as to how to organize community county nation world for a shattering attack against the most voracious powermachine the world has ever known details not stunning poetic generalities details details should be moving around those stages in all kinds of explicit images huffing and puffing and working themselves out of the killing situationsor showing why they cannot pictures of who and what was the past how it was called and who answered and why it all went down who were those heroes the kids have got to know of and believe in before they can believe that you or any other black man has anything to tell them what were the betrayals how does judas look when hes black detailed pictures of who and what is doing the killing now and how itawesome as it might seem can be maneuvered into deathtraps all the while youre singing about that woman that buddy those personal artpromises you made to yourself all and any of it placed right in the context in which you found it and from which you can only free it through direct confrontation that is americas ballcutting racist vise youve grabbed every piece of beauty thought insight and style youve ever achieved in your life while dodging that crap and to put it out of your work before it is out of your life is making a lie of your artwhich is nothing but your life thoughts feelings seeings imaginings doings sent out to others with an imposed reorder you will never have a theater an art a life really representative of the soulbeats and desirelines of you and your kind until you and your kind have come together and pooled desires plans resources and capabilities to throw olf the jailers the people the communities are trapped in both unconscious suicide and subtle dedicated genocide you have a tool that might be able to help whatre you going to do go out on a bridge halfway between realities and blow to yourself or serenade the downtown people and catch the pennies they throw at your feet i hope not speaking of penniesand we have tothere is also a definite practical economical reason for the new theater going physically to the black communities that is that broadway doesnt want your blackness wasnt designed or intended for it definitely doesnt want any strange new forms inspired by that very blackness she is a contented fat white cow if you can slip in and milk her for a minutewell then more blackpower to you brother but im telling youits a weird price shes asking she wants you to be a singing hyena dancing on the graves of yourself and everyone you know serious things dramas are things that come from some other country some other century and even then are best set in a madhouse and quote blackcomedy has nothing to do with afroamericans broadway cannot support you brothers and sisters it would be against their interests if youre thinking that offbroadway is a haven think again it is finally as a perfect example of what america would have its artists involved in a zoo with a carnival where the animals and the freaks play delightfully curiously shockingly with lights colors words forms gestures always with some ingrown aspect of themselves never with anything in the outerworld should any relevance be uttered or implied it is usually done so with the utmost obscurity now and again i have to admit something disturbs that tranquil scene down there something real and relevantrelated to other peoples livesseeps in then everyone does a doubletake and goes back wondering if maybe something could really be starting down there after all but its usually just something or someone healthy getting ready to breakout of there nothing to be alarmed about wont happen often to round off my thinking on offbroadway i tell you that art for arts sake is incest and the offsprings of that are usually strange and feeble we black people desperately need a healthy natural artform art coming from an intercourse with life our lives as we have and must live them in order for our art theater to provide this for us it must become an organic functioning part of our communities as black artists we must go home in every way go wherever it is we most feel indigenous and organic and therefore a natural observer and commentor it is there that our talents must pay dues and spend dividends the communities the people can sustain assist and inspire us to essential and brilliant levels in our new black theater our new visions but only if we assist and inspire them to the same levels in the new black theater of their living to new visions of their lives nearly everyone knows the story of old sam sam came out of harlem and he worked on the same job for years he was a hard worker but he always took mondays off one day the boss told him sam you are the best worker i have but why cant you get to work on mondays sam answered boss if you could get colored on friday nights and have as much fun as we do you couldnt get to work on mondays either now all of this is amusing but there is something to be noted here sam was in the same place where he was years ago and in looking around at the position of the black man in the theater i am wondering if he isnt in the same place he has been in for years and like sam he may be having fun on weekends but he is being insidiously destroyed it takes no genius to realize that a theater is as strong as its playwrights there has never been a truly great theater without playwrights the greeks had sophocles and aeschylus the british had shakespeare the french had moliere and the irish had synge and ocasey and the american theater of the s had oneill barry and sidney howard black people had fun sometimes i suspect that black people have had too much fun they have run their mouths while white folks were organizing no one has had the nerve to say it out loud but i suspect very strongly that one of the reasons the great african civilizations fell was because their intellectuals did more talking than writing and the children of those great civilizations continue to talk at any rate the realization that any theater needs playwrights led to my joining the late great actress rose mcclendon in organizing the negro peoples theater in two years later after miss mcclendons death my late wife muriel rahn joined me in establishing the rose mcclendon players we drew around us such talented people as ossie davis jane white ed cambridge austin briggshall frederick oneal dooley wilson canada lee george norford eugene grigsby fred carter and loften mitchell we initiated a policy of doing only plays written by black playwrights and we did pretty well five years were poured into our activities in the basement of the mt morris park library at west street we produced fifteen plays some oneactors some fulllength some were better than others but at least three showed truly great promise on the part of their authors unfortunately those three authors long ago ceased to write plays they became press agents reporters and school teachers for they had to eat and no one was buying a black playwrights work in those daysunless he turned out a green pastures harlem or some such trivia that appealed to broadways white theatergoers no one is buying black playwrights work today eitherincluding black producers indeed a curious thing has happened this past year while people sang of the negro theatergroundswell exactly one black american ronald milner saw his play produced in new york city the nowdestroyed new lafayette theater produced mr milners whos got his own black producers are outmarshaling the marshal plan they have produced the work of a european and now theyre going to australia and africato any place but home to put it bluntly black producers are allies of the power structure in terms of keeping black people in their customary roles namely court jesters in the american drama it seems that neither white nor black america wants to deal with the realities of the black experience on this continent frankly i began to worry when i saw those foundations giving out huge chunks of money i said then that those who got the money were going into a lot of mental gymnastics over how to keep black playwrights off the boards i kicked myself told myself i was getting old and that those fellows would produce plays by black americans well i am sorry that i was right in the first place someone wrote recently that the negro theater is a sometime thing it is and it will ever be thus unless somebody writes for it there are highsounding motives and mottoes around today indicating that black people are making their way in the theatertheir own way the new york times recently devoted nearly a full page of its sunday theater section to the pronouncements of douglas turner ward author of the fine longrunning double bill day of absence and happy ending at the st marks playhouse which is now the home of the newly founded and funded negro ensemble company any day you can pick up a daily and find a lengthy piece on the life and times of the negro theater these pronouncements all say pretty much the same thing that the afroamerican theater needs special playsplays that communicate to a special audience the black audience the premise is that it takes a black american to really write for the black american theater douglas turner ward said as much in his new york times interview some months ago to stanley kaufman former times theater critic obviously the ford foundation has no objections to this premise since it gave to mr ward and his partner actorproducer robert hooks nearly to form a negro ensemble company where black actors could be trained and molded into an ensemble theater group all of this is very good but i have a feeling that afroamerican playwrights should be working right along with actors directors and others in the group and i dont mean student actors and directors exclusively i mean professional afroamerican playwrights to write material for the professional actors in the company much is happening to black people everywhere today where are the playwrights to get some of this downthis black comedy or dramaand on our stages now what any novice in theater knows is that not all playwrights start out writing hits more often he misses before he hits but what is important is the opportunity to develop his craft right along with the actor if nobody ever presents his works he will never know his weaknesses he has to see his creations and find out for himself where he made mistakes he must go through the same trialanderror method which makes the actor outstanding in the process therefore of developing an afroamerican or negro ensemble company whose basics are not only communication with the black audience but communicating blackness to a white audience it is difficult to understand why black playwrights are not carried along in the overall development of the negro ensemble company true mr ward is a prolific writer and a solid pro but the scheduled plays for the negro ensemble companys first season suggests that mr ward and mr hooks are not only fresh out of plays but that they are fresh out of playwrights in the latter case this just isnt so the negro ensemble company has adapted ray lawlors summer of the seventeenth doll which had a fairtomiddling broadway run a few years ago to a negro locale on the levee gracious me this harks back to the thirties and forties of the hot mikado carmen jones and my dartin aida only now the nec is substituting legitimate plays for musicals after years of watching and participating in this kind of thing to earn a living i am not only disappointed in mr ward and mr hooks i am shocked no i am disgusted why anyone would think these gentlemen are a couple of starving black actors without a theater to their names hustling next weeks rent but that just isnt so these two guys are rich man theyve got nearly half a million bucks of the mans money and when thats gone im sure the man will be back with more well cry discrimination if he doesnt after all its popular to give black folks money these days its chic compounding the insult is the injury i endured by watching song of the lusitanian bogey by peter weiss who needs the nec to do his plays like he needs a hole in the head mr weiss whose marat sade and the investigation were weirdly successful after a fashion will probably come through in his usual style and please the critics this wont help negro playwrights and the announced daddy goodnessof which i know nothing will probably give black playwrights a chance to see what richard wright might have accomplished as a playwright had he lived of course mr wright didnt write daddy goodness he merely translated and adapted it why does the nec select these plays to do when there are many afroamerican playwrights walking around with pretty good scripts under their arms looking for producers i can think of at least four offhand in whom the nec could invest as playwrightsinresidence have a season of four plays that would say something to black and white people but especially to black people i shall name them without their permission they are alice childress who had a fine offbroadway play at the greenwich mews theatre some seasons back entitled trouble in mind loften mitchell who has just written the greatest book on the negro theatre ever published black drama and who had an excellent play at the greenwich mews a few seasons back entitled a land beyond the river ossie davis whose purlie victorious not only had a broadway run but was also made into a movie neither of which made him rich because of his content and william branch whose a wreath for udomo is a classic and telling statement of an african dictators downfall based on a novel by the noted african author peter abrahams all of these men and this woman have had successes but with no foundations to keep them flush mitchell and branch did receive guggenheim awards of each some years back and they came up with good works now that the nec has made its first big mistake i hope a second season will afford it an opportunity to go about the business of doing what it should have been doing from the very first nec does have the work of the noted african playwright wole soyinka on its schedule but i think it is ironic that the group had to look to european australian and african sources it is indeed so ironic that years later old sam and i remain in the same spot taking mondays off sam doesnt know it but i think i do while were having fun on those weekends the american power structure is taking care of business and its business is to see that we black people stay in the same place for another years black people are rapidly learning that they must define their own terms how terms are defined determines how events are judged and how questions are answered for instance in catholic schools the religious upheavals initiated by martin luthers dispute with the pope are called the protestant revolution whereas in public schools the same series of events are called the protestant reformation the term which you accept determines how you feel about the events discussed a term much in vogue for discussion nowadays is black theater there is a general agreement that there is a definite need for a strong and viable black theater in this country and as a result groups have been springing up through the country the recentlylaunched new yorkbased negro ensemble company is one group which lays claim to filling the void existing in the black theater world financed with a oneyear grant from the ultraestablishmentarian ford foundation the company has already completed one of the four plays which are scheduled for its first season at the time this is written the play song of the lusitanian bogey by german playwright peter weiss received generally favorable reviews from the press and many people hailed this as new black theater but to many interested persons the question remains is the negro ensemble company really black theater can a theater group financed by the ford foundation produce black theater in his recently published book crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruse provides a definition of black theater which most black people find acceptable my own standards for a black theater would be one where negroes themselves would finance the institution and man all the technical and administrative posts using this definition as a guideline the answer would have to be notrue black theater cannot be financed by this countrys ford foundations all critics of the company dont agree completely with mr cruses position of course they are not critical of the company for the acceptance of the grant but for the way it is being used by douglas turner ward the artistic director and robert hooks the executive director of the ensemble company actordirector ernie mcclintock says they have the money ford cant take it back the worst they can do is not renew it they could have used the oneyear grace to really experiment and give exposure to young black playwrights instead they are using all wellestablished playwrights who really dont need the exposure critics are especially incensed over the selection of plays for their first season besides weiss play which depicts the horrors of portuguese colonialism in africa the company is doing summer of the seventeenth doll by australian playwright ray lawler which has been transposed from its original australian setting to the world of migratory black sugar cane workers in louisiana the third play is kongis harvest the latest by nigerian playwright wole soyinka which deals with the corruption in i an african dictatorship and the final work is daddy goodness a richard wright adaptation of an original french play by louis sapin this play has to do with peoples need for a kind of messiah and the ways in which this need can be exploited critics feel that there is no excuse for the companys not scheduling one play by a black american playwright based on a black american theme ward answers these criticisms with the explanation that the companys objective is to promote plays which have a relevance to black life whether written by black or white american or foreign playwrights he contends that the selected plays fulfill that aim technically he is correct but the question still remains why does a group which lists as one of its aims a desire to provide a new platform for the exposure of the works of young black actors and playwrights not have one play by a young black playwright in its opening season the explanation that the directors of the company looked but couldnt find a suitable play is met with skepticism in the black artistic community a second bone of contention between the negro ensemble company and many of its potential supporters is its location in the east village rather than in one of the black communities especially since ward himself has been quoted as saying that for a negro playwright the need is for an audience of other negroes in his new york times article american theatre for whites only ward wrote of the need for a theater of permanence continuity and consistency providing the necessary homebase for the negro artist to launch a campaign to win his ignored brothers and sisters as constant witnesses to his endeavors he also wrote that the black playwright needed not necessarily an allblack audience to the exclusion of white but for the playwright a black audience is certainly his primary audience the first persons of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his interest and purpose be best perceived by others it would seem to follow that a playwright expressing such sentiments would locate his theater in one of the large black communities where the type of audiences which he described is readily available ward didnt do so and his reasoning is that were not here on the lower east side because its the lower east side were here because we got a threestory building complete with theater that fulfills our needs moreover we can be reached by negroes from all over the metropolitan area not just harlem bedfordstuyvesant is only minutes away and jersey city minutes we want to build a black audience throughout the area he also feels that black people will come to the st marks playhouse to see good relevant theater using the success of his oneact plays day of absence and happy ending in attracting an almost per cent black audience people as a case in point these statements hardly quiet his critics who wonder how many black people would attend the theatre if it was located in their community and they could just walk in from the streets pay their money and see good relevant theater the question remains can the term black theater be used to define a theater located outside the black community the negro ensemble company says yes its critics say no the companys use of whites in key positions has also brought it under fire from important segments of the black community gerald krone is administrative director paul mann is director of training for the professional company alfred geller is legal counsel and joseph m gottfried is accountant these are some of the whites who hold positions which many feel should have beenand could have beenheld by blacks the critics are especially soured by manns appointment as director of professional training feeling that this very sensitive post must be filled by a black director if the theater is directed towards a black audience wards reply to this line of criticism is that ive been a negro militant for years and i share their anger i also have my own ideas about practicality and they do not eliminate the use of any talent to fulfill any other talent well said but is he talking about black theater the negro ensemble company despite its claims is not black theater it may be interesting theater it may be good theater but to call it black theater would be considerably stretching the definition of black theater given by harold cruse a definition which i accept there is no consistent philosophy of cultural nationalism directing the actions of its leaders douglas turner ward and robert hooks who themselves are not known as cultural nationalists they are very talented and even their critics had little criticism of the caliber of the professional acting company about which it is generally agreed that the performances in bogey were excellent and in a highly professional ensemble style but those of us who are looking for a black theater will have to look elsewhere right into the black communities realizing that if we want true black theater we will have to pay for it and sustain it by our resources and skills recently i received in the mail a big fat bulky questionnaire from the committee on human rights concerning discrimination in the theater now that was bad enough but a few evenings later i went bouncing out of my apartment as i do every saturday night or early sunday morning to purchase the new york times hurried back to quickly glance through the newsy theater section and the intellectual magazine section to find out if there was anything interesting enough to read i could then determine whether i would stay in and relax or go to the movies i had just given up on the drama section i briskly began thumbing through the magazine section when what to my wandering eyes should appear but a big fat juicy article about us oh boy oh boy what a pleasant surprise out the window goes all plans for the movies i pour me a glass of milk take out cookies and make myself comfortable so i can really relax and enjoy what mr kerr has to say about us poor neglected problem children the negro actor well its about time i say but the more i read the less comfortable i become and the more i read the less cozy my apartment becomes and the more i read the more sour my milk becomes and the more rancid my cookies seem to taste until finally i scream being the method actress that i am stop stop stop oh please stop i cant take any more of this meaningless chitchat this wasted misdirected energy first the questionnaire and now this article that did it its just too too much for one week i mean really the white establishment is making it impossible for us to stay sane after the emotional outburst the irony of the whole ridiculous situation hit me and i simply plopped down in my not so cozy chair and laughed now by the time i had finished going through all my emotional changes the last feature of the movie had begun and there i was stuck at home with my article on one side and my questionnaire on the other what to do what to do what to dothe outlook is incurably blue in case you are curious as to the contents of my big fat bulky questionnaire and after all you are entitled to know what caused the initial discomfort it goes like this dear actor the enclosed questionnaire is confidential and is aimed towards determining what kind of employment situation exists for actors with racial andor ethnic minority backgrounds in order to explore conditions relating to the work experience of the professional actor and to find out if the hiring policies of theatrical employers are changing and what the rate of that change is we must have your cooperation in gathering information that will give us facts please read the questionnaire over carefully bear in mind that its purpose is to determine is there an employment problem in the theatrical field broadway offbroadway television motion pictures television commercials and industrials for qualified negro puerto rican japanese chinese indian etc actors need i go any further now i ask you is this questionnaire really necessary all one has to do is turn on the television go to any neighborhood movie or buy a ticket to any broadway play and the answers are readily available without the need for any questionnaire after all this time centuries and i do mean centuries how can whites still be naive enough to think that the racial inequalities of show business and on a larger scale of this country can be solved by writing still more articles essays questionnairesand even bookson the problem of the negro in america come now who are we kidding at this point in our history there are certainly enough books and periodicals both for and against integration most of which in their own individual styles clearly define the racial problems in america books which precisely state why all this happened how it happened why it continues to go on and even solutions to the problem and if one refuses to read books on this touchy subject one has the alternative of taking a trip that is those who are brave enough to any ghetto in any city of this country and see for yourself actually for all the friends of black people who constantly ask what do you want or in some cases if they are ultrasophisticated what do they want or why do they hate us so it wouldnt be a bad idea to sponsor guided tours once or twice a day through each harlem of this country heavily protected of course and if it accomplishes nothing else at least we might be able to eliminate those stupid questions my point is simply this there is no excuse any more for this childlike naivete concerning the racial issues in this country and on a more specific level in the theater black writers have more than done their share toward providing enlightenment if they would all leave their typewriters and not write another sentence for another decade there would still be enough material to read and digest the white american has proven himself over the vears to be the m most cunning calculating shrewd and contriving human ever created he spend hours upon hours every day mastering the ability to maintain andor gain power and will go to any lengths to achieve this power so how can he expect me to believe that the same mastermind who created the hydrogen bombs and send missiles into outer space this same brilliant mind cannot understand the simple issues involved in eradicating racial inequalities this shrewd mind instead expends vital creative energy trying to throw america offtrack by sending out banal questionnaires and writing juvenile articles concerning the negro question how mr kerr one of americas most outstanding theater critics could reach his conclusions in his article in the new york times magazine am a negro or am i an actor is absolutely mystifying to me does he really think after all this time actors are dumb enough to interpret this concern to mean he really wants to do something positive to eliminate the condition tm afraid not instead the article will be read and people will say isnt that a shame and again life will go on actually on the surface the article seemed intelligent terribly honest and extremely courageous it would appear that he has tremendous insight concerning the dilemma confronting black people in the american theater today he asked many legitimate questions which showed a total awareness of the existing situation however in the process of answering those very questions thereby arriving at definite conclusions and proposing definite solutions he left the negro actor either totally confused bewildered or completely disappointed relative to what he must do about increasing his employment opportunities on broadway lets look at the situation closely as stated up to this date integration has been the black actors total concern on broadway in order to provide more jobs for himself in the already established field of entertainment he has picketed satin marched and negotiated new laws this still has not helped him to accomplish his goals because he now finds himself in a position where he must turn down many of these very jobs so it would seem the problem is far more complex than simply hiring more negro actors now the question is what type of jobs can heor should heaccept perhaps the answer to this question should be as long as the white establishment is in complete control as long as it determines the interpretation of the roles as long as they dictate to us what the behavior of the character must be as long as they reap the majority of the material profit the black actor accepting roles in such vehicles will only help maintain the status quo andor in some cases even retard his already established position why when white people determine what image black people should reflect on stage they usually perpetuate out of ignorance antiquated cliches these writers and directors generally have no real knowledge of the true history and psyche of black people and therefore their creativeor historical choices of what the black actor is suppose to represent are inaccurate or unreal the black actor is therefore being used as a pawn for the whites own personal gain this is particularly true in musicals where we are most blatantly exploited always singing dancing carefree happygolucky got no worries got no cares creatures since contrary to what mr kerr says the theater does play a major role in setting standards and values the black artist who continues to accept these type roles will justify and also enablewhite writers to continue to write them and white producers to continue to make money from them and can you blame them and white audiences will continue to carry a distorted image back home with them as long as this prevails there will be no next step forward if producers writers anddirectors intentions were honorable when dealing with black material on or offbroadway they would at least solicit the services of black consultants andor assistant directors they would hire black personnel on an administrative or policymaking level and please dont raise the issue of qualifications today there exist many victims of the theater s fear of hiring qualified black personnel i am one such victim as one big producer said to another what is she going to be some kind of black thermostat it seems no one is willing to share his control even if it would mean a better more accurate production examples hallelujah baby on broadway and all regional and repertory theater companies lincoln center included how can there be progress as long as every decision made and every job obtained in the theater is from a white point of view and must be accepted on white terms no matter how big a black actor may become his image is still fixed lockedin and he is constantly used as some kind of oddity or bastard commodity as a black actress as long as this condition prevails i can merely look forward to playing demanding roles such as prostitute maid andor every now and then just for local color of course some form of exotic perhaps a role in one of the classics however if im really lucky and can survive the frustrations of this business when im old and gray i can look forward to playing a strong forceful ballcutting matriarch and the white theater will continue to profit from my unique negritude at least i will be secure in specifically knowing the types and roles i will or will not be allowed to play i will not be allowed to grow from an ingenue into a leading lady into a character actress heavens no thats for white folks only i will rather grow from a hard cold prostitute into a hard cold matriarch only two dimensions its really amazing to what lengths playwrights and directors go to in order to make their black characters fit the stereotype one could never imagine a black actress playing a woman or even a lady who is eitheror warm wise sensitive intelligent loving puritanical helpless longsuffering confused or perhaps a fickle human being consciously or unconsciously really its irrelevant white people have convinced themselves and as always when they convince themselves they usually convince most blacks too that being black of necessity narrows ones scope therefore being black means being limited its like putting on some form of strait jacket its some kind of freakish quality which in all theatrical cases necessitates that you be handicapped a basket case and it seems that as long as black performers are hired to entertain white america their creative talents will be dealt with in this extremely limited fashion actually all that being black means is that one has a specific frame of reference or point of view just as any white american russian irish english jewish greek spanish chinese or any other race of people have and isnt that where all creative experiences begin from a specific ethnic or environmental base blackness is something within not something without therefore being black merely gives the artist a specific base or starting point whereby he may relate his life experiences to an audience in his own unique life style to quote mr kerr we live in a time of theatrical naturalism for approximately years our plays have become more and more photographic more literally faithful to the details and appearance of life as it is lived statistically settings must look exactly as houses and apartments look behavior in the theater must duplicate precisely behavior outside the theater whether we call this realism or naturalism doesnt matter what matters is that we now expect to hear and see in the theater a close duplication of what we see and hear in our homes in our offices on our sidewalks whites do not see many negroes in their homes nor do negroes see whites in theirs not socially not as young brides not as reallife leading ladies whites do not see many negroes in their offices at least not after they have passed the reception desks general experience knows no casual interchange to place such a casual interchange upon the stage as though it were real when we know it is not iswithin naturalismto falsify nature the image doesnt persuade it kicks back therefore one can reach the conclusion that white audiences will not support an integrated play or an allnegro play which does not coincide with their way of life their way of thinking but the fact of the matter is that the united states is a mixed society it isnt a white society its a whiteandblack society this we can also both agree on now please let us not confuse the discomforts caused by sexual involvements with those of socalled casual interchange one has nothing to do with the other and perhaps we should leave the bedroom alone and begin thinking and using our energies toward developing a dialogue between blacks and whites which will enable us to have a more realistic picture as to how and where we do exist and how this knowledge can be used in the theater in essence anyone who doesnt come in at least casual contact with a black these days is an exception rather than the rule and he should immediately do something about his plight perhaps mr kerr was referring to people who occupy the orchestra seats on broadway they cause broadway to be as sterile and superficial as it is perhaps if broadway were geared toward the people we could have more realistic and meaingful theater this then seems to be the reason theater is in the predicament it is today broadway sticks to the status quo in order to appease these orchestra seaters with their rigid fantasized ethics perhaps this whole system of theater should be destroyed because in having to conform to this oversentimental highly romanticized view of life it is killing the artist this decadent sense of morality that insists on the clean proper and pure that refuses to face life directly and honestlyperhaps this very fear of truth is killing the american theater in the past the standards of achievement and excellence have been set by broadway and because of these rigid rules regulations prejudices and narrowminded concepts the state of the theater today is boring and depressing broadway with its machinelike precision has become the equivalent of a xerox machine it is a place where stage hands and technicians are treated with more deference than actors would the theater be in this position if it dared to deal with life as painful as it may be as it really exists this would include dealing with all its religious moral political and racial conflicts nowadays black and white writers who are striving to reach broadway audiences must be limited by this factor a writer should not be fenced in he should be able to direct his creative energy toward what he believes to be true he should be free to interpret life fully as he sees it and as all great playwrights before him have dealt with it he should not be forced to speak from two sides of his mouth the money side dont rock the boat please the orchestra and the true side and because of these same dominant values more often than not the negro actor sacrifices his ethnic heritage in order to become more salable ie commercial if he becomes more commercial it therefore follows he becomes more white can he actually merge and identify at the same time the black actor is the beneficiary of a rich cultural heritage and the day has got to come when he will be allowed to expose this image on every stage in the american theater in order to accomplish this he must constantly think of the race at large and not allow any white person for whatever reason to dictate to him or interpret for him what being negro means because white directors are very guilty of this i have a diary of such incidents and have lost several jobs because of this we are a race of people with a dual cultural heritage in the field of jazz and rhythmandblues our identity is clearly reflected we are american with an african ancestry what an exciting theatrical combination we should not have to choose which one of these combinations we wish to project one enhances the other its like meat and potatoes bread and butter greens and cornbread one makes the other taste better why should black performers have to conform to values which have so little meaning to them why should they give up something valuable and vital in their own backgrounds in order to fit in ideally all mr kerr and the audience should be concerned with is the talent and craftsmanship of the performer ability is all that should ever be in question was the actor believable if the answer is yes then the audience has understood the meaning of the word universal does it seem reasonable for black actors to give up their individuality the root of their own creative and artistic life in order to blend into or become the same as their fellow white performers if this were to happen the american theater would indeed lose an integral part of real reality contrary to what mr kerr believes the role of the actor seems to me to be that of creation if he can create he can therefore impersonate through the use of dialects costumes makeup and behavior pat terns none of which has to do with skin color let us not confuse impersonation with imitation because that is what in fact is being suggested here in television and movies the black actor has been required to be or has become an exact copy of the white actor in order to obtain jobs let this tragedy not happen in the theater because of the black actors burning desire to become a part of the existing broadway establishment with all its middle class values he has not been able to solicit or maintain a mass black audience he must fight typecasting where qualities and skin coloring take precedence over training ability experience and in some cases even talent he must fight the theory of nonprotest plays life is just a bowl of cherries plays romantic boy meeets girl boy marries girl they live happily ever after plays these situations are not reallife situations to black audiences and as long as we have no audience we will have no power white people support the theater because it is geared toward whites one of our jobs as black actors should then be to remedy this evil we must create an audience we must therefore feed our talent into the black ghettos even while we are still personally pursuing jobs on broadway in order initially to acquire this audience the black writer and actor should become a part of the black community it is impossible to support a blackoriented play without a black audience the producer writer director actor and technician should grow handinhand with this audience one cannot survive without the other when purlie victorious was produced on broadway the actors had to attend banquets dinners churches parties dances and benefits many times directly after their show each night in order to obtain an audience the extra stress and strain should not be placed on any actor black or white the big broadway shows simply use national television to promote ed sullivan tonight show today show merv griffin show etc the few black plays successfully produced either on or offbroadway have been supported under tremendous odds by black people day of absence happy ending raisin in the sun these producers had to fight to keep their shows open and they pridefully point to the fact that black people helped them do this but it seems only logical that if these same plays were produced by the same professional company in a black community they would triple the amount of black theatergoers thereby creating a power base again this has been proven in the music field but musicians have had a longer time to develop their craft and they have not sacrificed or lost their ethnic root in the process look at the apollo lines form around the block to see black entertainers this is something with which the audience can identify as well as enjoy and when a performer warrants international acclaim some clever white producer brings him downtown to philharmonic or carnegie hall it therefore seems at this point our best and most realistic hope is to go back home back to the black community and begin to build a new theater a theater that is not broadwayoriented a theater where you can call the shots as you see them and not be afraid of losing your job a theater where you will be free to experiment and to create a theater where you can relax and be colored colored in speech movement and behavior patterns a theater where you can stop denying and begin identifying then and only then will you be able to create a power base which will allow you to become selfassertive you will then build a following which will enable you to name your price on broadway perhaps this is a form of separation not segregation but as of now i see no other alternative in a short run it will seem to delay the day but in a long run it will most definitely save it save it for the theater and for the generations to come dont worry when you build this theater white people will come in droves by subway foot bus car and even by chauffeurdriven limousine standing first in line to buy tickets theyre smart that way playwrights in dark glasses een who was res ir t sponsible for the na ii k t ona oallery of art f in washington d c was told by his wife when they were vacationing in cannes to take their eight year old daughter down to the mediterranean to swim so he did the child put one foot in the water and ran to her father saying its cold duveen said sit down stay here ill be back when he returned he was carrying a small pot of boiling water his child watched him pour it into the sea and she stepped in without a murmur i recall another story about august strindberg the great swedish playwright when his grandson climbed into his lap and said spontaneously grandfather can god see in the dark he replied quietly no but your grandfather can the incident of the little girl stepping into the sea and the questions of the little boy are part of the answer to the use and the function of all the arts it is difficult to say what the arts are any of the artsdrama dance poetry architecture painting and sculpture in the words of edna st vincent millay it is like trying to define the colors of sunset to a friend bom blind the artist can help us to survive in a confused neurotic wicked and undefined world by pouring warm water into the cold sea he can look into the dark recesses of our hearts and help us understand what we are and why we are he can also hold up ideals of comic laughter and of human suffering to aid us in better understanding our fellow men he also knows that through the ages nothing has changed only the shadows and the sunshine are in different places there can be a common definition of what art is and especially drama since it embraces all of the arts what do shakespeare langston hughes mies van der rohe chekhov picasso el greco the great cathedral of santa sophia richmond barthe duse miles page billie holiday charlie chaplin michaelangelo sidney poitier martha graham james baldwin and even walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs have in common perhaps robert edmund jones the scenic designer encompassed it when he said you get an idea you set it down and it is there forever this might be one of the keys to unlock the magic and the wonder of artistic creation universality is another although each creation in any of the arts must have a local habitation and a home it must also be universal i remember reading that an actress from abroad came to new york and the first thing she wanted to see was lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun her friend asked her what did you think of it did you understand it the actress replied why of course women everywhere especially mothers strive to fulfill the good life for their children or for their friends a sense of insecurity is necessary for all artists when they become fat in mind pompous in spirit and repetitive in language and creation they become like gogols dead souls w h auden put it in a succinct way towards the end of his poem the flight into egypt safe in egypt we shall sigh for lost insecuritv only when her terrors come does our flesh feel quite at home richard wright for example wrote in native son black boy and uncle toms children of the terror the hurt the crushed spirits and the laughter through tears of the negros state of being in this country when he became rich and famous he fled to paris and stayed there his life was peaceful unannoyed unmississippi and his writing became that too even so the play native son is now dated because of the blatant propagandists theme and projection inevitability which means that there can be no other way to do what the artist wants to do is another key the seal of his imaginative characterizations cannot be erased in any way james baldwin in amen corner has created human beings who are truthful because their road to success or ruin cannot be altered in any way they act as they must they speak and feel as they must there is no artificiality that tolling hill of truth gongs throughout this tortured and moving world of the storefront church juxtaposition must always be present in some of the best and feeblest plays of langston hughes he never forgot that laughter sorrow and tragedy go side by side in simply heavenly for example there is simples hilarious speech of what he would do if he were in command of a white regiment of soldiers from the deep south throughout this long speech we laugh with the laughter of understanding afterwards we know that mr hughes has dug the knife deep into the conscience of white america and struck that tolling bell for negroes with dead souls but who survive because they understand the ridiculousness of their position in we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal suggestiveness no playwright ever tells all but leaves a great deal to the imagination of the audience so that they as audience can interpret and participate there was a boy in the navy who was darker than eggplant but very handsome whenever he had to go to the town he went through alleys and bypassed crowds because he thought they would laugh at him i slipped a note under his door which said im so black they call me night time when i walk along everyone looks for stars after that he strolled along the wide sidewalks of chicago with a kind of humble and beautiful pride the point is made when clifford odets has one of the women in paradise lost say if i had a child id give it toys of gold to play with these are just some of the few elements that all works of art must have if they are to survive beyond their time one of the things that is difficult for any minority group and especially its artists to understand is that they are not alone in their suffering that from the sores of job to the weeping mothers whose sons die in vietnam and the terrible torture to the hearts of the people whose children died in the bombed church in birmingham there is a symbolism of the tie between time ago time now and time ahead most of the negro playwrights seem to think that the suffering of negroes is only the suffering of negroes and although in shakespeares words they give this suffering their own local habitation and a home they are hardly giving it a universality that will command artistic distinction and lasting power leroi jones certainly has daring ironic thrust and shocking power however he has none of the qualities listed above in his play the toilet he is saying that the world is a toilet and that the flushing of the urinals and seats is the flushing he is trying to give to a sordid world the total of his works so far except the baptism has the disgusting quality that he means it to have in dutchman he goes far beyond bounds of any artistic law to shock and disgrace an audience into his way of thinking his use of four letter words in these plays seem to be put in to make life as real as he thinks it is playwrights with winning and timeless power have been able to create the same atmosphere that jones wishes to create with their special language that conjures up our imagination because we have not heard these things before in shakespeares hamlet hamlet says of his stepfather remorseless lecherous treacherous kindless villain o vengeance instead of saying as leroi jones might say my stepfather is full of shit sean ocasey has created characters who have experienced all the tortures of hell and who have never seen the face of god their anger and their anguish holds our attention through the rightness of their language which reflects not only their hearts but their souls mrs boyle after her son has been killed in a local bloody revolution in dublin ireland says to her daughter what was the pain i suffered johnny bringing you into the world to carry you to your cradle to the pains ill suffer carryin you out o the world to bring you to your grave mother o god mother o god have pity on us all blessed virgin where were you when me darlin son was riddled with bullets when me darlin son was riddled with bullets sacred heart o jesus take away our hearts o stone and give us hearts o flesh take away this murderin hate an give us thine own eternal love jean genets the blacks uses music flaring tempers anger poetry and the dance without losing his essential theme black versus white he is daring and provocative he may break wind in our faces but like the greek playwright aristophanes his satire and his apparently amused state of our world shames us while also being a work of art james baldwin wrote a confused and eloquent play in blues for mister charlie it is not a very good one but sometimes goes in the direction of the great greek drama as in that speech of lyle the white murderer who bends over the dead body of richard saying and may every nigger like this nigger end like this nigget face down in the weeds juanita during the trial says with force and greek passion i dont want to be gods mother he can have his icy snowwhite heaven if he is somewhere around this fearful planet if i ever see him i will spit in his face in gods face how dare he presume to judge a living soul a living soul mama is afraid im pregnant mama is afraid of so much im not afraid i hope im pregnant i hope i am one more illegitimate black babythats right you jive mothers and i am going to raise my baby to be a man a man you dig oh let me be pregnant let me be pregnant dont let it all be gone a man juanita a man oh my god there are no more for me did this happen to mama sometime who vanished like smoke and left her to get through this world as best she could is that why she married my father did this happen to mother henry is this how we all get to be mothersso soon of helpless menbecause all the other men perish no no no no what is this world like i will end up taking care of some man some day help me do it with love pete meridian parnell we have been the mothers for them all it must be dreadful to be parnell there is no flesh he can touch all of it is bloody incest everywhere haha youre going crazy juanita oh lord dont let me go mad let me be pregnant let me be pregnant so many of our negro playwrights are so saturated with the idea of negro oppression which of course they should be that they have left out the lasting power the universality of their art they just keep trampin they arent trying to make heaven their home they seem to prefer infernos to the blaze of light that can come in the future many of them have discipline like lofton mitchell and william branch but they hardly have the daring or the flair to infuse high vision with our present angry condition at the end of an opera written for the centennial of howard university the wife of medgar evers sings they think theyve bitten our tongues out cried out our eyes warped out our nerves and left us crippled in this searching sun to rot and wash our dry faces in the dust of their shame they are wrong we will bury you my joe so many thousand strong and from your grave the flowers of freedom will grow with iron strength oh my boy remember they are wrong we will bury you my joe so many thousand strong and from your grave the flowers of freedom will grow with iron strength oh my love remember your father remember us all and tear the teeth that bite you everywhere you roam remember your father went out to meet the foe n almost every country there have been playwrights who have written of and about their times in terms of their ethnic group the best of them have survived and will survive because the conditions about which they write have been set down in terms we may all understand without losing the healing and blessed presence of artistic values the healing and blessed presence of artistic values the flame that died the untimely death of otis redding marks a tragic and immeasurable loss to modern blues music otis played a historic role in reviving the feeling of the traditional blues and reinterpreting them for todays generation in a sense his sounds were a vital link between the music of the old traditional black communities of the rural south and the more recent rapidly growing black ghettos of the north and west in order to fully understand the significance of otis contribution to modern music it is necessary to briefly review the status of the blues over the past few decades although the traditional country blues provided the base for rhythm and blues jazz rock and roll and other dominant music forms today during the fifties and sixties they had begun to lose their influence except for the persistent popularity of only the most widely known blues singers each as b b king and muddy waters the popularity of traditional blues music as a whole was losing ground especially in the northern urban areas as more and more black people migrated from the rural south to the big cities further north they became more urbanized more americanized this influenced their music in that they became more concerned with refining the beat of their songs pronouncing the words of songs correctly and omitting the groans shouts and slurring of words of the blues the decline in the popularity of the blues became so great that several older blues artists such as memphis slim and sonny boy williamson left this country to live or work in europe they maintained that the people here no longer appreciate the blues the problem however was not simply a loss in appreciation for the blues it was also the fact that the older blues artists represented an older generation and their music was not completely in tune to changing times and conditions what was needed was a young blues singer who could adapt the soul of the traditional blues to the feelings and experiences of the younger generation the man whose historical destiny was to fulfill this need was none other than otis reddingalso known as the big o and the mad man from macon otis first hit recording these arms of mine was deep in the tradition of the country blues in fact when it first came out many people thought it was performed by one of the older less recognized blues singers of the south by a singer about or years of age but at that time otis was only years old and had just begun to develop as an artist the genius of otis redding was evident from his first recording but perhaps one of the best examples of his genius and versatility is contained in his second album the great otis redding sings soul ballads in otis first album there still are traces of his early influence little richard but by his second album otis is completely himself in the second album otis not only did soulful blues sides which he had helped to compose such as chained and bound come to me and mr pitiful he also did some ballads which had been made popular by other artists for your precious love its too late and a woman a lover and a friend otis did not imitate these ballads in the fashion of the artists who made them but reworked them giving them a fresh blues orientation and often surpassing the efforts of the previous artists the essential differences was the unique blues voice of otis together with his instinctive ability to sing directly from the heart otis natural voice enabled him to do what most other singers could not do he could use slurring words grunts groans and shouts to produce the sweetest of music also he was especially creative in making music out of special sounds unique to his manner of improvisation those distinctive otis sounds such as nanananana ou we ni and fafafafafa but otis did not rely upon his voice alone he was a perfectionist in blending the unique quality of his voice with the singing quality of the horns and the rhumba blues beat of the rhythm section his songs in person and recordings are distinguished by the fact that the instrumental background never clutters or works against his voice the two consistently come off really smooth the sound of the big o reached its peak in the years his own songsive been loving you too long respect fafafafafa good to methose he reworked such as satisfaction and try a little tendernessand those he did with carla thomastramp and knock on woodwere just a few of those which gained him international fame there is no question that otis deserved the title king of soul for he was the primary force behind the worldwide recognition and popularity of soul music today and his artistry is one of the best examples of the soul sound as his music indicates otis was an integral part of the profoundly spiritual culture of the black south it was the black communities of the deep south which produced and nurtured him and it was to these communities that he continually returned as the primary source of inspiration for his music and lifes work w e b du bois description of the spiritual qualities of black culture in his book gift o f black folk is also an apt description of the music of otis redding for after all the two are really the same as du bois said of black culture it is hard to define or characterize it a certain joyousness a sensuous tropical love of life a slow and dreamful conception of the universe an intense sensitiveness to spiritual valuesall these things and others like to them tell of the impact of africa on europe in america otis appreciation of these deep spiritual values of his roots provided the power behind his artistry and personality fully aware that the blues emanated from the people he was truly a poet of the people who sung for the masses and not just for the socalled cultured and sophisticated sets it is now well known how the titles and themes of his songs always reflected the elemental emotions and aspirations of the massessecurity respect just one more day good to me moreover otis always sought to keep the form of his songs at a level where they would remain meaningful to the people in an interview in soul magazine he stated basically i like any music that remains simple and i feel this is the formula that makes soul music successful when any music form becomes cluttered andor complicated you lose the average listeners ear there is nothing more beautiful than a simple blues tune there is beauty in simplicity whether you are talking about architecture art or music in effect otis whole life reflects his genius for recognizing beauty in simplicity he developed the natural gifts inherent in the crude and obscure elements of his lowly country background to become an artist of the highest caliber and of international repute as was brought out in the testimonials given at his funeral otis was a natural prince who sat with those of the highest status in world society but he never lost the common touch and never forgot his family friends and people wilford coates a member of otis personal staff said of the building that housed the offices of otis redding enterprises this building used to be a chicken produce house they cleaned the chickens in the basement and sold them upstairs youd never know it now everything otis touched turned beautiful coming up in a time when the black man is on the rise and coming into his own otis further recog nized that his creativity need not be limited to singing alone he also established successful firms for publishing music and managing young singers and he had developed into an accomplished recording producer outside the field of music he had an honest interest in helping black youth according to his lawyer he had given many scholarships to black students about which the public knew nothing he did these things purely out of his dedication to youth without seeking publicity or reward one of the special projects he was working on at the time of his death was the construction of a summer camp for underprivileged youth from the urban slums and ghettos otis death was so untimely and unexpected that it is nearly impossible to adjust to it at the time of his death he had just recuperated from a minor throat ailment and was beginning to build upon his newly recognized position as the king of soul music he understood the times he lived in and was doing the things he wanted to do for life no one expected his reign to be so brief the only way in which i can reconcile the shock and untimeliness of his death is to repeat a quote that was used to explain the early death of malcolm_x the candle light that burns the brightest dies out the quickest no light in modern music especially the blues burned brighter than that of otis redding we are blessed to have had him around as long as we did for langston hughes and stella holt in at one of those perennial writers g conferences the brilliant arna bontemps told the story of old sis goose she was swimming on a lake and a sheriff appeared and ordered her off the lake the sheriff was a fox and old sis goose snapped that she had a right to swim on the lake the sheriff arrested her and when they got to the jailhouse old sis goose looked up and saw the jailkeeper was a fox too when her case got to trial old sis goose looked around and saw that the prosecuting attorney was a fox her own lawyer was a fox and the court clerk was a fox the judge himself was a fox and when the jury appeared every member of it was a fox sis goose shook her head and said i aint got long to stay here i borrowed mr bontemps yarn on february it was on the occasion that marked the refurbished greenwich mews theater being dedicated to the memory of langston hughes and stella holt that date also would have been the sixtyseventh birthday of the great langston hughes it was an altogether fitting gesture on the part of the village presbyterian church and brotherhood synogogue sponsors of the greenwich mews theater which is housed in the basement of the building at west th street in new york city this theater under stella holts leadership had introduced several black playwrights to the downtown area and it has consistently produced the plays of the late mr hughes ttiere was considerable discussion after mr hughes death about a drive being led by stella holt to name the theater the langston hughes theater when stella followed langston to the grave there was talk too of naming the institution the langston hughesstella holt theater then there was a hue and a cry from righteous souls that the langston hughes theater should be housed in harlem no one bothered to note that negroes belong in greenwich village as much as they do in harlem no one bothered to remember that in when new york city was a dutch outpost known as new amsterdam african slaves were imported tfiey were housed on the fringe of what is now the bowery these africans built a wagon road to the upper part of the settlementto a place the dutch called haarlem then spelled with two as eighteen years later with the support of the rankandfile white colonists the africans petitioned the dutch for freedom received it and settled in a swampland which they built into a prosperous community that community is today known as greenwich village indeed the first negro theater known to this country existed in greenwich village this was the african grove theater housed at bleecker and grove streets this group performed shakespearean plays in the year the group was spearheaded by james hewlett and it had a great influence on actor ira aldridge the destruction of the african grove by white hoodlums had a marked influence upon mr aldridges career he realized then that america offered little hope to black actors and he sailed for europe where he was acclaimed by royalty it was indeed senseless to suggest that the langston hughes theater should not be housed in greenwich village at any rate the church and the synagogue leaders settled the entire matter when they decided to keep the name greenwich mews and dedicate the theater to mr hughes and miss holt the hit show running there at the time consists of two oneacters by the african playwright wole soyinka directed by cynthia belgrave and produced in association with miss belgraves husband kenneth farris that offering was suspended for the evening and those who appeared at the dedication stepped first into the theater lobby where a handsome plaque was placed on the lobby wall here too stood a picture of mr hughes and miss holt the curtain was down in the refurbished theater and there was a heavy silence about the place a silence of respect admiration and love the audience then went upstairs to the church this church since has been unique in religious terms for that year dr jesse w stitt the presbyterian minister and rabbi irving block joined forces and organized what is now known as the village presbyterian church and the brotherhood synagogue dr stitt spoke of stella holts efforts in the nineteenfifties to persuade him to permit the founding of the greenwich mews theater rabbi block also spoke others on the program were actress miriam colon raoul abdul who had worked closely with mr hughes and maxwell t cohen who had been a lawyer for both mr hughes and miss holt for the second half of the program there was a performance of jericho jimcrow featuring gilbert price joseph attles hilda harris dorothy drake rosalie king barney hodges and the hugh porter gospel singers the story about old sis goose was told because i felt both langston hughes and stella holt knew the meaning of that story i think that is why they were honored in that theater they both loved so much and i think that is why too both of them made worthy contributions to our culture the easiest thing in the world to do and the quickest way to success is to cut down a man of color the examples are numerous that filthy war in asia where men of color are being killed needlessly that filthy nation known as the republic of south africa which is supported by the american empire and that filthy situation in rhodesia the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color immediately comes to mind such names as denmark vesey paul robeson patrice lumumba malcolm_x ben bella nkrumah muhammad ali richard wright and langston hughes and stella holt the custom is with us today and anyone who doesnt believe me should work for one day in the city of new york department of social services or in the antipoverty program in fact cutting down a black man has become so fashionable that black people are getting in on the act look at what james baldwin did to richard wright with his alas poor richard look at what saunders redding did to julian mayfield and countless other black writers look at the daily insults that add to the weight of a writers years when people consistently ask why dont you write this kind of stuff or that kind of stuff why arent you rich with all the stuff you put out would you write this for me on speculation would you give me a free autographed copy of your book the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color langston hughes and stella holt never played that game they were beautiful people and they paid dearly for their beauty i first met langston hughes when i was a boy in harlem clubleaders andrew burris glenn carrington and zell ingram introduced me to his work which i loved later actordirectorproducer dick campbell invited me to ioin his rose mcclendon playersa group he had built in memory of that great black actress i joined mr campbells group and worked in his shows and he introduced me to people i had read about for years one night i went with him and his late wife muriel rahn to see a play by langston hughes called dont you want to be free it was presented at west th street in almost the same spot that now houses the offices of state senator basil paterson and the new york courier the leading role was played by robert earl jones and later by albert grant the work itself was the forerunner of mr hughes jericho jimcrow that night i first met langston hughes he shook my hand and he stood there that eternal cigarette dangling from his lips and i stood there openmouthed and overwhelmed i did not see him again for many years college naval service and endless travel kept us apart in the early s actors maxwell glanville and julian mayfield produced ossie davis first play alice in wonder ruby dee starred in the play and i was its associate producer when we presented it at the elks community theater i met mr hughes again we went into a scene he insisted upon paying his way into the theater and i insisted that he not pay it was our honor to have him there he told me ive got to help the group in some way and he placed a bill on the table and entered the theater later we met at various gatherings and talked about writing he was particularly fond of my two sons tommy and melvin and he used to send them his books when they were published our paths crossed again in the greenwich mews theater had optioned his play simply heavenly but for some reason the work couldnt be done in that theater i believe some influential people in top positions objected to the fact that much of the play was set in a bar there is always some reason for not doing a play by a black playwright he doesnt have enough teeth or he didnt have the work properly typed or the season isnt right or some such nonsense the same kind of excuses are given for not having a black quarterback playing professional football allamerican sandy stephens couldnt really throw or he liked to run too much with the ball or hank washington needs seasoning and theyll probably find out that the great jimmy raye is too short too tall or too something or other anyway simply heavenly could not be done at the mews while plans were being made to present it in another theater i completed the play that came to be known as a land beyond the river fellow playwright david timmons invited me to his house to read the script mr timmons had no heat in his house and i told him that while i am a northern boy who loves cold weather i do not like it indoors mr timmons then suggested that i meet him at the home of stella holt i did just that and i read my play in the presence of frances drucker stella holt and david timmons stella promptly grabbed the script and said she was going to produce it at the mews andif the mews directors didnt like it she was going to produce the play on her own and she went into motion and when stella holt went into motion she went into motion in fact david timmons and i once labelled stella and fran the special delivery girls well stella delivered a land beyond the river and michael howard who had been scheduled to direct simply heavenly found himself directing my play and dont you know langston hughes was ecstatic because my play was being done he was a big big man he had been out there alone for many many years he never wanted to be the only black writer he created an atmosphere a climate among black writersa brotherhood if an assignment came up hed look into it and pass it on to one of us and we do this today many a time william branch or alice childress or john killens have done much like langston and passed on writing assignments to me often at critical times in the early s i was having a very difficult time langston suggested that i do special research for a book he wanted to write about gypsies he got quite an advance and we signed contracts we kept meeting and talking about writing the book but we never got to do it he called me before he went to california to make a speech and said that when he got back we would definitely get around to writing the book i never saw him again when he returned from california he was stricken and he died a special memorial service was held in the harlem area for langston hughes i telephoned his agent to notify him he said i guess youre going to have to write that gypsy book alone i said that i would he then told me i should be able to get another advance for the publisher had deducted my advance from one of langstons other books when my wife marjorie came home i told her about it and tears came to both our eyes marjorie said he never told you he never told me he was a big big man with a big big heart he was a black man and they cut him to pieces they hacked him he wrote better than hollywood and broadway combined not to mention television but they didnt call on him to write those million dollar lechnicolored movies and make in his words moneys mammy langston once said that gershwin wrote porgy and bess from a downtown penthouse looking at harlem while the duke was riding the a train no they gave him fame but little fortune they didnt want him to earn a decent living and i know why the last thing the american empire wants is cultural equality it does not want to know the truth of the black experience and so its foundations will give lots of money to groups but those groups are not doing the plays of william branch alice childress ossie davis louis peterson theodore ward leroi jones clifford masonall recognized authors the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color and so they cut down langston hughes they allowed him to live long enough to have his intelligence insulted when they offered hallelujah baby instead of goodmorning daddy a hurry sundown instead of a hurried sunrise tired blood when we need youngblood they give us a guess whos coming to dinner when we know who has been starving us for years they will give us anything but justice i first met stella holt in the s when she served as business manager for the greenwich mews theater she impressed me immediately not only for her theatrical vision but also because of her love for humanity she became my beloved friend and after the produc tion of a land beyond the river i made a point of visiting her every time i had completed a new work i always read it to her and to frances drucker and both were always effervescent she and fran came out on a cold rainy day in may to see a special performance of my tell pharaoh and stella immediately went to work trying to have it presented throughout the new york city public school system it was when i visited her to read my new musical ballad of a blackbird that she mentioned that langston called her nightly his calls meant a great deal to her i refused to call stella after langston died i just didnt have the nerve to call her yet i knew i had to call i kept postponing it then finally i clenched my teeth and called she was very ill and the grief in her voice ripped at my ears and jarred me she said she simply couldnt believe that langston had really died no she said he is not dead she went on to say that she and fran were going to the country but she wanted marjorie and me to visit them i promised that we would after all i had to give her a copy of my book black drama to which she and langston contributed so very much i never gave her the book for i never saw her again i was sitting at my typewriter one day when the telephone rang it was stellas brotherinlaw and when he identified himself i cried out oh no there it was my other beautiful friend who had produced plays who had journeyed to harlem one time and arranged a special showing of my play the cellarmy friend who had taken on a land beyond the river before i could get it out of my typewriterhad joined my other beautiful friend and hers this stella holt who like dick campbell produced more works by black playwrights than anyone else i know of in new york city had departed this life stella and langston langston and stella what can i write of them in this society of the foxes this society which is built on cutting down men of color i can only say that i challenge this system to the teeth and i am someday going just like those friends of mine fighting all the way i can go bravely too because the divine creator blessed me by allowing me to walk beside two beautiful people todays black actors are portraying roles beyond their reach years ago and proving that a mans race is no measure of theatrical talent a little black boy born in lower manhattan years before the american civil war became a fleshandblood monument to the same cause under even more trying circumstances in august memorial societies and theaters in the united states and other parts of the world commemorated the onehundredth anniversary of the death of ira frederick aldridge pioneer who won admiration in almost every european country in the middle of the nineteenth century for his shakespearean performances aldridge acclaimed as a genius and one of the most precise interpreters of shakespeare of all time was the first black man to play leading white characters including lear shylock and macbeth for his stage triumphs he received many honorsamong them the medal for art and science from frederick iv of prussia the cross of leopold from the emperor of russia and the maltese cross in switzerland in the republic of haiti awarded him a commission in the army of haiti in the seventeenth regiment of the grenadier guards of the president of the republic franz joseph emperor of austria presented him with the medal of ferdinand he was made a brother mason of the grand lodge of ireland in at that time the prussian gold medal had been awarded only to german naturalist baron von humbolt italian composer gasparo spontini and franz liszt but this was not aldridges most important official recognition in the royal family of england made him a member of the royal saxon house order aldridge capping all earlier successes had become the first member of his race to be knighted throughout his life he often referred to himself as chevalier ira aldridge knight of saxony as is often the case time and scant information have caused a great deal of legend and fantasy to become interwoven with the facts of aldridges life ira aldridge was born in new york on july although he is claimed by senegal west africa and bel air in harford county maryland this date is supported by several official documents including his death certificate it has been theorized that iras father daniel aldridge who died september in new york was brought to america as a slave but it is more likely that daniels father came to this country in bondage and dubbed aldridge after his master iras mother lurona died while he was still a child daniel aldridge intended his son for a career in the ministry but the youth had already made up his mind about his lifes workhe wanted to be an actor as a student at the african free school in new york ira won prizes in speaking this sign that he had talent to be developed turned the boys love for the theater into a passion dramatic performances available to a black performer in the early s were very limited ira must have saved his pennies to see the shows the way modem youngsters use their allowances to see motion pictures on saturdays mystery swirls around the details but the aspiring actor probably made his first stage appearance at browns theater in new york which opened in at a time when james hewlett was the star attraction later he attempted the role of romeo after a taste of success the young black actor must have realized that the united states offered him little chance to advance in his craft and he decided to emigrate to europe james and henry wallack actors of that period befriended aldridge and when james boarded a ship for liverpool ira shipped as a steward on the same vessel the rumor persisted throughout aldridges career that he had been wallacks personal attendant aldridge arrived in england in and he may have studied for a time at glasgow university britain was in the process of abolishing slavery in its colonies and sympathy for blacks was strong feelings ran high and aldridge used this to his advantage with wallacks backing and a favorable social situation he made his first appearances at either the royalty or coburg theaters in london in october he began his first engagement with top billing at the coburg after playing to packed houses his performances were extended for four weeks aldridge used the title mr keene tragedian of colour early in his career an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame of edmund kean a wellknown contemporary actor later he became known as the african roscius after the roman actor quintus roscius gallus who lived before the birth of christ aldridge always demonstrated a flair for publicity and it is possible he gave himself this name the african roscius claimed his ancestors were african princes but this too may have been a romantic story he devised after his successful london engagement aldridge toured the provinces for several years treating the time as an apprenticeship he studied hard and refined his techniques later he traveled deep into russia bringing the works of shakespeare for the first time to remote towns and villages during these performances he often spoke his lines in english while the rest of the cast used their native tongues aldridge adopted england as his homeland and was granted british citizenship in november he married twice and had two sons and two daughters after touring russia and the continent for the last few years of his life aldridge died august in lodz poland apparently of a lung ailment that had plagued him for some time two days later he was buried in the evangelical cemetery there his tombstone a large cross was erected in there are memorial chairs in the shakespeare memorial theater at stratforduponavon in the fourth row of stalls is one with a bronze plate that tells it is dedicated to ira aldridge the african roscius is at last among his peers the brothers and sisters had been swaying to night train and grinding to harlem nocturne which sets the time as the early s in a black night spot in newark the band leader lynn was blowing hard the congregation screamed urged him on he started marching across the stage the sidemen joined and then off the stage and into the crowd that filled the graham their heads bad they moved near the back of the hall chanting and swaying and passed right in front of me writes leroi jones who fell in line behind the last wild horn man strutting like the rest of them everyone joined in the march around the hall but their energy would not be contained five or six hundred hoppedup woogies tumbled out into belmont avenue defying sunday night traffic narrator jones reflects we screamed and screamed at the clear image of ourselves as we should always be ecstatic completed involved in a secret communal expression it would be the form of the sweetest revolution to hucklebuck into the fallen capital and let the oppressors lindy hop out we marched all the way to spruce weaving among the stalled cars laughing at the dazed white men who sat behind the wheels the book is tales grove press and includes of them the best of whichas in the screamers abovecelebrates the truly black experience perhaps better than has yet been accomplished in the world of letters leroi jones in these mostly autobiographical works depicts black life as he saw it indeed lived it never sacrificing authenticity in favor of white readers understanding the clear image of ourselves as we should always be is a recurring and never dully stated theme of jones last few years labor with much poignancy he gives evidence of a mature understanding of the black lifestyle and in these tales as in his essaysthere is an omnipresent insistence that the power of black people is found in their lifestyle jones commands to be heard we are the zigzags of our own design is it secret are they walking the streets each night with hands in their pockets to see god the question burns and one knows immediately that the answer is not found in the very white sociology of the harvard irishman it was jones yearning as he puts it for any further separation from where my good grades were sure to lead that led him to the graham that same yearning led him also to the point where he couldnt walk stupid or unfeeling or in hip germany forever it was my own life i looked at it watched it in other peoples eyes it was nothing to me but real an extraordinary craftsman probably more genius than we dare admit jones has emerged not as americas leading negro writer but rather as her most formidable black artist because he has not turned his back on that energy which is black and which in this land makes black and white diverse and diametrically opposed he recognized that energy and rooted his work in it and only the wild and very poor thrived in grahams or could be roused by lynns histories and rhythms he writes but others have not merely failed to recognize that energyits powerbut would disclaim it america had choked the rest who could sit still for hours under popular songs or be readied for citizenship by slightly bohemian social workers writing about his childhood the short skinny boy with the bubble eyes his military days hitched like a common fool to the air force of the united states or a fantasy about the day after the crackers were defeated this ol cat me an pinball recognized still had a fag thing going for him in a fur coat he was some kind of magistrate bobby and moosie were questioning him about some silver he was supposed to have stashed he was a silver freak the dude was actually weeping crying big sobs the women crowded away from him i guess they really couldnt feel sorry for him because he was crying about money jones always excites one with his ability to communicate motion and his wit compliments his anger which brings to mind something he said before a chicago audience a little over a year ago after years yall still checking the cracker out or at fisk university six months later vietnam is simply whiteys greatest work of art jones laughs at a stupid world and he could have chosen to take some of its more valued prizes a tale called new spirit reveals a humility as rare as his arrogance it is a painfully personal undertaking about a young girl who died who was his lover filled with haunting honestyall the more haunting if you dug the young girls speed and jive one morning in newark for just a few minutes and thought her unusually kind and remember that you were a mite confused by the presence of the young girl and the other woman who were like sisters and who spoke lovingly of roi leroi jones doubtless is a man obsessed with a need to share all that is his life in these tales he does exactly that with a perfect dignity meanwhile he is placed on trial in the wilderness of new jersey for something or other while in the country of his birth the president lacks even imperfect dignity while calling for a national day of prayer who is the enemy but jones can write the shapes in the darkness had histories falling out of windows failing to become mayor of their mothers universes we must work together put on the right brightness stop killing each other wheel to face the actual killers i wanted to do this and wheel and wheel and wheel and be and couldnt monkees walked on my fingers people misunderstood is there a more painful truth in our day any daydavid llorens begin with there v i is reason to hope i that the long famine of kztdesa significant theater in the black communities of america is nearing an end the hope lies in the resurgence of cultural excitement and creativity among the young if for no other reason than through cultural fallout there is cause to be optimistic about the theatrical arts but there also appears to be more concrete cause all over the country young black minds which have been inspired and liberated by the black revolution are seeking out fresh and native modes of expression they are finding the courageand increasingly the supportto turn their backs on the grand gurus of the arts in america who would define for them the nature and needs and limits of their artistic expression with that said it also must be admitted that there is little theatrical activity around at the moment to make the hope for the future seem much more than that there is a great deal of theatrical activity yes but much of it is of the conventional variety primarily conventional in both conception and goal there are however certain outstanding exceptions most of them centered in the area of manhattan in a way the most important theatrical enterprise in new york is the new lafayette theater which under the direction of robert macbeth got off to a bright start last october mr macbeth and his small company took over the rehearsal hall of the old lafayette theater in harlem and aided by grants from the ford foundation the new york state arts council and the rockefeller foundation launched a season with playwright ronald milners whos got his own which a season earlier had been produced downtown at the american place theater they also did athol fugards the blood knot mr macbeth brought in playwright ed bullins from san francisco as playwrightinresidence and scheduled mr bullins threeact play in the wine time for spring production things did not go entirely well however and the first of the year found mr macbeth and company on the premises of the american place theater where mr bullins three oneactersa son come home which is published on page and the being the claras old man electronic niggerwere prepared for performance problem uptown was primarily one of funds an old sad familiar story the beautifulif impractical innovation of the new lafayette theater was the free entrance policy for the people of harlem the people came to the seat theater that reported percent and mr macbeth the theater was filled on week days and completely filled on weekends then in february the new lariously ing comvard ver phil cohran copyrighted material the mr fayette theater myste burned leaving the fledgli pany with no base tov end of the month howe macbeth announced that he had received another grant from the new york foundation contingent upon his raising matching funds and that a campaign was underway to secure for the theater meanwhile he was searching for a theater of some seats in the harlem community and he seemed hopeful mr macbeth was quoted in the new york times as saying that the new theater when it is located will do adaptations or revisions of the works of bertold brecht and albert camus as well as the works of black playwrights one hopes that he will reconsider this there are hundreds of theater groups on and off broadway performing the works of white playwrights black playwrights desperately need the exposure black theater groups can give them the theater which had raised the highest hopes and which caused the most excitement over the past few months is the negro ensemble company the brainchild of douglas turner ward and robert hooks the nec as it is popularly termed is considered elsewhere on these pages in articles by peter bailey and dick campbell but it is fair to note that the unfurled program of the theater met with considerable disappointment in the black community the nec received an unprecedented from the ford foundation ostensibly for the promotion and cultivation of the theater arts among black people and it was generally accepted that the nec went out of its way in failing to fulfill a part of its purpose the criticism centered around the necs failure to seek out and produce the works of black american playwrights of the four plays announced for necs first season three are the works of white playwrights although one play was adapted from the french by the late richard wright the fourth play kongis harvest by the nigerian wole soyinka had its premiere performance during the first world festival of negro arts at dakar senegal in april confronted with this criticism mr ward responded by indicating that acceptable plays by black playwrights were not available such playwrights as loften mitchell alice childress ted ward and ronald milner replied that they had not been approached by mr ward or anyone else from nec that criticism aside the nec evidently is living up to its expectations in other areas in the companys first production peter weiss song of the lusitanian bogey the acting was all firstrate the staging provocative the direction keen and powerful and this was the work of black actors directors and technicians mr ward has indicated that in succeeding seasonsthe nec will produce the works of black playwrights it is to be hoped that this will be so nevertheless one is left with nagging questions about the real intentions of the nec directors relative to the black community mr ward sought to justify the location of his theater in greenwich village on the grounds that it was between harlem and bedfordstuyvesant the two major centers of black population in the new york area thereby facilitating travel to second avenue and eighth street by people from both communities it is a flimsy rationalization the nec appeal is directly to sophisticated white audiences on a typical weekend night there were five black people in the capacity audienceand at least two of those gained admission with press tickets a short distance from the negro ensemble company headquarters in the st marks theater the greenwich mews theater provided a showcase for two plays by wole soyinka the highly regarded nige rian playwright the plays the strong breed and the trials of brother jero were produced under the aegis of farrisbelgrave productions in association with diana sands and afolabi ajayi cynthia belgraves the actress also served as director of the plays the production received almost unanimous raves from the critics and the performances were unquestionably excellent although this writer had seen a superior production of the trials of brother jero several years earlier at karamu house in cleveland ohio as an example of the vitality and enterprise present among black theater people the farrisbelgrave production was singular also it was high time that new yorkers were exposed to the work of black africas most respected playwright again however it is a pity that the people of harlem and bedford stuyvesant will not have easy access to the presentation of talented black theater people in this writers opinion the theater group in the general new york area with most immediate promise for reaching the black communities is playwright leroi jones group over in newark the spirit house movers and players is a repertory company which already has traveled as far afield as massachusetts washington dc connecticut and pennsylvania and there are plans to troupe out to the midwest in the spring at the present plays in the repertory include the militant preacher by ben caldwell arm yrself or harm yrself by leroi jones and we own the night by jimmy garrett three additional jones playsa black mass great goodness of life and home on the range plus plays by ed bullins joe white and ben caldwell are in preparation for the company the spirit house movers and players is of course innovative in intent its format is broad enough to embrace for example skits and poetry readings and a youth group called the young black militants all presently years of age is a popular feature of the theater group among the actors at spirit house are yusef iman barry wynn carl boissiere david mitchell larry miller mubar ic mahud salimah barbara wynn jacqueline bugg sandra lein sylvia jones and herbie stokes robert washington is stage manager and james campbell and leroi jones are directors march was scheduled as the month for the opening of a doublebill by playwright william wellington mackey in new york assisted by actors agent ernestine mcclendon the playwright brought in from chicago the young director who staged a successful production of one of the two plays requiem for brother x at the hull houses south side theater a year ago the companion play family meeting has never been produced previously dick gaffield is the director during the past season there were several plays both on and off broadway which featured black actors in substantial roles diana sands of course portrayed the title role in george bernard shaws st joan a production of the repertory theater of lincoln center miss sands is a fine actress and st joan was well staged and well acted but the whole affair held little attraction for black audiences claudia mcneil appeared in a silly charade called something different and pearl bailey headed still heads a cast of beautiful black people in the colorful fluff hello dollyl josephine premice took the leading role in a new version of truman capotes fanciful house of flowers and cleavon little was the black sex symbol in scuba duba a group of vibrant and attractive young people black and white made of the musical drollery hair an especially delightful and provocative evening all exuberance and irreverence and as relevant as rain and air almost unnoticed black dancers and choreographers have stolen the theater lead from black actors and playwrights never before has afroamerica been represented by so large a contingent of superlative dancers several of whom also are choreographers of the first rank among them carmen de lavallade alvin ailey donald mckayle eleo pomare talley beatty miguel godreau judith jamison james truitt rod a rodgers arthur mitchell most of these dancers and the works they perform unfortunately are unknown beyond the new york commuting area it is a pity one of the cultural foundations could do a great service by sponsoring say the alvin ailey dancers on a national tour of black communities across the country los angeles seems to have completely overshadowed san francisco in significant theater activity according to our west coast editors the five most active theater groups in the metropolitan los angeles area are mafundi institute douglas house foundation pasla performing arts society of los angeles iccc inner city cultural center and ebony showcase there are of course other groups the institute for black studies for example has a theater wing mafundi which in swahili means artist institute was founded to explore black art and culture it was funded through the brooks foundation actor william marshall is director of the actors workshop and oscar brown jr heads the resident musical group the actors were preparing a black version of oedipus rex at deadline and the musical theater was plan ning a musical under browns direction mafundi institute also is concerned with developing the cinematic arts within the black community the douglass house foundation is perhaps the best known cultural center in the los angeles area because of screenwriter bud schulbergs association with it harry dolan whose screenplay losers weepers was performed on nbctv is director the theater group recently presented an adaptation of herbert a simmons novel corner boy douglass house also sponsors a tv film theater workshop pasla is directly concerned with establishing relevant theater in the black community and the thrust of the organization is nonprofit the theater performed a play for children liar liar during the winter and was preparing several projects at press timein times like these an anthology of folklore among them the iccc is federally funded and is designed to serve the total community with emphasis on those members of minority groups which have not previously had access to training in the theater arts it has received almost from the us office of education and from the national foundation on the arts and the humanities the iccc produces such plays as the seagull richard lit and the caucasian chalk garden the classics in other words of the better known theater groups affecting the black community in los angeles perhaps the ebony showcase is most important the seat theater which is owned by nick stewart was presenting douglas turner wards two plays day of absence and happy ending at press time professional actors as well as novices are involved in the theater and it could develop into the western anchor of a string of independent black theaters across the country in between new york and los angeles the picture of black theater is gloomy in detroit there is the usual number of embryonic groups with talent dispersed and interest uncorralled the most hopeful group now as in the recent past is concept east theater which considers that was an exciting year like newarks spirit house movers and players the concept east theater has turned to repertory theater the actors traveled outside of the state for performances and it is available for community organizations within the state under a joint arrangement with the michigan state council for the arts david rambeau is director mr rambeau also is editor of a new publication the black arts theater magazine chicago is virtually without a vital theater group althoughhere againthere can be found a number of small striving drama units playwright ted ward founded the south side center of the performing arts and reconditioned the louis theater a former movie house but the theater company has not been able to touch the vast black community for several months mr ward presented his yearold play our lan playing on weekends it is not unfair to say that a more recent play might have brought mr wards valiant efforts more attention another chicago theater reconditioned like mr wards is proving a more attractive center for the black community although the theater is not reserved for drama alone the affroarts theater is the base of operations for phil cohran the composer and his artistic heritage ensemble fridays through sundays the public is invited to be entertained by a package assembled by mr cohran consisting of singers and dancers all accompanied by the artistic heritage ensemble the theater also serves during the day as a center of black studies with classes in arabic and swahili lectures in african history and islam during weekday evenings the theater is available for blackoriented presentations and mr cohran is especially interested in having drama groups make use of the theater facilities local dramatists such as val gray ward and gerald wallace alone and with groups help to keep the spirit of theater alive in the city the best known black theater group in the south remains the free southern theater which operates out of new orleans traveling to nearby rural areas under the direction of tom dent black actors however do find employment in white theaters in minneapolis michigan and washington dc it was in washington incidentally that one of the best plays of the season was produced how ard sacklers abrasive the great white hope the play is based on the life and career of former heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson and it is a lulu both episodic and long over hours the play nevertheless demands the attention and it is never boring much of the credit for that of course must go to james earl jones who portrayed jack jefferson johnson he was superb and he was supported by a fine sensitive performance from jane alexander it has been announced that the great white hope will be produced on broadway next season over in rochester mich a suburb of detroit the john fernald company of the meadow brook theater presented and people all around a play based on the murders of three civil_rights workers in mississippi four years ago the play is by george sklar and it was produced a year ago in england at the bristol old vic the play was not warmly received here whether because it is not a good play we cannot report not having seen it but the music and lyrics by booker t bradshaw jr were wildly praised mr fernald it should be noted is not an american but an englishman a former director of the royal academy of dramatic art in london the university of california extension at santa barbara in cooperation with the department of dramatic art conducted under a grant from the us office of education will hold a summer institute repertory theater featuring plays by four black playwrights between june and august the plays will be performed by a repertory company of teachers and trainers in theatrical programs in junior and senior high schools throughout the nation the institute staff includes owen dodson and william brown both familiar to drama students at howard university fellows at the institute will receive weekly with an additional per week for each dependent hoyt w fuller ear don when you told me that you were writing a review attacking robert haydens book kaleidoscope i told you that if i did not agree with you i would write an answer i have read your review and i am writing an answer this is not easy as i know and respect both you and hayden however i shall try to keep my eyes on the object which is the book and to avoid irrelevant issues first i must say that it is not so harsh a review as i expected you tacitly admit the importance of the book by writing a sixpage review of it if it were a negligible book it would be dismissed in one or two paragraphs or not reviewed at all you say that for most readers a sad disappointment is in store then you contradict yourself by praising most of the poems one does not expect every reader to like all the poems in an anthology but when you treat the poets one by one you express liking for the poems of all but two or three you find fault with haydens choices of hughes and jones poems but thats a matter of personal taste the remark you attribute to leroi jones that all it takes to compile an anthology is scissors and a little imagination may be taken out of context as it stands it is so obvious as to be silly an anthology is a collection where else can an editor gather a collection than from previous publications sometimes an edi tor solicits unpublished poems but such collections are not always successful as some poets submit old poems which have been rejected or new poems not quite worked out which later they regret having published prematurely perhaps jones remark would make better sense if it were amplified to say that editors should not confine themselves to other anthologies but should do research in periodicals and the books of individual poets that is what hayden did you say hayden used his imagination in writing some of the biographical sketches but you dont document your charge its true that some of the poems have been anthologized before but you should note which poems and how often some poets like hughes have a large body of work and an editor has a wide choice which hayden took advantage of including several littleknown hughes poems others like toomer whom you praise have published only a few poems and an editors choice is limited in an anthology readers expect to find some familiar poems along with unfamiliar ones a reader reaches for his anthology not the individual poets book which most likely he doesnt own to find classics like if we must die and from the dark tower an editor includes classics like these along with unfamiliar or new poems which will be come classics in their turn what is bad is to constantly reprint a poets secondbest work like tolsons dark symphony preventing exposure of his better work hayden avoids this trap with tolson you call countee cullen emasculated true he wrote in the traditional forms and was influenced by john keats that does not emasculate anyone i dont remember just what i said to you about poems being reprinted in anthologies as i have said various things one remark mav have been that poems become wellknown by being reprinted in anthogies as collections sell more widely than single works another remark may have deplored the reprinting of one poem to the neglect of other work you say that was the second appearance of booker t and w e b in an anthology actually it was the third as it also appeared in rosey pools ik ben die nieuwe neper i dont think three appearances is overexposure in addition hayden selected two poems of mine which had never been anthologized george and souvenirs a percentage of two thirds new poems is a good ratio i believe as i said before i dont find too much to object to in your review your biggest criticism seems to be not with the poems but with haydens introduction i cant follow the beginning of your review very well as its incoherent and confused as one example you say those very words poems by american negro poets and not the books title will sell this anthology those words poems by american negro poets are part of the books title they are what is known as the subtitle often but not always an author chooses a striking original word or phrase for the first part of the title and explains it by a second phrase i think kaleidoscope is an excellent choice a brilliant poetic word suggesting the color and the variety of the poetry in the book the hackneyed second part of the title is a prosaic explanation of the poetic first part this word was chosen by a poet not by a salesman nevertheless i think it will attract many buyers who will feel that the sensitivity which could make such an apt choice would also select good poems as a second example of confusion you ask why we need negro sic anthologies hayden answered that question on page xxiv of his introduction ideological weapons are needed hayden does not antagonize black poets by calling them negro poets he calls them negro poets we do not need ghettos etc television and the other mass media are indeed white ideological weapons all the more reason for us to have some hayden paid his dues by writing distinguished black poetry before you were born his gabriel hanged for leading a slave revolt frederick douglass runagate and middle passage will be alive when you and i are dead and what a gifted poet has to say about poetry is always worthy of consideration have you forgotten voltaires i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it as i interpret haydens remarks they boil down to the conviction that a poet can write about anything without restrictions and that his work should be measured by rigorous standards without inferior work being puffed up just because its black either by white condescension or black chauvinism i agree with your approval of the format and arrangement one excellent feature is the short critical remarks about each poet although perhaps few of the poets will like them as hayden impartially touches not only their strengths but also their weaknesses the book was not intended to be a comprehensive survey and enough poets are left out to make a creditable anthology among them don l lee etheridge knight sonia sanchez carmin auld goulbourne le graham sarah webster fabio welton smith edward spriggs bobb hamilton rolland stallings lawrence p neal theodore horne raymond patterson jay wright and others this is not to criticize as the book accomplishes its purpose of giving an introduction to negro poetry but to observe that other editors can say here is gods plenty and can roll up their sleeves and follow your prescription or proscription of taking their scissors and pasting up another anthology yours dudley randall dear editor sir mr randalls objectivity is somewhat ambiguous or is it just a device he uses to make his remarks sound more convincing at times faulkner in reference to negroes thought he was objective too mr randall is about as objective as an anteater looking for food his friendship with mr hayden is widely known and he should not hide behind a meaningless euphemism mr randall indicated to me before my review was printed that if he disagreed with me he would write a rebuttal which is fine but lets not hide behind an innocent term friendship is preciousa friend is a rare book of which but one copy is madeand a friend or his work should be defended if one deems it necessary first i did not start out or intend in anyway to write a harsh review of mr haydens book i tried to constructively criticize kaleidoscope as truthfully and as honestly as possible in accordance with my beliefs and ideals naturally my personal feelings as to what art is and the function of said art would be expressed in very certain terms i am not so objective as mr randall i agree with mr randall mr haydens book is important the question is in what way does the importance of kaleidoscope live within the context of being a meaningful and eloquent addition to black literature i doubt it is it that kaleidoscope exposed us to young new inventive writers no or even old new inventive writers is it that mr haydens book published heretofore unpublished and hard to find poetryif you consider miss phillis wheatley hard to find yes what is the significance of kaleidoscope there is none except that it is a poor extension of western white literature the bookif not for this brief exchange of wordswould have traveled from editor to publisher to printer back to publisher to book stores unnoticed few if any advanced reviews were written the publishers promotional efforts were minute and the majority of black stores as well as white ones did not stock the book mr randall misread me for i didnt say that for most readers a sad disappointment is in store i qualified my statement with for those of us who buy and read anthologies a sad and also added that blacks who carefully read negro anthologies will be aware of the fact that of the poems in kaleidoscope almost half have been anthologized elsewhere by my count as i see it there is no contradiction but a case of poor reading on mr randalls part as to where the reprinted appeared and to their frequency i would need another six pages yes i feel that mr haydens book is important i reviewed it yet those people who he is obviously trying to appeal to have virtually overlooked kaleidoscope why has not kaleidescope been reviewed by white critics why has the budd schulberg watts anthology received reviews while mr haydens bookboth came out late last yearwas completely blanked out is kaleidoscope important only to black people or will whites read it too mr hayden not only used his imagination in writing some of the biographical sketches but he expects us to believe him he says of miss brooks that she is considered bv some as a spokesman for her race miss brooks has had valuable things to say but she has said them as a poet not as a polemicist that is to say that one who is a polemicist cannot be a poet first we must not forget that to be black in this country is to be controversial and that polemics are associated with controversy second good poetry by nature of style and content can be polemic eg the chicago defender sends a man to little rock of leroi james he said much of jones poetry is in no legitimate sense racist and propagandist which is to say that a good portion of jones poetry is racist and propagandist for negro professors of literature it may appear to be that way but i suggest that mr hayden reread jones as a black poet and not as the type of poet he wishes him to be jones art is that of the present day black man and he sent that other art back to where it belongedgreece bc all jones is doing and very well i might add is telling the truth which is problack and it seems that the truth is not only offensive to mr hayden and others who try to cut jones up but also to a judge in new jersey if kaleidoscope is such an excellent title why should one need a subtitle to explain it mr hayden as a poet and teacher is i am sure aware of the power of words and understands the motivating factors behind them in my estimation kaleidoscope will only attract people interested in lights colors and rainbows black people will not be moved to seek out such a title and most may not even know the meaning of the word kaleidoscope in content as in its title was established to appeal to white readers and to those readers who consider themselves near white which brings us to countee cullen who was so busy trying not to write black or negro that his only significance as a writer is that he was a good imitation white poet what did mr cullen contribute to black literature to read countee cullen is to read duplicates of robert hillyer john keats and a e housman mr cullen being the exact opposite of langston hughes who did create new forms and explore new ideas and who was able to grow and mature as he advanced in age and who left a great body of black literature which will enable other black writers to learn from and grow too most if not all black poets writing today feel that the word negro with its past and present denotations and connotations is not an accurate description of them or their work ie its an insult just like being called boy all your life evidently mr randall does not know the meaning of paying dues a few distinguished poems aint gone get it black poets like leroi jones are paying dues it is a perpetual thing like eating and dying no black person living today has paid his dues exceptmaybepaul robeson and for mr randall to remotely suggest that mr hayden has is simply a lie people like web du bois and malcolm_x paid dues i now question mr randalls awareness as to the position of the black man in this country is he sick dont quote voltaires political crap to me who mr randall defended web du bois and leroi jones right to say it who mr randall defended those students of the orangeburg sc massacre of right to say it then again mr randall doesnt it depend upon what you are saying and to whom you are saying it that counts mr hayden doesnt have to worry about anyone trying to curtail his right to say it he knows what to saykaleidoscope if nothing else explicitly showed this leroi jones knew what to say too but he wanted to be a man don l lee chicago ill new needs of f i black people define in ii r large measure the new responsibilities of black leadership because of the success rather than failure of the civil_rights movement and because of socioeconomic changes a new set of priorities has been given to the many needs of black people the new priorities are generally agreed to be those of furthering the political and economic empowerment of black people the new responsibility of black leadership is thus to implement this empowerment some of the more successful leaders in another context have reminded us that political power flows from the barrel of a gun likewise and in a related matter economic power flows from the use of the dollar in both cases however the ultimate power resides in the man behind the gun or the dollar and the force that guides the man is his ideology from the premise that the most fundamental needs of black people are for economic and political power the major thesis of this discussion is that the empowerment of black people has needs of its own the foremost of which is the need for a compatible ideology ideology refers to the interrelated philosophies ideas and assumptions which guide thoughts shape attitudes and thereby underlie actions both groups and members of groups possess either conscious or unconscious ideologies some of which become dominant thus it is difficult to consider the struggle for black empowerment without also considering the dominant ideologies among black people although black people have achieved unity on many specific issues an ideological dualism has existed in black thought since the s this dualism has since then divided black people into two schools of thought polarized around the ideologies of assimilation versus black nationalism the confrontation today between the advocates of black and white together and the supporters of black_power is but the latest stage of this ideological dualism assimilation refers to the process whereby minorities are eventually absorbed into the majority group assimilationist ideologies among black people have been dominated by the pursuit of absorption into the majority as an end in itself minor themes in this ideology have advocated the dispersal of black communities and people the insistence upon a colorblind and individualistic approach to group relations and a deep and abiding faith in the goodwill of the better elements of the majority group on the other hand nationalism in the general case refers to shared group identity or consciousness of kind purposely expressed in institutional or cultural terms minority group nationalism in pluralistic societies such as the united states may take as its prime concern the affairs of the nationality group itself and may or may not seek to establish an independent nationstate more specifically ideologies of black nationalism have traditionally involved the efforts and desires of black people to control their own affairs maintain group cohesion define their own identities and to appreciate and develop their own cultural forms rather than absorption black nationalism has stressed coexistence with the majority and other minorities its most common form of expression has been in black communal and educational institutions thus black nationalist ideologies contrary to assimilationist ideologies have viewed the preservation of the black community as an end in itself the ideologies of assimilation have received considerable attention but serious literature on black nationalism is mixed in quality and lacking in quantity the tendency both in popular and academic literature has been to concentrate almost exclusively on a very narrow range of nationalistic thought devoted primarily to marcus garvey in the s and to the nation of islam after world war ii these two manifestations while important represent a very small segment of a much older larger and broader tradition garvey did not bring black nationalism to the united states it was here waiting for someone exactly like him garvey simply organized a long existing reservoir of black nationalist sentiment in a distinctive manner much the same holds true of the nation of islam to clarify the point of this discussion let it be noted that the general phenomenon of black nationalism discussed here is nationalism with a small n both ideologies of assimilation and of black nationalism have shared a concern for achieving desegregation and the removal of externally imposed constraints upon black people and both have from time to time shared some of the more specific interests of the other but the advocates of assimilation have traditionally displayed more ambivalent attitudes in conflicts between black and nonblack interests black nationalist ideologies on the other hand have historically displayed much less of this type of ambivalence and instead have been more ambivalent about whether or not to remain in the united states within each of the two major historical streams in black thought the respective ideologies have existed in many variants and have been applied to different usages and ends thus allegiances have changed with the issues and conditions of the time but throughout the broad outlines of the duality have remained most important the dominant position within the ideological dualism has shifted back and forth throughout history generally shifts in the dominant position have followed either major historical or sociological changes in the conditions of black people it is difficult to locate the historical ideological positions of black people as a whole but an approximation of the dominant ideology during different periods of the struggle can be found in the writings and statements of black leaders and intellectuals assimilationist ideologies dominated during the colonial period during the war of independence black people as in all wars hoped that their support of and service in the american revolutionary effort would bring the rewards of full citizenship rights and as in the cases of all wars fought by the united states all of which black people served in and supported these hopes were never realized wars however are great stimulators and innovators men are mobilized organized and gain wider perspectives therefore as black people came to recognize that the slogans of freedom and democracy excluded them they turned to themselves and began to develop nationalistic ideologies thus it was in the s that black people began to create black institutions and associations on a nationwide scale by the s black nationalist ideologies had become dominant the civil war and reconstruction witnessed the return to dominance of assimilationist thinking as emancipation and reconstruction gave black people the promise of freedom and full citizenship rights the promises were broken and reconstruction was shortlived but during this brief period black people secured a socioeconomic beachhead and in doing so released nationalistic social forces for this period also marked the beginning of the rise of a new black middle class and the founding of many black colleges businesses and communal institutions thus even though the ideology of assimilation dominated black thinking during the reconstruction period the sociological forces at work beneath the surface were nationalistic and thus the end of reconstruction was rather quickly followed by a return to dominance of nationalistic ideologies the unleashing of the ku klux klan in the south and the rise of the klan mentality all over the country affected black people of both ideological camps the dominant leadership bore the brunt of the attacks and chose to take a position of eschewing civil and political rights in favor of economic development as a result the dominant black leadership in the postreconstruction period came to be both nationalistic and accommodative the rationale was that political and civil_rights would follow economic growth but by the turn of the century such a position proved to be untenable since without legal rights or political power black economic interests were attacked at will and often violently destroyed it was in such a setting that the modern civil_rights organizations first appeared in the first decade of the th century as a minority challenge to the accommodative tendencies of the dominant leadership the appearance of the civil_rights leadership represented a conflict that beqan as a difference of strategy but soon the conflict expanded along the lines of the traditional ideological dualism of assimilation versus nationalism this period from the s to the s is vital to the understanding of todays ideological conflicts these decades opened an important era in the history of black people an era that is drawing to a close today these decades witnessed a leadership conflict that led to the rise to dominance of the civil_rights organizations much though not all of the leadership conflict raged within the black middle class the assimilationist side was represented by the civil_rights leadership which in its early days was considered an overly militant minority within the black community the civil_rights leaders were able to put together a coalition of black intellectuals who opposed the accommodationist policy of the dominant leadership black businessmen who were losing their white customers and the old black middle class which had achieved a degree of integration on the other side ranged the supporters of the dominant leadership which was nationalistic and had its locus at tuskegee these supporters included members of the new middle class whose livelihood was based exclusively on a black market and black political and educational figures whose interests favored black constituencies the undoing of the postreconstruction dominant leadership was its accommodative policy in regard to civil and political rights the civil_rights leadership used this weakness very effectively to appeal to the uncommitted and the confused the course of history was on the side of the civil_rights leadership black people came to be disenfranchised and segregation became recodified the needs of black people grew ever more clearly to be those which the dominant leadership believed to be too radical to publicly advocate the needs were those of full civil and political rights thus the ascendancy of the civil_rights leadership to the dominant position was inevitable because this leadership recognized the more relevant needs of the time it had the courage to challenge the dominant leadership and it acted quickly and professionally to organize and institutionalize civil_rights sentiment and with the ascendancy of the civil_rights leadership came the ascendancy of the ideologies of assimilation the civil_rights leadership has met its responsibilities of fulfilling the need of black people for a reaffirmation of their citizenship rights and it is because of the success rather than failure of the civil_rights leadership that black people have today again given the first priorities to furthering black political and economic power and development for with rights won power can be developed economic and political development are two of the classic themes in black thought both intellectually and intuitively black people have always realized that economic and political power are the ultimate powers in american societywith an edge given to economic power for this reason many black people today look to the civil_rights organizations for leadership in these areas however while the civil_rights leaders can and even must assist black political and economic development they are neither structually nor ideologically equipped to provide direct leadership in these areas the organizations which provide the structural base for the civil_rights leadership are designed for and specialize in the vitally important areas of the elimination of discrimination legal aid and defense social welfare services voter registration and a wide range of other important services but because of its specialization the structural base of the civil_rights leadership does not lend itself to developing constructing and managing those black institutions that are needed for creating jobs generating wealth organizing and educating voters and providing the independent centers of strength necessary for empowering black people the dominant black leadership for implementing black political and economic power must come from elsewhere from other structures and from a different ideological orientation one example must suffice to illustrate the incompatibility of the assimilationist ideologies with the new needs and priorities of black people an exceedingly clear statement of this incompatibility comes from a book published last year by one of the foremost national civil_rights leaders speaking of housing programs he argued both rehabilitation and some new building in predominantly negro areas is immediately needed to alleviate inhuman conditions but this should be done without foreclosing possibilities of later integration emv u added the implied assumption of the necessity for integration for its own sake strikes to the heart of the contradiction between assimilationist ideologies and black_power development assimilationist ideologies attack the very foundation of black_power the black community this same leader goes on to clarify his point and remove any doubt about his true meaning the new and rehabilitated housing in ghetto areas should be temporary constructed for a relatively shortterm period of fifteen to twenty years units should be built with a plan to tear them down at the end of that period as housing integration is advanced aside from the question of the quality and the attractiveness of temporary housing not to mention the fact that black people have had experience with temporary housing before there remains the fact that housing is one of the most fundamental internal affairs and also the fact that for black people internal affairs are power affairs experience has shown that too few members of the majority group accept the offer of integration as posing a threat to the black political base but a more serious and immediate threat to black_power shows itself in a more subtle form many black civic and religious groups are sponsoring and controlling middle and lowincome housing developments but outside interests are being allowedpartly by default but also by invitationto come in the back door and economically exploit and control the black economic market created by the black housing development such invitations are a direct immediate and harmful consequence of assimilationist ideologies a leadership whose ideologies lead it to think in terms of literally tearing down black communities for the sake of integration and whose actionswhatever the intent threaten the political and economic base of the black community is not the leadership to occupy the dominant position the purpose here is not to condemn the past or the present efforts of the civil_rights leadership for indeed this leadership deserves praise for its invaluable contributions to the struggle neither is it implied that there is no longer a role for the civil_rights organizations for these organizations are centers of black_power in their own right and in their area of specialization and the demands and responsibilities upon them in the future will be even greater yet it was less than two years ago that stokely carmichael said black_power out loud and at the mere mention of the slogan a groundswell of black consciousness surfaced and clearly indicated that an old era was giving way to a new one as floyd mckissick noted at that time will go down in history as the year negroes became black people the classical ideological dualism in black thought has again brought black people to a major internal confrontation and into a period of transition and here it is well to note the wisdoms of what the civil_rights leaders themselves are fond of saying nothing is so powerful as an idea whose time has come the reemergence of black nationalist ideologies was inevitable because a nationalist approach to life in the united states is not only desirable but also practical american society has always been one in which groups have coexisted rather than assimilated this has never been a meltingpot society at least one of the themes in black thought has always tacitly recognized this it has taken the descendants of the immigrants longer to recognize the meltingpot myth but there are everincreasing indications that their third and fourth generations are becoming more nationalistic themselves intellectually black nationalism addresses itself to the cold and hard thinking and analysis necessary for economic and political development it recognizes the harsh realities facing an oppressed people and seeks to come to grips with them directly rather than by seeking to solve them by absorption into a hostile majority intellectually black nationalism looks to group rather than individual power and power in this society is a group enterprise whether the groups are racial or based upon socioeconomic class black leadership has been a sincere leadership but the present dominant leadership has made intellectual mistakes at the turn of the century the dominant leadership which was nationalistic made the intellectual mistake of assuming that black people could enjoy power without rights the dominant civil_rights leadership today seems to have made the mistake of assuming that rights in themselves are sufficient for reaping the fruits of power if todays civil_rights leadership knows better and most likely it does it has failed to enlighten many of its ideological followers both rights and power are always needed and in a society in which power is the quid pro quo of life a minority group should seek to maximize its power for the very reason that it is a minority black nationalism is perhaps even more relevant to the needs of black people in its emotional contributions to black thought nationalism seeks to show black people intellectually why and how they should struggle together it also seeks to instill the emotional reasons for wanting to struggle together it strives to create among black people feelings of selfrespect and mutual love and esteem black nationalism labors to foster a love for black companionship an appreciation for black culture and a joy in black living it is in these emotional qualities that black nationalism contributes to the struggle some of its best moments these moments soften the bitterness and hardships of the struggle and supports a faith in the potential of the struggle these emotional aspects of black nationalism are quite serious and represent one of its strongest forces of internal cohesion this warm emotional quality gives the particular form of nationalism that has evolved among black people a very positive character black nationalism is today a minor but growing sentiment among black people it first reappeared as a slogan then came to be recognized as a new concept and is now developing into a modern ideology that draws upon its tradition but adjusts to the present and the future black nationalism will grow ever stronger as it is given new definition and a wider base for it is one of the most intellectually and emotionally relevent ideologies present today yet the strongest argument for the inevitability of the continued rise of black nationalism is neither intellectual nor emotional this argument is simply that black nationalism is the product of social forces for black people are making socioeconomic and political progress and as black people advance the very structure of this society points to nationalism as the vehicle for further advancing black needs and interests this discussion must end as it began by noting that the new needs of black people will define the new responsibilities of black leadership therefore these responsibilities cannot be defined here except in the most general of terms the heart of this discussion is that in order for black leadership to meet its responsibilities of fulfilling the new needs and priorities that leadership must bring forth a new and compatible dominant ideology the parting suggestionand it is only a suggestion since we have not yet discovered absolutesis that the new ideology be in the classic tradition of black nationalism former lightheavyjnrrrj weight champ archie vv k moore warning of communist plans to foster race hatred in the united states told the house unamerican activities committee recently that he would fight the man who calls me an uncle tom it occurred to me that archie moore might well go on unclassified forever in the same week i read where whitey ne whitey young though considerably less handy with his fists boldly stood and told an audience of university of south carolina students that sncc and h rap brown are smalltime operators this set me thinking over possible solutions to a problem which long has puzzled soldiers of black equality in this country having recently been fired from a howard university professorship by a squad of uncle toms dr thomases if you please i quickly concluded that ways and means are now just as necessary to check and select our uncle toms as once was the case and is now to select and check our leadersif only to police the distinction between the two the first foil to confront me was of course the simple definition of an uncle tom websters intercollegiate dictionary defines this creature as one whose behavior toward whites is regarded as fawning or abjectly servile the difficulty sets in here of course in deciding at just what point a black fellows behavior is fawning or servile standards of tomism change with the times and what is radical today may fall tomorrow within the concept of baldfaced tomism it behooves each one of us to watch our steps and periodically check ourselves booker t washington who was once regarded by most black persons as a kind of messiah is now widely condemned as an uncle tom and the dye grows faster with each decade i remember some years ago falling out with a friend because i called booker t a tom too soon i suppose but the friend has written in years since to concur with my judgment when rev martin_luther_king jr was first catapulted into recognition by the montgomery movement a sister of mine bitterly chastised me for calling rev king a moderate at a time when the press and partly therefore the public which now recognizes him as a moderate seemed then to think that militant was his true first name today uncle toms may be divided into two main categories the utilitarian and the pathological from which might be developed a more detailed typology should anyone take the trouble to try the utilitarian toms identify with militancy to varying degrees hating the white mans guts but behave as they do for what they regard or at least claim to regard as practical or realistic motives or worse for personal gain this is the type most frequently encountered these days and is perhaps in many ways by far the most cunning and dangerous indeed lest our readers grow too smug a tenable case could be made out for the theory that the mass of silent blacks who while scorning to take aggressive stands as uncle toms bow down in apathy at best at worst in cringing docility themselves comprise as heavy an anchor as active tomism in submerging the struggle for black equality the pathological uncle tom is a true believer madly in love with the white race he has identified with the aggressor as psychoanalysts say he is to say the least a very sick man and cannot be helped much by an ordinary layman we grow too technical anyway one could just as easily quibble about the categories of body length about the exact point at which a man moves into the tall man range uncle toms too are relative and some toms naturally manage to out tom fellow toms the purpose promised in this brief essay is how to handle persons you yourself regard as uncle toms my rule of thumb is when interacting with a tom to keep my respectful distance though some of my best friends are toms and there are nice toms and impudent toms still a man has to be discriminating in his associates people are likely to link you with them despite a supreme court ruling to the contrary and yet a word about some tactics for using uncle tomsnever mind the interesting but less important means of tantalizing them our aim is to put toms to work for the black cause bringing their forces in a roundabout way to our side not to thicken the wall now standing between us granted that some toms are too far gone to be retrieved for the purposes i am about to propose and well do i know that it is a bit too hard to try to throw ones love about to everybody still there is i think a role for everybody to play hence the need to select our uncle toms or to put up some from our own ranks with strong enough stomachs to play the part then by some sort of remote control get them together with us at least maintain communication about their activities in relation to our own for instance we could agree that we will call a fellow and his project tomish before the press while he calls us extremist then we could retreat home and pour drinks in wait for his grant finally when once he receives his grant for a million dollars say he can give us about or so for apparatus guns gasoline science and mechanics books or whatever is your pleasure for our own program that way toms who plead devotion to the black cause in america could indicate to us whose side they are really on meanwhile black militants who face it are not known for their wealth could acquire much needed operating capital presently some unthinking black radicals some wearing processed hair religiously reject the idea of white financial support they seem to lose sight of the fact that money is green our fear is lest it should slowly turn red we must guard against being bought by money from any sourcewhite black or polka dottelling our donors that money given must come without tight strings i recognize the great inclination for subtle even unconscious submission to financial sources as well as the liability to dependence on the finances issued but this we must begin to overcome in any case white wouldbe controllers of black movements can entrap us no less by giving their money as some do now to black front sources who in turn may control our policies if we can be purchased by thick green this is not to mention the fact that the amount of money available in black sources at this time is very meager even black purses with perceptible bulges are too tightlipped to be opened very wide anyway bail money which black militants increasingly appear to need by the bale could be secretly paid by undercover militants posing as uncle toms and commendably this has already become a practice one black militant claims that his apparent passion for white women is really a pursuit on his part of one of them to take as a wife and place on the street to raise money and provide a social service for black militant brothers way out to be sure but how can we know that he is not on the level we cant not in the beginning but this is no need for unnecessary alarm we cannot be sure that the fiery black militant who recently joined our committee with a stunning african wardrobe an arabic name and the bushiest hair of all is not working for the man does your organizations authority on guerilla warfare with the plan to sock it to this country plan to turn your group in on a conspiracy charge after a couple of friendly conversations is a member of the fbi on your planning board could be this brings to mind another point a couple of years ago when my the black anglo saxons was published and i began to receive invitations to speak before audiences of strangers i was frequently a victim of this kind of misconception indeed many of my less educated black brethren seemed to feel threatened egowise and confused by the fact that i a howard professor identified with the black masses which unknown to them i was a part of by birth and upbringing you must be a fake one of them might shout during a postlecture exchange in the questionanswer period if you said that around howard you wouldnt be there long well i had been saying those things and more than ever since although governmental interference was later to help bring about my removal for such views still in the minds of the average black radical all howard professors were undeniably uncle toms other militants hold this view of government employees others of black policemen and detectives yet when the fbi infiltrated the kkk the kkk in turn infiltrated the fbi we need to infiltrate the fbi to have some idea of the nature of their knowledge and infiltration of us are we not as sophisticated as the klan all of this is not to deride afro hairdos and abus both of which i possess but my point is that any police force worth its salt contains a body of plain clothesmen there is no need for whites to be able to look at us and tell what we think by the way we dress we need some secretary in the pentagon wearing a blond wig and well known as a trusted tomor is it sally so that an order from lbj to send troops to detroit could be mistyped misplaced or delayed ever so slightly to give the brothers a bit more time the supply of spiesonce armageddon arrivesmust come from the ranks of those who somehow have retained trustworthy relations and the ability to communicate with otherwise wary white enemies to shut off all contacts is to sever a lethal cord of eventual subversion the more we get together in a spatial separation desirable as that is the more subject we areunless there are those lurking as enemies withinto fall victim to air raids and bombings in an allout war not only could the whites drop an atom bomb on us we would be even by land left vulnerable to a noose of white troops surrounding and decimating us the advantages of hanging on to some inside positions though again i must be brief for fear of revealing too much was apparent when a few years back the lights went out in the new york area leaving a city helpless and stranded in the darkness of suspended elevators and blackedout streets authorities sought vainly for an explanation some going so far as to suggest that god did it undoubtedly some colored night watchman pulled that switch or so he could have all of the foregoing is representative of our new and untapped potential for togetherness power a far far preferable replacement for the present smokescreen of unity or oneness there isrepeata role for everyone to play just as on a football field there are quarterbacks fullbacks halfbacks guards and tackles the same principle holds true for any collective endeavor and in the words of karl marx the revolutionary communist theoretician e very little bit helps in a sense recently however a black radical friend of mine quoted marx to refute my proposal for corralling and yoking uncle toms claiming that marx would regard them as counterrevolutionaries who should be swiftly purged i replied that while it is true that there are similarities between russian uncle toms of yore and black uncle toms marx was not writing about us colored folks of todays world and ill fight the man who says that i am tomming to uncle toms born of africa j tf born of her soil her i rhythms her multi jy tudes i was queen of egypt and bushman peasant wife i roamed the forests of the congo and the rivers nile and zambesi i saw the travels of many an equatorial sun but most of all i was a woman a black woman in love with the black manhood of the world the mother of black children the baker of the bread however high our civilizations rose however primitive our villages in the eyes of the west however strange the pale ghost faces of those who invaded us my dedication was to him to the black man and to all things pertinent to his well being i cooked for him and bathed his feet and bore him children i laughed at his jokes and stood silent and believing when he spoke of his dreams i was proud and walked with a swaying to my hips which brought delight to his handsome black face i was straight in my stance and i looked up to him for all my needs we were a people a proud black people the rulers of our own lives and when the sun was low and he sat beside the door of our home with fatigue in his eyes i danced for him and gave him much pleasure till the sun should rise again then came the marches i remember the march across the land the first of the marches we stretched out in a great line as far as the eye could see and mixed with lion howls and cheetah screams there persisted the bonerubbing bloodcrusted chainclanking of white imposed slavery my husband stumbled amidst the chains ahead of me and my pregnant sister marched behind i remember well that the only times we were allowed to stop beneath the lashing whips while the sun was still high in the sky were on the occasions of sickness striking some person in the line we stopped on such a day one week away from the day we started marching it was to unshackle my sister from the chains her ninth month had come too soon the labor of birth had begun its timeless stroke a white slave driver threw her to the ground kicked her so hard i could hear the thud above her screams and then ordered us to leave her lying with her heaving labor alone on the earth where some kind scavenger might sink its teeth into her throat her husband cried out in anguish his leg irons dragging the ground and his wrists scarred to bleeding with his efforts to reach her he fell to his knees pleading that they leave him with her if both could not go i remember well now during sinister sleepless nights the sound of the white machete as it sung through the air and cut open his heart we marched and we died we were lashed and driven like beasts despite it all west africa awaited us the prisons on the gold coast awaited us of every among us who lived of us died among them my husband my brother my sister my mother my sons and one wellgrown girlchild my heart turned to a stone harder than some may ever know and through the stone of my heart the white men tried to chisel the art of sewing and broken english and how to bow and scrape and shuffle to the tune of yas suh and no suh i learned nothing and obeyed for my lifes sake the boats came i was packed like a bag of sop into the stinking hold most of my village was there inside that floating hole in the dark there was no air no toilet no place to move we lay shackled together amidst the stench of death for months on a tossing sea and we died again one after the other we mutinied and some of us fed ourselves to the sharks rather than remain slaves finally when our numbers had dwindled to onefifth our beginnings we landed in america in that great land of the free and home of the brave for me from the beginning of my american sojourn it has been the land of the greedy and the home of the slave for years i was americas physical slave and for almost more white america owned my mind two hundred years of my backs free labor turned swamps into fertile lands and forests into bales of cotton and cotton into northern factories and mills for years i suffered the brainwash from white mouths which beat me into acting the servantslave i sowed my best of labor music invention and faith and i reaped the racists raping knife i was taught christianity and armed with my new faith i sought to love again for so long a time i had no other hope i put my trust in jesus and all in all i was a better christian than my white teachers i prayed and i kept the faith while i lived in the american hell i met a man a slave like me and according to the white christian law of that time i married him by jumping over a broomstick among our friends i would have liked a preacher but this was not to be allowed all my pastafrica my native language uraba kamba masia my family my friends of long beforewas lost and tom from my memory the past was gone to here and now i summoned all my courage to begin again we had four children my husband and i his love was a balm to all my pain ill never forget the day when the white mistress at the big house raped him for her own and on the morning when my oldest child was eight the white man who owned us all sold us all each to a different place each to hell knows where they freed us lincoln sitting in his noble chair white father of all black children leaned down like god and told me i was free he told me to run gaily in freedom not noticing the white scars which marked the places where my legs had once been when i crawled out onto the world and looked at the white fathomless sea washing against and over me i saw nothing but horror despite the one or two kind white hands which reached out to help me i saw nothing but a lonesome horror but somehow through the years lonely and misused by panting white men i held on i saw many a black sister fall but i held on again in i married he a beautiful black man dark like africa young and courageous like the african lions in my past he gave me patience and hope to run beside my ugly bitterness he gave me love and tenderness to bolster my sagging vision of the world i was able to get jobs and he could not i wore the pants because he could not i saw him shrivel up like some castoff fruit for some time you could find my husband in harlem or bedford stuyvesant or white plains lying drunk with despair and liquor in the alley behind some shambled building or sitting with a dullness in his eyes behind some southern white house or lynched perhaps in your home town hanging to a tree or burning on a stake driven into the ground you could find one of my sons on some street corner in a dorag afraid to hope and ready to kill you could find my other son sleeping beside some fabled white chick thrilled to touch her pale superhuman flesh there was a time when my daughter was raped of all that was precious and then left to cry with no one to hear there was a time when you could find me scrubbing white floors washing white clothes cooking white food and mammying white babies with a studied attention far greater than the love i was supposed to give to my own children there was a time when i watched my husband cry into his hands as his children looked to me for bread and spending change i saw his manhood beaten and denied by a country which scorned him put its big foot on his head and ground down its heel while the owner of the foot shouted nigger there must be law and order nigger always obey the law nigger i saw every last one of us sitting by and crying and biding our time while we died every hour of every day and lived on white vomit and wished to god and satan that we were white but all that has changed for us now though some of my black brothers and sisters are still in the mire that has changed for my black family and me now the fires have come to burn the white sickness the healing fires have come i will bide my time here no more its time i turned back to loving and delighting my own my patience with the centuryold system is gone now its gone away with the thudding of the years and the dripping of my lifes blood i will wish to be white no more now i will fry my hair no more bleach my face no more for the final glow of pure sweet whiteness has faded to tarnish i see who i am now and who my man is we have begged and worked in vain too long i wont lose my husband and sons and daughters again nor will they let me be lost i am a black woman and again i have found my original pride i will stand with my black man and my blackness wherever it is found to love him to give him my strength is my total reason to be again and if it means that i must rewrite my history despite those who wrote me out of it if it means i must never sleep however long the hours and if i must bleed again and suffer scorn again i will gain my freedom my black man will be free and if it means at that point in time when the white wall will not give way and we cant push without applying a final terrible fire that i must stand beside that man of mine and follow him fiercely toward the way to white and black oblivion having found the essence of myself this black woman will not turn back the very highest y praise is inadequate in l paying tribute to the late dr_king the man was indeed a king among men successful and sensitive crusader resourceful and persuasive teacher courageous exemplar of nonviolence in the united states eloquent spokesman for the cause of justice freedom peace and humanistic ideals for all men a religious leader with a deep and abiding faith in and steadfast commitment to the essential brotherhood of all mankind author and orator of classic quality whose words were filled with resounding impact and challenge alterconscience of a nation plagued and torn by the invidious distinctions of class and the pernicious divisions of race these all too briefly are some of the accolades identified with martin_luther_king jr many of his accomplishments of a short years attest to his extraordinary stature in the world chronicles of social and political relations in the united states regardless of perspective will certainly rank him as one of the most influential americans of the th century as regards especially moral issues legislation for civil_rights and social progress for the disadvantaged he exerted a farreaching and profound impact on the consciousness of the american people none of his contemporaries matched his combined efforts in all of the areas mentioned here and especially those extended for the ultimate causes of mans struggle freedom from oppression as well as to realize opportunity and fulfillment justice in the rewards and relationships of human endeavor and humanity as dignity and selfesteem as well as reason and responsibility dr_king was a studious and studied man of letters author of five books and contributor to several additional ones he has had still others written about him and his work his writing reflects penetrating insight and wide scholarship there is also the vast as yet uncounted number of essays articles speeches sermons published interviews letters and other communications of record in their own special way each skillfully appeals to the intellect the imagination and the emotion as to other credentials major american universities recognized him with both earned and honorary degrees he received awards from numerous civic agencies for his contributions to american life as orator rev king had few peers many of his speeches will long be remembered and analyzed for both content and style the most memorable perhaps is his address at the march on washington in a rising crescendo of emotion and on the refrain i had a dream he challenged the nation to rise up and live out its creed of equality for all men the last one in memphis as if in eerie premonition of his imminent demise gave clear expression to the belief that ultimately it is the purpose and fullness of life rather than its length and possessions which give it significance and provided the lasting measures of a man dr_king traveled widely and attracted worldwide attention throush his valiant efforts in the service of others increasingly he was being looked to as the most promising spiritual or moral leader of his time more than a great negro or american he was regarded as a great man of the world he went on to further renown after his international acclaim in when he became the youngest man ever to win the nobel peace prize at age unparalleled as a civil_rights leader he was one of a rare number of famous men who had the ear of presidents yet retained the common touch for reaching the masses of his people and many of goodwill of other races as well having many of the qualities of moses and gandhicourage steadfastness in the face of adversity selfless devotion to freedomhe might well have equalled their successes to the extent of winning freedom for his people if death had not come at such an early age the charisma and capacity for empathy which he had virtually would have assured this he achieved identity with the unlettered sharecropper as well as the learned scholar with the woman in the slum flat as well as in the suburban bungalow to the radical and militant he seemed mild and moderate to the forces of reaction he was radical but his commitment was crystal clear and unyielding detractors notwithstanding in his book why we cant wait he articulated the significance of his nonviolent course and cause as the able philosopher astute tactician and ardent supporter of nonviolence in america his special blend of courage style and mastery of the technique of confrontation with his adversaries served as a vital buffer between at the extreme the forces of nihilism with its accompanying violence from blacks and those of reaction and racism with their violence from whites three brief statements from his writings help to capture the essence of his philosophy which is based on the enduring law of love that the way to humanity and community is through the creative understanding of and redemptive goodwill for ones fellowman in strength to love he instructed we must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system and thereby to become a participant in its evil and through nonviolent resistance we shall be able to oppose the unjust system and at the same time love the perpetrators of the system for the expected outcome his account of the montgomery bus boycott in stride toward freedom is most revealing the aftermath of nonvio lence is the creation of the beloved community one in which friendship and understanding can prevail tragically however like the great soul gandhi rev king was victimized by the very incapa ft a i city of some to grasp the significance of his message about violence its brutality inhumanity irrationality and inexorably its ultimate futility the irretrievable loss of his bulletrained death in stealth and cowardice has its expected ignominy the king assassination stands as a symbol of the segregated society and its breeding of hatred racism and violence against which he so valiantly struggled if we are to find solace and sustenance amidst the void created by his murder we can look to his service commitment love and good works few men ever leave such a rich and varied legacy as has dr_kingideas ideals and values organizational efforts inspirational and worldwide interests these and more form the main part of his treasury for america indeed for the ages nonviolence and brotherhood selflessness and humility along with the other praiseworthy values recounted here will continue to be linked with his lifes work and aspirations some basic foundations of his thinking are sketched in the shortest and perhaps least known of his books the measure of a man although they are encountered in more elaborate form in his other writings in it he expresses basic beliefs about the purpose meaning and dimensions of life its potential rests on the boundless reservoir of mental moral and material strength which lies within the grasp of each unique human personality from this man develops the capacity to triumph with positive virtues and values in the fact of apparent weakness and even in defeat perhaps his experience and eventual disengagement in the albany georgia protests of and in his chicago efforts of to launch and sustain the movement in the north are cases in point by drawing from the reservoir hope can be retained under conditions of despair love can be evoked in the face of hate he makes it clear that when hate and despair prevail men fall victim to frustration disillusionment alienation or to an even more pathetic conditionthat of violence and destruction the full life then is one in which there is a combination of positive virtues and values with strong commitment and action that results in the reconciliation of high order principles with practice of idealistic rhetoric with reality only two of dr_kings organizational efforts are mentioned although he made contributions to others and his name is linked indelibly with organized demonstrations and campaigns for social change in cities of the north as well as the south considering their initiative timing import and successes dr_kings work with the montgomery improvement association founded in and the southern christian leadership conference founded in can be consid ered a noteworthy monument under his leadership as president the former provided the coordination and support for the successful bus boycott in that city see stride toward freedom this was an important victory because it built solidarity among the negro community led to a change in the laws of segregation and proved the efficacy of the boycott as an instrument of progress in the social economic and political life of negroes his prominence eventually transferred to the southern christian leadership conference of which he was also the first president and brought it to the forefront among the major civil_rights groups especially in the south it attacked the problems of discrimination and injustice through voter registration basic and citizenship education selfhelp programs of economic and political action and other means of nonviolent protest in summary several perspectives gleaned from his writings are instructive as suggested by the following develop a full measure of spiritual power and moral leadership for that is the path to virtue be right and resolute use reason and restraint in the struggle for freedom for these noble means carry dignity consistent with such a worthy end strive for harmony and unity in the complex and interdependent relations that make up the human condition for the whole part of man and society and must work in concert in order to realize their full potential achieve both material and spiritual sustenance in the pursuit of love and the values that sustain us in a healthy viable mental and physical state of wellbeing for that is required in developing the dimensionslength breadth and heightof the complete life these are but few of the goals and guides to be drawn from the king legacy they are extensions of his contributions in making his precepts and examples livable and believable all exerted an obvious and pervasive influence in his own life and beliefs these and other teachings he has offered to us they have been implanted in the national body politic as his challenges have been on the national conscience but like all teachings and challenges it is up to the taught to learn and use them up to the challenged to make them opportunities and benefit from them finally the insight and prophetic quality of much that dr_king expressed should serve us the living in shaping the future of life in america we have reached the crossroads of our journey as a society condoning segregation injustice and racism those marked the other way are routes leading to violence destruction and inhumanity those marked the king way are upgrading routes leading to nonviolence construction and humanity in the title of his book he posed the question which each of us must answer in some way since our own destiny will be touched by the collective answer that is finally given where do we go from here chaos or community if the answer is community dr_king in paying the supreme sacrifice to gain for blacks freedom from an environment impoverished by white oppression and for whites freedom from an environment impoverished by their own hypocrisy and racism will not have died in vain the work of martin_luther_king jr was for the good of america and mankind taken away in the vibrant fullness of manhood by his loss both america and mankind are the less his death diminishes us all because we too are involved in the work of america and mankind yet we the living can be working still we must be for the system the way of lifethe hatewhich produced the murderer holds us all in peril dr_king offered an alternative it is in his path by his creed through lovethat we shall be free at last free at last that we shall overcome letter from a black girl the rages in me now are j dangerous i am fully jl s aware of the crises the danger but i still feel the rage it rocks me totally unlike the soothing rock i was not mentally cognizant of as a babe comforted in the weight of my aunts arms i walk torn by grief bitterness depression and periodic depths of sheer hopelessness i walk into my office surrounded by white faceswhite laughing faces white apathetic facesand i drink water from a fountain surrounded by black faces black laughing faces black apathetic faces and i scream inside do you care white face do you care black face do you shed tears that the man died because all he wanted to do was help somebody somebody like you and me and i cant stand the pain it shoots through me like electricity and i scream outoh god im burning inside give me some water to quench this flame but there is not enough water in the mississippi to kill this conflagration there are not enough extinguishers to stop this burning it is growing and it is frightening me i pray for strength i must pray for strength because when i hear that white face saying oh thats too bad and i hear that black face saying oh thats too bad the effrontery is too unbearable i then know that the words of the man and the words of the apathetic smilers must make a nobody like me a somebody whose bones will ache trying to do something it seems to me that the beginning is to honestly care thus im posed with the problem of what to do what can i do i have to do something i cannot live with myself look at my plain face in the mirror and as without conscience do nothing the bell has sounded it shook me like an earthquake the lightning has struck and drenched me with care and i lay limpnever again to be the same how could i possibly be the sameunless i am an android with the reading off off flashing in my mechanical heart the point is that there is not enough action after the temporary overpowering feelings subside the constructive anger dissipates too quickly the tears dry too fast and we are our old selves too soon and it is the old selvesthe old souls that have to be washed over and over in the blood of those who die for us one would think that some bodies would start washing their own souls one would think that some bodies would be tired of the aching hands tirelessly scrubbing at them one would think that some bodies would start caring about some bodies other than their own we really act like androids waiting for someone to push our button we are the greatest beings in the worldgreat at watching great at listening and agreeing and the greatest at forgetting we just love to see others sweat and die for us what is ita kick a narcotic it seems to me its about time for cold turkey we are so insincerely touched today its pathetic and so untouched tomorrow its more pathetic what is the formula for caring sunday and not caring monday yes im in a rage and i want it shared i am appalled because not enough bodies move when a scream of help is heard in the night not enough individual human concern reaches those in need we are too busy playing bridge and golf sipping cocktails and watching the idiot box how long will fools be fools we ought to be ashamed of our parts in this cancerous society our bodies ought to be imprisoned caged like the feelings in our hearts what are we going to do the man went up to the mountain top and crossed over for us but how long will each of us smell his fragrance portrait of young writers in a workshop for chicagos obac organization of black american culture w writers workshop literature is a truly lively art for more than a year the pursuit of literary reflection of the black experience has animated the writers and their weekly sessions during this summer the workshop will publish the first of a projected series of anthologies called nommo including the work of workshop members future publications also will include the work of young writers not affiliated with the workshop during the past year two members of the workshop have published collections of their own he obac writers workshop is not just another writers workshop it has a special aim and orientation reflecting the general principles of the parent body the organization of black american culture in its statement of purposes the workshop presents the following outline the writers workshop of the organization of black american culture is a communityoriented unit with the general aim of seeking out and encouraging the literary talent within the black community beyond that the workshop strives toward the conscious development and articulation of a black aesthetic and the following goals are inherent in this larger one the encouragement of the highest quality of literary expression reflecting the black experience the establishment and definition of the standards by which that creative writing which reflects the black experience is to be judged and evaluated the encouragement of the growth and development of black critics who are fully qualified to judge and evaluate black literature on its own terms while at the same time cognizant of the traditional values and standards of western literature and fully able to articulate the essential differences between the two literatures poet gwendolyn brooks works very closely with members of the workshop encouraging them to try their wings in any direction they feel inclined to fly in the spring she contributed toward the publication of the groups anthology nommo the famed poet also frequently entertains the writers at informal gatherings in her home inviting them to meet distinguished artists and writers who are her guests while appearing locally in his hit musicaldrama golden boy sammy davis jr donated to the workshop and promised another during the year workshop members however are not merely on the receiving end last winter for example they organized a benefit for poet leroi jones convicted of guncarrying charges during last years rebellion in newark the funds will be used to help mr jones pay the costs of his appeal the workshop which has an opendoor policy receives visitors during its regular sessions and invites aspiring writers to read from their works and to join the freewheeling discussions the writers also go out into the community reading for young people at community centers and for adults at taverns and churches they have organized a speakers bureau to coordinate appearances before groups locally and nationally hoyt w fuller one of the founders of obac acts as chairman of the writers workshop leo proudhammer age and his older brother caleb had just watched their parents dance merrily to a calypso it had been a rare occasion in which the proudhammer parenis transcended their sorrow the terms of their existence in americaand discovered briefly the joy that comes with owning ones own life they were smiling writes james baldwin in tell me how long the trains been gone dial press an indescribable smile moments later daddy proudhammer in the process of clicking the radio dial away from the news is asked by his eldest son now dont you want to know whats happening in the world to which his father responds no aint no white boy living can tell me whats happening in the world not before they find out whats happening on my job it is not to be sure the novels most dramatic or exciting scenebut it is nonetheless illustrative of the powerful symbolism and imagery at work throughout this story about one black mans struggle to overcome the definition of himself handed down by his white countrymen which he accomplishes fairly quickly and his longer more difficult struggle to accept that self which rests beneath the mask of color and to discover finally something actual about the human condition one is not aware of a black actor on the american scene with as great a depth as the novels hero actor leo proudhammer however one is aware of james baldwin who because his is the voice of an unusually civilized mind in this primitive land may indeed be our greatest writer and who without question has written the most important novel of this crucial decade in american history it is precisely that american historythe ugly facts which one yet seeks to deny and which moreover prove difficult to comprehend when revealedthat must be accepted if one is to consider the life of leo proudhammer and not as his story unfolds feel menaced by its utterly painful comments upon ones own life enter the novel by way of suffering with proudhammer a heart attack enter sailing as it were on the recognizable waves of baldwins prose into the pain of an actor made famous rich and notorious because he cast himself into a love role rather than remain our kind of actorcast by directors one despises into roles one hates proudhammer takes us back to the harlem of his boyhood where we discover him to be an avid listener a sensitive youth who very early makes the allimportant connection between better acting and wisdom he learns early the art of allowing others that most desperate of needs the belief that they are winning and perceives that what is routinely dismissed as good luck is nothing other than the product of ones own cunning all of which provides him with vision beyond the garment center that claimed his father and at first appears to have invested in him an unshakeable confidence but which upon further examination turns out to be nothing more than temerity enough to carry him from the inherited degradation of harlem to a selfimposed romantic degradation in the village that further examination occurs when key actor proudhammer hardly challenged by harlem or the village attends with his white friend barbara an uptown theatrical party where he encounters a better actor than himself the party as an event in literature might prove as devastating to any number of readers as it could have been in the life of leo proudhammer on the stage of life in a very real sense for the first time proudhammerat the mercy of a white directoris dragged to the bottomless sea of his own bitterness it is the moment in which he makes that much avoided but gravely essential discovery that he too is vulnerable can be had can in fact drown and is without means of securing his life raft except by paying that historic price which price is coming to terms with the rage that is his own rage that pretended to sleep but it never slept the merest touch of a feather was enough to bring it howling roaring out it had no sight no measure no precision and no justice and it was my master still as baldwin has written elsewhere how painful it is to repeat these words that haunted the reviewer throughout his foolish years the question of color operates to hide the graver questions of the self proudhammer survives his rage and one comes upon him a hungry cat still years and much hard work away from fame standing on an empty stage in an empty theater at an actors workshop in new jersey i looked out at the dark spooky theatervery spooky now with the rain roaringand wondered if my destiny could be involved in such a place but destinies as i was beginning to discover are strangeand must be being so mysteriously hung up with desire for i desired i realized one dayif these bones could liveto stand here before those living with whom i would fill this dusty void and hear them bearing witness as i now heard the sound of the rain i had never before thought of my desire as a reality involving others neither had i thought of others as needing my desire but i now for the first time in that dusty barn suspected that this coupling defined ones destiny and that on this coupling depended the mysterious life of the world i was young perhaps it is hard now to credit still less to sound the depth of my bewilderment i merely suspected in the chilling height the dusty roaring darkness the presence of others each of whom was myself but these others could not know it and neither could i unless i was able being filled by them to fill this theater with our lives this was perhaps my highest possibility of the act of love in this era of lovelessness out of the heart and guts of james baldwin comes a rejoicingly beautiful novel that seeks not to appease any taxpayer in this republic black or white who victimized by selfestrangement would honor only that work which legitimizes ones own curious version of the american fantasy or ones own fantasylike version of the american reality to experience this novel really is to experience proudhammers love which is perhaps asking a little much of the same public that held in contempt rufus from another country and one can already hear the voices shouting proudhanvner alas as though one could have as it were the dune without a mighty wind one might for a starter find proudhammer unlovable because of his long meaningful relationship with a white woman seeking solace in the illusion that in denying proudhammers history one escapes ones own so long however as one persists in believing that the tragedy in which these or or million nobody really knows were conceived way back there on the plantation can be attributed to pigmentation or genes rather than the absence of love one remains albeit heterosexual a perverted lover of the opposite race which brings one to a consideration of bisexual proudhammers homosexual relationships conjuring in the american imagination as indeed nigger pot god and all else that one has not understood has conjured images of a hell more painful more deadly and more eternal than that which one has accepted as ones life sentence on this planet my own instinct asserts proudhammer as to the male relation is that men who are far more helpless than women because far less singlemindedneed each other as comrades need each other for correction need each other for tears and ribaldry need each other as models need each other indeed in sum in order to be able to love women one is not certain what in fact a homosexual is but one is afraid that american men are all finally faggots forbidden to touch each other because the very idea of loving each other imposes upon ones imagination an experience more incomprehensible more guilty and more heartless than the sad affairs through which one so recklessly seeks that much heralded and elusive quality called manhood if in fact the acceptance of rufus required as one suspects coming to terms with americas base cruelty the acceptance of proudhammer requires of one a face with which to confront the source of that cruelty americas profound stupidity for unlike rufus who was unable to withstand this land where one is hardly out of grammar school before plotting ones own death proudhammer outdistances the national mediocrityi had had it among all these deadly and dangerous people who made their own lives and all the lives they touched so flat and stale and joyless my countrymen impressed me simply as being on the whole the emptiest and most unattractive people in the world it seemed a great waste of ones only lifetime to be condemned to their chattering vicious pathetic hysterically dishonest company there were other things to do other people to see there was another way to live and it is in his toughness where insight is seemingly endless that one might find ones own dreaded weakness the man who some time ago insisted upon his right to criticize america perpetually because he loves her seems to understand along with so few others that years is but a fraction of history a moment in mans evolution and some years ago one is reminded a system prevailed in this land that must be calledas no man can denybarbaric men politicians with no more vision than those of ones own day in the middle of that tragic era assured themselves in the act of writing a beautiful document that despite the inhuman institution to which they committed their lives they could in social terms salvage their humanity they died indeed as they lived fools and their descendentsblack and white liberal and conservative nationalists and integrationists bigots and paternalists revolutionaries and uncle toms cling desperately and with much timidity to the myth of their creation for not very many people in america have begun to understand as james baldwin so eloquently stated in at least two essays everybodys protest novel many thousands gone included in the collection notes of a native son that the reality of man as a social being is not his only reality one might wish in the confusion of a day in which writersmen who do not for one moment imagine themselves able to lead another to the promised landare expected to perform the perfectly awful rituals of the popularity contest that baldwin had plotted a novel in which the recipe out of the mess read as clearly as reads the back of a cake box but the mess which is precisely ones own life has ever been more complex than ones most daring wish and it is in just such a wish that one misses the point of the novel the pain of the novelist that he must write out of his experience and moreover in that same wish one misses as baldwin has reminded us the point of oneself that one can only face in others that which one faces in ones self james baldwin in tell me how long the trains been gone explored that phenomenon one thinks oneself incapable of as reflected in the vain attempts to dismiss it as irrelevant yet not even the extraordinary delusion rampant in america has convinced any among her inhabitants that anything save love will spare this nation the fate that awaits any people whose sense of human life is defined by the sword the once symbolic fire has become visible can one accept this novels fury terror rage hatred and finally its love as ones own there can be one hazards only one american dream to struggle out of this nightmare perhaps it isnt after all impossible however as james baldwin remarked a few months ago ignorance is in the saddle here and we ride mankind and ignorance it must be noted is either colorless or multicolored david llorens hould retain billyboy after we take over the schools we asked why and after we heard the usual things about how long folks have been reading him and how much she enjoyed midsummer nights dream she said he was just valuable and why the devil didnt we quit questioning gods anyway we pointed out that leroi jones has said the black man is making new gods not only spiritual but economical political organizational and in every way including literatural we only wanted to know what bill shakespeare with his racist overandundertones hashad done for the black community and her answer was nothing should a people revere a literature that has done nothing for them should a people support endeavors that do not benefit them recently in negro digest dudley randall and don l lee had a similar discussion should artists support artistic endeavors that do not benefit their people and who makes that determination these are some of the questions we had while reading curling houghton mifflin the second novel by robert boles one other possible title could have been one of dem we are disappointed when we see talented young writers engaging in meaningless discussion about how weve just got to adjust to this american situation three novels have been published this season dealing with the need to be accepted by white people or the justification for loving their women this is not only unfortunate it is unacceptable it discourages our people from reading dick and jane and up the hill to get a pail of water is not zeeley and chuch othello and up against the wall scarlett is not vyry the flagellants arent whos afraid of virginia woolfe and we need to be engaged in making that distinction any artist can only articulate whether with pen or brush or clay etc what he is and feels and knows boles has done this he like all americans has a dream and that dream is that america adopt chelsea a nigger into its rich white family that dream is that chelsea a poor black boy replace the older white son who had once mistreated a black woman and he attempts to explain how all this is possible how allen chelseas younger brother does care about him how his father did do and would do the right thing how his fathers wife who would not allow him to call her mother will grow to love and accept him in time he takes us through chelseas endless wealth his endless love for a white woman who would you believe doesnt love him the endless abuse he suffers because they dont understand that he is just like them and finally to his ultimate justification for killing another poor black man the murder is central to the theme because chelsea does not want to kill a poor colored man but is compelled to kill if he is to continue playing the life game called white like them chelsea journeys to upper new england after his rejection which is probably final by that white woman he loves he vows never to go back to his family since they so obviously dont want him but the longer he stays the longer he has to long for his old way of life shades of the happiest slave in the world he needs a reason to call upon them question how can i get the family to be involved with me answer cause a disturbance question what should i do answer kill someone result the family came to the rescue result he can remain rich though rejected result two black men dead result an unfortunate book we are always disappointed when we see talented young writers engaging in meaningless discussion to justify their refusal to be free now that its written we hope mr boles will literally explore other possibilities available to him nikki giovanni the coffee house ministry by john d perry jr published by john knox press at is a very timely and helpful book it speaks of the christian churchs effort to come of age in our time this movement is ecumenical and integrated and is a new and effective means for the church to perform the service to mankind that it was commissioned to do by jesus christ the cogent ideas of our time must have a forum and this book explains in detail how this has been attempted by the coffee house ministry it is certainly a must for any who desire to attempt this work james e woodruff i in most of our history we get the upper side of history in american history we get the europeans who came and took the land and killed the indians and brought millions of blacks here to slavery but we dont get the story of the indians and the negroes tom haydens rebellion in newark random housevintage gives us the underside of the newark uprising the official story is that negroes rioted against law and order looted and burned and were finally brought under control by the forces of law and order tom hayden who has been a community organizer in newark since tells the story from the point of view of the negroes in a brief book most of which appeared previously in the review new york review of books conditions in newark were among the worst of any large city in the country it had the nations highest percentage of bad housing the most crime per people the heaviest per capita tax burden the highest rates of venereal disease maternal mortality and new cases of tuberculosis it was trying to squeeze out the negro population by creating a acre medical school in the ghetto the mayor refused to appoint a fully qualified negro to an educational post and tried to appoint a political crony instead the uprising was touched off by the arrest and the beating of a taxi driver by the police it began wednesday and continued into thursday young people tore open liquor and furniture stores and other people poured into them community organizers felt violence could not be halted and urged that burning of buildings be held down to save lives the burning was confined to not more than buildings the looting had virtually stopped by friday when the state troopers and the national guard were called in if the purpose was to prevent looting they could have stationed small detachments in front of business places to protect them instead they drove through the streets in a war against the black community their actions were punitive it was then that the sniping began the police troopers and guardsmen were panicky and would rake entire buildings when a sniper fired this indiscriminate shooting killed innocent persons in their homes some of the white casualties may have also been caused by this panicky firing the police beat up black policemen reporting at the police station police troopers and guardsmen beat robbed and killed black citizens they looted and shot out the win dows of black business places thereby losing the support of the black middleclass perhaps the most important part of the book is chapter v in which hayden discusses the use of violence in the civil_rights struggle he says it is not just an overturning of law and order for law and order do not exist in the ghetto but it must be considered by civil_rights activists as a possible new strategy after the failure of politics nonviolent demonstrations and community organization to be effective it must not be sporadic as before but must be disciplined and organized and should be applied if only by paintbrush where it can cause a crisis among oppressive forces and give people the courage to demand changes and force consideration of a new system this is not a definitive account of the newark rebellion but it should be read because it tells the side which is usually untold and discusses the possibilities of violence where other means of redress have faileddudley randall at a time when american soldiers are fighting and dying in vietnam it is good to remind ourselves of the differences between bravery and heroism this service hardly limits the value of episodes of the revolutionary war by the recently murdered ernesto che guevara international publishers paper but if you have been brainwashed into thinking negatively about castros cuba justify your curiosity with this service in mind bravery is simply the encountering of known risks heroism is fighting for a purpose and against the odds castro guevara and other men did just that when they left mexico on november on a sevenday seasick voyage in the tiny granma they were the entire cuban rebel army and they had rifles five days after they landed at playa de las coloradas the dictator batistas soldiers and air force attacked them only men survived then they faced over two years of marching with infected feet sleeping outdoors starving fighting superior numbered and armed forces succumbing to tropical diseases and discovering deadly traitors like eutimio guerra who accepted the shelter of castros blanket one night armed with a and planning to kill the rebels leader his cowardice alone prevented him from pulling the trigger heroes fight for an ideal of nationhood and against an evil they can clearly define as the revolution grew che wrote no one can say exactly when in this long process the ideas became reality and we became a part of the peasantry as far as i am concerned the contact with my patients in the sierra turned a spontaneous and somewhat lyrical decision into a more serene force one of an entirely different value later he saw welleducated revolutionaries lose their touchiness and become united with the peasants they fought for and he observed that the revolution cleanses men improving and developing them as the farmer corrects the defects on a plant and brings out its best qualities he gives us fascinating portraits of castro to whom we felt tied by a bond of romantic sympathy for adventure and the thought that it would be worthwhile to meet death on a foreign beach for so pure an ideal castro lost time and money to free che from jail where mexican police and fbi and dominican dictator trujillos spies had joined to put him right before the granma was scheduled to sail leave me behind che had requested i will not forsake you castro told che who later wrote that such personal gestures by fidel towards those he loves are the key to the strong devotion created around him where a feeling of loyalty based on principle is added loyalty based on friendship making the cuban rebel army an indivisible whole these personal episodes however are scattered sparsely in the book which makes them all the more moving the bulk of the little book documents the realities of guerrilla warfare the synthesis of which from the guerrillas standpoint is constant mobility constant mistrust and constant vigilance for the enemy noted che is magnificently protected although only willing to fight at a safe distance from comfortable positions and against an opponent practically defenseless much the same way as the colonists had fought the indians in the west of the united statesjohn woodford you have heard of books being keys to other books eg the key to finnegans wake right well this book william styrons nat turner ten black writers respond beacon press is the key to styrons unfortunate confessions of nat turnera key yes but with this difference not a key to open a door but to lock one this book is the key that locks the white liberal up in an empty meaningless and sterile room which is his white mind and history once this door is locked suffocation is the only alternative for there are no open windows no back doors to this room as a key then this book is invaluable invaluable also for some very practical reasons first there is in the appendix the complete text of nat turners confession as recorded by thomas gray second there is a variety of information regarding the historical facts and third there is a great variety of different perspectives ie the historical psychological literary political linguistic etc on the subject of nat turner in the introductory essay john henrik clarke quotes from the historian herbert aptheker historys potency is mighty the oppressed need it for identity and inspiration oppressors for justification rationalization and legitimacy nothing illustrates this more clearly than the history of writing on the american negro people now while one cannot quibble with the profundity of this observation he cannot accept the assumption implied here that history is never based on fact that both the oppressor and the oppressed can interpret a single event differently and both be right no cannot agree only one is right and that is the oppressed people granted history has always been on the side of the oppressor but this is because it was the oppressor who wrote it the world however is becoming wiser every day we see now that history can only be on the side of the oppressed since it is the oppressed who are seeking liberation and as we say history should liberate liberation this is true history false history or propaganda to give it its right name in the name of the oppressor attempts to oppress it strives for justification rationalization and legitimacy in order to continue oppressing to understand the past and hence the present it is essential to distinguish between these two histories for one is the history of the oppressed the other the history of the oppressor and we must close the door on the latters history and swiftly we badly need this distinction in order to read properly such statements as the one from maurice merleauponty that heads lerone bennett jrs essay collected in this volume history takes still more from those who have lost everything and gives yet more to those who have taken everything for its sweeping judgments acquit the unjust and dismiss the pleas of their victims history never confesses now merleauponty obviously means by history false history or propaganda or white history because we know our history has and does confess the injustice of the white man this very book under review right now attests to this fact in his essay mr bennett goes on to accuse styron of playing the new history game of reviving big black sambo in other words he is trying to prove that u b phillips and stanley elkins were right when they projected samboto bootlicking headscratching childman as a dominant plantation type page and when styrons nat is not a sambo he is according to mr bennett a neurasthenic hamletlike white intellectual in blackface this is very accurate because when one thinks about it almost all the liberals one knows believe more in sambos and hamlets a type i never did dig than they do in for example their own wives indeed mr bennett has a good many things to say for example he shows how styron manages to change the facts of nats family life to create a proper adc slave family page his most valuable idea however is this in his determination to reduce liberty to personal passions and history to some of dat white stuff styron ignores this evidence the facts of nats actual confession and questions nat turners credentials as a leader page mr bennett refutes beautifully styrons silly notion that nats having killed only one person had something to do with his psychological motivation mr bennett shows convincingly that nat operated as a field general and as such did not have the time to spend killing alvin f poussiant md in his essay points out the psychological implication of styrons natwhat such a creation must say about styron himself i do not think however this essay goes as deeply as it could have gone in pointing out the similarities between styron and his creation i mean if styrons nat is sexually abnormal as mr pouissant says surely this must say something about styrons own sexual fantasy lifeie from a professional point of view vincent harding gets very close to home when he states that although nat is a preacher there is only one attempt by styron to make this known to the reader ie the book contains only one sermon when in real life nat must have made thousands and again mr harding is correct in observing that the book fails to catch any of the peculiar rhythmic and thematic strengths of this ie the sermon folk art form equally striking is the fact that the religious music of afroamericans never enters as a major structural element of the novel as one would expect if such a work had been done by an ellison a baldwin or a wright page john o killens contribution is valuable not so much for what it says as how it says it in this essay the thin slashes of the ironists whip is laid across every inch of styrons bare back one regrets that more of the contributors did not take a more detached oblique attack on the subject matter for as would be expected there was an occasional overlap of ideas mr killens believes that styrons first mistake was to attempt the novel the second mistake was to pretend to tell the story from the point of view of turner and it was a colossal error one that required tremendous arrogance and naivete page and so mr killens goes quickly to the core of assumptions surrounding the novel here are two irreconciliable moralities the slavemasters to maintain slavery blatant or benevolent at any cost the slaves to utterly destroy the slavery system by every and any means the masters ethics are always enslavement the slaves are ever liberation the liberator is the moral man page this is the most important idea in the book there is also in this essay a long enough quote from mr arna bontemps black thunder to show that the novel is superior to styrons why didnt mr bontemps i wonder get a pulitzer prize also in terms of the language in styrons book john a williams has a lot of insight so does mike thelwell who in his essay speaks of black language as being a language of action rather than one of reflection page and i think these two contributors are right in saying that styrons basic misunderstanding of negro language resulted in some disastrous effects in his novel the most informative essay ie apart from the historical facts which almost all the contributors shared is the one by ernest kaiser mr kaiser gives a brief bibliography of novels and plays dealing with slave uprisings then he reviews the reviews of styrons novel as would be expected white conservatives white radicals and liberals all agreed that the book was as harpers said a masterpiece loyle hairston and charles v hamiltons essays are both solidly based mr hairston accuses styron of failing to create a real nat turner because styron was a victim of moral cowardice which prevented him from seeing nat as a man as a mature member of the human family mr hamilton sees styrons book as part of what he calls white liberal rhetoric that has been going on in the writing of american history text books used in our high schools and colleges we black people should give special thanks to the people of beacon press for making possible this critical reply to such an injust book as styrons as i understand it this is a first of a series of black things that beacon press is getting together carry on cecil m brown should we follow the s configurations of time and eternity if we were black man or jew we might reach a dark harbor even as we search for a haven if we were to follow the myths of the chosen people or those of the wretched of the earth this would lead us into the beginnings of history and the configurations which we would meet on this journey so various and changing would seem dark mirages thus in our comparison of two movements zionism and negritude we cannot in this brief comparison chase all the configurations of time or explore the symbols of a statement such as i am black and comely ah ye daughters of jerusalem we will but show how two forms cast their flickering shadows partir comme il y a des hommeshyenes et des hommes pantheres je serais un homme juif un hommehindoudecalcutta un hommedeharlemquinevotepas lhomme famine vhommeinsulte lhommetorture on pouvait in these lines from the cahier dun retour au pays natal the great poet of negritude aime cesaire totally identifies with the jew depicting a brutal situation which both the black man and the jew have suffered since man is his situation he derives a power from that situation making it vital and and dynamic for instance eugene oneill is the voice of the twentieth century claims professor hartman in a recent lecture because in many ways he is the victim of the twentieth century thus out of that situation in which the black man and the jew are victims two revitalizing forces have emergedthe singing voices of zionism and negritude which have given a new intonation a new rhythm to their own historical chaos chaos prepared me and i find the track through life and darkness seek my myth move toward it hunting grow more like draw near and know it through our path know only that we run one path muriel rukeyser that one path leads from exile to return from the diaspora to the geular from alienation to reconciliation from absence from the the path will lead back to the homeland back to the earth even as it had led them astray before but the time of a symbolic return is perhaps only known by the passing wind the days have passed we are a wandering camp brighter days before us perhaps god is angry the elders have gone their bones are far their souls wander where are their souls t i v the passing wind the spirit that whirls the leaf knows it perhaps pygmy poem that dark night which this traditional pygmy poem evokes the anguish of the ancestors and the dispersion of their bones are all circumstances which give rise to those motifs of suffering abandonment and death which abound in some of the poetry of the zionist poets such as hayyim nahman bialik and tchernichovski and in that of many negritude poets aime cesaire leon damas and leopold sedar senghor my memory is surrounded by blood my memory has its belt of corpses aime cesaire and in bialiks long poem the city of slaughter there is an unrelieved darkness and destruction blood spatters the walls and corpses abound behold on tree on stone on fence on mural clay the spattered blood and dried brains of the dead bialik and in the hell hole of the poem the dead seek a reason for their purgatory tumbling and stumbling wraiths they come and cower there their silence whimpers and it is their eyes which cry wherefore o lord and why bialik in this poem there is only despair dread and hopelessness but in his longer poem the dead of the wilderness so similar in many respects to cesaires cahier dun retour au pays natal bialik resurrects the dead of heroic stature here who through an apocalyptic action momentarily free themselves from a long sleep the setting for the poem is the silence and rocky desolation of a desert where symbolically the hatred of the serpent for these dead is expressed hatred instinctive and ancient runs through the shuddering body and the wilderness midnight and monsters which crept out from the dawn of creation represents the lived geography of those who lie o deep in the earth their heads sunk heavy with tangles neglected the poet imbues these dead with life and makes them rise up in revolt a song of strength and revolt has reached us and we rise behold us we will ascend with the tempest though the lord has withdrawn his hand from us bailik after this revolt there is a purer silence in aime cesaires cahier dun retour au pays natal it is the poet who gives purpose to the desolation of the island home to which he is returning who accepts the dead landscape of his country its peoples dismal hopes who by accepting their wounds cleanses them jai longtemps erre et je revie ns vers la hideur desertee de vos plaies je viendrais a ce pays mien et je lui dirais embrassezmoi sans crainte and as damas puts it nous avons besoin de toucher du doigt toutes les plaies qui zebrent le livree noire through the union of the poet with the land he exalts the anguish of the people in these two long poems cahier dun retour au pays natal and the dead of the wilderness whose landscapes are elemental in their starkness and timeless in their barreness pervaded by horizontal images of despair and death the poets by the word make of anguish and suffering a unique quality in much of the poetry of zionism and negritude there runs then a sense of uniqueness wherein the sufferings of these peoples clothe them with distinctiveness and so in the bialik poem surely the people is grass the people receive pity as great as the sea compassion as wide as his peoples weakness strong as the weight of the burden leon damas gives a converse dynamism to endurance patience charm etc and makes of these the life force an enduring quality of the black man thus by poetic conversion he can proclaim never will the white become negro for beauty is negro but this uniqueness stems from a reaction becomes positive through a counter movement when a d gordon asks this question about uniqueness it is a rhetorical one which postulates a positive and indeed many writers of zionism and of negritude inject the people with a positive quality a uniqueness which by its very nature differentiates them from others while distinguishing them it relates them to the total history of humanity the uniqueness which is often claimed in zionism lies in the metaphysical relationship between god man and the land and that of negritude in the ontological relationship between the vital forces man and earth in both instances the earth takes on special qualities in zionism with such biblical promises as say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken isaiah chap v in negritude give that postulate of the vital forces which states that anything which diminishes the vital forces is bad anything which adds to it is good the exile of peoples of african descent from the homeland is a diminishing of the total force of the land of africa and by extension of the african thus the relationship of both jews and people of african descent to a homeland takes on a special significance and return to that homeland a symbolic quality the goals of many zionist thinkers though varying in degree all relate to the question of return to the land by the same token those of many thinkers who proclaim negritude relate to an ingathering on peoples existentially destroys the special concepts of the remoteness or proximity of these people to that point of land where the vital essence exists thus the ingathering the return becomes a philosophical possibility indeed at times a political necessity albert einstein puts it thus palestine will become a cultural home for all jews a refuge for the worst sulferers from oppression a field of activity for the best among us a unifying ideal and a source of spiritual help for the jews of every country it assures the national survival of jews and the jewish culture palestine is first and foremost the incarnation of a reawakening sense of national solidarity it is for me beyond any shadow of doubt that in present circumstances the rebuilding of palestine is the only object which has sufficiently strong appeal to stimulate the jews to effective corporate action albert einstein about zionism speeches and letters einsteins statement can be taken as one possible definition of zionism in it he stresses the cultural collective possibilities deriving from an ingathering of the jewish people it is this cultural collective which lies at the base of many definitions of negritude leopold sedar senghor defines it thus negritude is the whole complex of civilized valuescultural economic social and political which characterise the black peoples or more precisely the negroafrican world all these values are essentially informed by intuitive reason because this sentient reason the reason which comes to grips expresses itself emotionally through that selfsurrender that coalescence of subject and object through mythsby which i mean the archetypal images of the collective soulabove all through primordial rhythms these primordial rhythms express the total link of man with time for the dead the ancestors are a vital continuum between the present and the past the child is an ancestor and the ancestor a child mon enfance mes agneaux est vieille comme le monde et je suis jeune comme vaurore eternellement jeune du monde in zionism as well as in negritude whether the writers are gripped by anguish or released by revolt whether they search for uniqueness of race or a freedom from selfexile they all become visionaries who perceive the possibility of a new era in the world senghor who ahad haam who hoped to make of the reconstruction of zion a bridge between east and west giving a positive force to the world also used the image leaven in the dough to denote the necessity of adding a lift to the zionist movement the poetprophets of zionism and negritude who attempted to give the jew and the black man a sense of awareness of self of dignity and pride who attempted to inject the sum total of cultural values in relationship to a heritage when that heritage and potential seemed to have been excluded from the mainstream of world culture can all say like cesaire that ultimately their work is big tobacco brown stonewall jackson fourquet was a sailor who had found the last portthe inland pantown of new franklin february homecoming man alone all of his family even obscure cousins had found their port too the sweet potatocolored clay of crown hill cemetery a half mile beyond the towns integrated junction of stonewall jackson fourquet weighed pounds and was almost six feet tall all the old people remembered him and the violin which had belonged to his father who had played at the cakewalk dances attended by sonnys grand parents the original violin had been lost many years ago had been replaced time and again the old sailor said the sea is my wife and the violin my first born he arrived in new franklin with a brand new violin that he had bought in hamburg germany and played it that friday night at the hughes chapel methodist church social played in the beginning foreign music or so it seemed we had heard such music occasionally at the movies and on the radio and when enlightened blacks and whites from howard county and the surrounding counties descended on us with a paper bag of classical music displaying a warm toothy smile hed say i played this in paris and the white folk didnt know what to think of me playing that kind of music or a chinaman in marseilles or you aint heard nothing until you have heard a gypsy play a violin im gonna do my best to be a gypsy tonight for you and we sat hushed hypnotized in our pews and were transported to the gypsy caves of spain to barcelona you knew from the tone of the violin that the gypsies in spain were not like the mongrel pickedchicken looking gypsies that visited our town coffee hot chocolate gingerbread and deepdish apple pie was served during the intermission but everyone just wanted to crowd around and say hello and shake the hand of the local boy who had traveled the seven seas afterwards stonewall jackson fourquet switched into god bless america and ended with a pure breathtaking swing low sweet chariot a foottapping handclapping when the saints go marching in hughes chapel was on fire that cold friday night already people were calling him jackson or saying hey stonewall as if they had known him all their lives a rollicking legend he shared his real foreign world with our foreign world of dreams and went to board in the widow wilma clarks house and sleep in her spare back room which overlooked her prized cherry trees soon he was playing all over the county and for white folks too winters were long lonely and cold the only warmth was from our houses open fires and from within ourselves church once a week but sometimes it snowed so hard there wasnt any church services it was work to bundle up and go uptown to the movies on sunday afternoons the roxy was often closed because of weather and poor attendance from saturday nights showing some of us had manual phonographs and your best bet was a batteryoperated radio in case the power lines blew down or were frozen that late winter was better than most because we had stonewall jackson fourquet we talked about him constantly and saw what he had seen in our minds spring came early that year and you could hear him playing under the big shade tree beside the tracks near the railroad roundhouse and in the sweet evenings when he wasnt playing for white people on mrs wilma clarks pillared side porch he often reminisced he had a locker trunk of mementoes and photographs carefully pasted into handtooled leatherbound scrapbooks he had arrived during the cold weather which made the tattoos turn ashen like the skin of an old alligator sitting in the sun but now it was spring and his great brown arms glowed through hairy sweat an iridescent frieze roses mermaids skull and bones ships girls names and crude berber blue xs on his lollipop ears reciting foreign tales in a deep slow preachers voice or like a dying wind storm sitting on a wooden soda pop case down by the viaduct or in front of the red dog cafe someone would say hey jackson play us a little tune and hed reply what would you boys like to hear while waiting for us to make up our minds hed drift into something like darktown strutters ball the violin secure under the double layer of chin fat like a stiff board in a ton of soft concrete closing his eyes on you are my sunshine and the early morning air seemed filled with daisies daisies sprouting in moist green fields and we knew what we had suspected all along stonewall jackson fourquet was courting mrs wilma clark who was seven years his senior we were very happy for the woman who had lost her lower dental plate and lived in a dark antiquecluttered house and baked the best cakes in town that missouri summer was a county fair the yearly flood never reached its peak there was only one death sonnys girl friends oldest sister died mysteriously in weston sam lawson the town drunk found a permanent job sonnys cousin graduated from high school in boonville and received a scholarship to jefferson citys lincoln university and sonny had discovered hemingway and a new world swallowed him whole it took him a long time to recover from hemingway he did not understand mary ellas volume of freud and if he did not understand the gypsies he was at least fascinated by them foreign colorful wanderers a caravan of them arrived late in july and camped in the vacant lot fronting the new handsome white high school this lot was also headquarters for the toby ward tent shows the midwests broadway and summer stock sonny visited the gypsy caravan each morning the gypsies slept late except for a gypsy boy and girl who met him beside the school children crossing sign where they shared dr pepper soda pop and ate green apples stared and grinned at each other in a shy warm fashion the gypsy children were not interested in baseball and always did number one and two in broad daylight they seemed to eat nothing but corn one day stonewall jackson fourquet said to sonny gypsies all over the world boy once i was in algeciras spain it was a hot august night and i was a little blue black and blue i didnt even feel like playing my violin i didnt want no spanish poontang i jest started and walked out of the crowded harbor walked until i saw some gypsies camping on a little bay just outside of town behind pine trees it was hot and i was sweating like a nigger on election day the gypsies were frying fish and there was light from the campfires and moon like croquet wickets a strange light that wasnt like no day or night light pretty soon the gypsies started singing and clapping their hands they played guitars too and i wished had brought along my violin i was so lonely i jest stood a little ways off and watched them and id never felt lonely nowhere in the world i looked up at that sky getting a little black like dark was setting in though it must have been around midnight the moon was trapped like a rabbit behind clouds i knew i had to go home i was born here and i was tired of traveling i jest wanted to rest with my violin sonny and the old sailor were standing up by smittys gas station where the local fayette and boonville buses stopped heres a dime boy git you some soda pop or something thanks mr fourquet sonny said starting off he had learned when the old sailor wanted to be alone that very night mrs wilma clark had a stroke and died before morning and soon it was september and we knew winter was just around the bend and we began rationing our laughter or so it seemed sonnys grandpa was very happy that september his daughter laura jane scudder arrived with her naval bridegroom sonnys grandpa had worked for her parents as housemangardener had babysat with laura jane just as soon as laura jane had unpacked and introduced her husband to her father she brought him over to meet uncle charlie and aunt dora grandma served iced tea in the company glasses and stonewall dropped by and played sweet and sassy until dusk the naval officer kept his eyes on stonewall they talked of hong kong bombay port said of ships and the sea and soon afterwards they were meeting every day in the negro beer garden behind oconnors bar and restaurant where they drank corn liquor until it was time for the young groom to stagger to his fatherinlaws house on east main street and fall into his fairhaired brides arms mr scudder told sonnys grandpa hell he hasnt finished sowing his wild oats him and jackson are both navy men hell laura jane was worried crazy she stopped sonny in front of the post office one afternoon jumped out of her new ford car and grabbed sonny by the arm sonny boy i want you to tell uncle charlie that hes got to do something about stonewall and my husband keith hasnt had a drop since hong kong and look at him now what will people think grandpa upon receiving the message sighed so hard his mustache looked as if it might take off like a long winged bird ill talk to him grandpa said the following morning a saturday stonewall jackson fourquet walked slowly through the gate of their house morning dora he said im leaving i jest came by to say goodbye to sonny sonny was in the kitchen devouring his favorite breakfast scrambled eggs and potato cakes he had heard stonewalls dying wind storm voice and had silently said no and looked down at his plate sonny grandma called brightly someone wants to see you and guess what they have for you im coming the boy said running out of the house and feigning a smile ill see you boys later grandma said i have to bake bread sonny and the sailor sat down on the front porch stoop and stared out at the morning monochromatic street scene the sky was colorless the air humid white frame houses sand colored dust and gravel and like a giant proclamation the motionless leaves on the trees i saw your grandpa and i aint leaving cause of what miss laura jane said youre leaving for good yes stonewall jackson fourquet said he gave sonny a long razor with a carved ivory handle thank you sonny said accepting the gift for seaborne dreams thats all right the old sailor said i came back home i cant say i have been unhappy here it was jest as good as growing up in new franklin but talking to that young man made things stir in me again all the love and money in the world couldnt make me stay in this town the sea is my friend and what man would desert his best friend a white man creates a sexless black man and then invites the cats momma and daddy to dinner and we who have some kind of wild unique copyright on signification are expected not to recognize same it would appear that the white imagination scene of the assumption overload would cast upon us an unbelievable nigger in yet another attempt at denying the nigger they hold sacred which of course implies that theyre not so out of it as reflected by their endless rituals of the mind and those lame reports that flow therefrom the wouldbe work of art in question is the years smash sidney poitier spectacular that will leave you not merely trying to guess who came to dinner but indeed drive you to a whole new level of confusion if you seek to understand exactly what came to dinner the black hero dressed too sharply to be a renegade arrives in the west coast city by the gate drooling from eyebrow to belt buckleand no further brotherover dagwoods daughter who in short days convinced him that all the pains of loneliness encountered since being widowed would vanish like dandruff blending with supermarket blond hair she is bringing him home to meet mommy and pappy who of course belong to that select group of white citizens who did not instruct her in the ofay science of racism but as though to prove that modern white folk are slicker than them bygone crackers they give sugar and spice the urge to act human and save the blindfoldthe one that leaves man thinking his relation to animal is a mythfor puppy dog tails you dig it wasnt because i didnt want to says little miss muffett to a shocked mommy who in the world we know wouldve taken everybody through new chances with her tales about w wanting to get in a groove with sambo but the moviemakers their insidiousness approaching distant heights would take that ancient value that has so rigidified and immobilized white america and contaminate we who have never thought lovemaking a crime you instinctively know that the fan is not safe from the bowels but they dont even bother to bring the crap on subtly old dad turns out to be no more than another awkward elmer fudd who never once conceived of the abstractions in his lifelong philosophy coming to life and his response to this event that left him and his money helpless is that all that superficial leverage which had been his manhood came to a rapid demise he peels before our eyes and with out our sympathy down to his core near his dried up old seed symbolized of course by his dropping his coffee up tight the hollywood way but he could just as easily have gone running for the exlax but one cannot be certain that the old dudes disassembling was entirely the result of the impending nuptials for we too would endure some kind of wild shock if we were whitey come face to face with this fellow of cottonfield heritage strutting into our oalace with credentials enough to embarrass einstein who was they say one of the great white thinkers notwithstanding the fact that he failed to save jack and jill from their perversion so much for the plot the circus ensues featuring the same old drumbeat that has taught the world how much mr and mrs america are out of tune but of course claims contemporary relevance because the boy with the briefcase pretending to be a man once was a cat who knew an honorable way of getting out of his bvds true to its reputation as a world of few real climaxes white america using her socalled artists as much as her copsimposes another unreal climax upon us cloaked in garments of weakness designed to attract our tears but guaranteed to remind us that its all a farce covering up the same human body and its condition to the scene come superniggers parents all aflame over his decision to wed little red riding hood pun but sweet mother black soon succumbs to the depth of understanding emerging from mother hood which leaves out of harmony with the universe only papa hood god himself and naturally the big black wolf whose laddie went astray bring on the dramatics baby some mystical voice must have hollered because mr world leader suddenly inhales a streak of cool honesty and digs his faulknerian legacy for what it is cops a pleait was nothing moreand proceeds to give as though it contained some pertinence his blessings to the brave and daring couple of course he did not mention that the first step towards their happy dointhethang days would best be to behead him with precision not unlike that with which he had long ago deballed himself but the black conquerors old man must have been hip to that because even as they faded away from the screen finally he appeared to be doing something less than sanctioning what had just gone down perhaps even whitey is unable to tell a whole lie having not extracted all the humanity from either the black father or the soul sister maid who on occasion delivers real lines that evoke real laughter but he sure as hell tried and one is actually left pitying him because he used the same old broad to turn the same old trickdavid llorens following is the way james h malone describes his approach to art and the people i like to roam the streets in my spare time getting inspiration and ideas i can see beauty where others see slums im in touch with inner city people who are in touch with one another i can see something to portray in an old house where the whites moved out i can see on th street business as usual i see my old friends chacha big red wall street and cynthia scott then i glance through a window and i see a ghetto mother making handmedowns and i walk around the corner and run into a pretty ghetto girl my people this ghetto area just exists it is something different to paint im not a crusader and trying to say something about poverty its just an accident that im painting it im surrounded by the things i portray mr malone is talking about detroit where he lives and works he lives on the midwest side near one of the communities which went up in smoke during the rebellion of he works as a commercial artist doing newspaper advertisements for a large retail department store a native of georgia mr malone attended morehouse college later studied under scholarship at the famous artists art school and at the society of arts and crafts in detroit his works have won awards at atlanta university in the us army and he has the distinction of being the first black georgian to receive the george h clapp art award his artistic focus on the black community has gained him salutes by local radio and television stations mr malone also creates cartoons some have appeared in negro digest and greeting card illustrations he plans to offer a series of cartoons for syndication i feel that i am immortalizing americana he says americana of my time making the contemporary live though i have much respect for abstract art and appreciate it it does not give enough record of our clothing styles architecture habits and moods i am white not povertystricken freer than most because of a certain nimbleness of utterance too old now to feel or regret the loss of all the promises of the american dream but i am sick at heart of the paralysis that will not let me be my brothers keeper of the years and the agonies that let me know fully as much as the black people that my life in this country and its ideology have been a lie that the whole testament of libertarian ideas and promises i was told to live by and defend with my life has been a pious fraud i look upon our gross corruption of the rights of man the ground rules that are supposed to order my daily existence here and know that to accept this corruption is committing a sin against my own senses against the light that is in me if i accept without daily rising anger these present past and future disparities in the human condition i realize i am committing the greatest of sins that of hypocrisy which blinds a man to his own failings and gives him a false idea of his position and purpose in the world those words written from the soul of a man in a chapter called the souls of white folks reveal the rare honesty of a white american who could write a book the right of revolution beacon press in which hetruman nelson supports the black mans right indeed his human obligation to free himself from the tyranny of whites by as malcolm said any means necessary truman nelsonslike stringfellows and mertons and lennie brucesis a voice too few of his white countrymen have actually heard which is of course related to the institutionalized racism brother carmichael speaks of for let there be no mistake if the liberals whove been running the show hadnt so cleverly stored such voices in the attic of idealism and entertainment the my fellow americans mentality would not be the intelligence level to which most of this republics citizens aspire any black man who has faced a white audience in this country and their nauseating questions has wanted desperately to shove such books as this down their throatsliterallyuntil they choke up all those tv commercials without which they would have no testament to their being for truman nelson historian and novelist did not start writing yesterday and one cannot sympathize with white people who rather than face their ignorance persist in defending and glorifying an educational process in which one who would have had them know something real about their history and their real heroes john brown robert david thoreau theodore parker wendell phillips had no place but this book as well should be digested by those blacks who are occupying the places and the rejected personalities of liberated whites as fast as they fleebecause there is not alive in this land today any man more deluded than a black man who has convinced himself that he doesnt understand why the brother is raising so much hell functional blacks are asking some pretty inane questions these days giving truth to nelsons observation that there has never been an instance in the history of the world where an oppressed people have been educated for freedom by their taskmasters my italics that sentence and this book should be read as many times as is required to comprehend their importance david llorens ruchard wrights t revealing statement concerning the literam ture that he wrote had little to do with literature at all in his autobiography black boy wright recorded there are some elusive profound recondite things that men find hard to say to other men but with the negro it is the little things of life that become hard to say for these tiny items shape his destiny a man will seek to express his relations to the stars but when a mans consciousness has been riveted upon obtaining a loaf of bread that loaf of bread is as important as the stars metaphorically speaking the choice was one between the abstract and the pragmatic between a literature which did not in the words of critic stanley braithwaite hover over the race question but instead owed its highest allegiance to poetry and a realistic art which dealt with the fundamental problem of being negro in americaart which refused to either ignore or subsume the problem through adherence to critical standards acceptable to the american academic community having made his choice richard wright refused to compromise believing always that words were weapons he dared to probe levels of experience which more timid writers bypassed like goethes faust he was obsessed by an insatiable desire to delve into the pits of darkness and despair in an attempt to reveal the inferno of human discontent fear hatred and violence which is the most telling characteristic of twentieth century man having himself undergone experiences which can only be called kafkaesque in their grotesqueness like coleridges ancient mariner he was ravished with a passion to tell his story to inform the naive of the malady of terror with which everyman trapped in a brutal oppressive environment is inflicted for this reason his earliest fiction was naturalistic and there was certainly a great deal of truth in his admonition that all my life had shaped me for the realism the naturalism of the modern novel yet neither his writings nor his experiences can be so narrowly categorized the negro writes saunders redding lives on two planes of awareness which is close to saying that the negros experiences are likely to be at one and the same time both realistic and existential to be sure the negro lives in a society in which his outlook upon life his personality and his psychological makeup are predetermined to a great degree howeve r each negro despite the disclaimers envisions a coming gotierdamerung when like the existential hero he undertakes the establishment of his own identity by destroving in total the oppressive restrictive societal apparatus which he secretly loathes it is not true therefore as ralph ellison among others has intimated that wright was stifled and restricted by the form of the naturalistic novel for in the lieht of whis myriad experiences wright could not completely adhere to the naturalistic formula despite his indebtedness to emile zola the father of the naturalistic novel or to theodore dreiser whose sister carrie had a tremendous effect upon him unlike his counterparts for wright there was always the insurmountable barrier of color which constituted a wedge of such fortitude between reality and illusion as to produce a fiction vastly different from that of other naturalistic adherents but insofar as a black writer could be true to any formula wright was true to the naturalistic code yet he never forgot his earlier injunction that a loaf of bread is as important as the stars his literature therefore would always contain a schizophrenic quality wavering as did the lives of those whom he wrote about between pragmatism and transcendence he never lost sight of the pull of those tremendous forces upon the individual yet he took cognizance of the individuals obsession to crush those forces he never ceased to marvel at how smoothly the black boys acted out the roles that the race had mapped out for them most of them were not conscious of living a special separate stunted way of life yet in some period of their growinga period they had no doubt forgottenthere had been developed in them a delicate sensitive controlling mechanism that shut off their minds and emotions from all that the white race said was taboo yet he knew and perhaps he was his own best example that the personality had not been totally destroyed that all emotions had not been channeled into a predetermined direction that the social institutions had not completely transformed million people into nonthinking nonsensitive nonfeeling robots and never mind that men wore masks never mind that men refused to articulate the truth never mind that men practiced the art of mimeticsand american negroes have made a profession of the artthe atmosphere of hatred and fear which created bigger thomas is still present in modern day america goading and pushing each negro across the nihilistic brink where in one transcendent moment he is lifted above his predetermined state gaining a sense of manhood identity and social worth through the only means possible in an oppressive societythe medium of violence this is the reality of bigger thomas ignored by white and black critics alike there can however be no doubt of biggers transcendence in book one of native son bigger thomas is indeed the mechanical robot the prototype of the naturalistic character he had the feeling that the robbing of blums would be a violation of ultimate taboo it would be a trespassing into territory where the full wrath of an alien white world would be turned loose upon him it would be a symbolic challenge of the white worlds rule over him a challenge which he yearned to make but was afraid the bigger thomas of book two however transcends this fear this section is appropriately labelled flightfor it signifies not only biggers flight from the law but also his flight from the frightened unsure boy of book one to whom white folks formed a kind of superworld the thought of what he had done wright elaborates after bigger murders mary dalton the awful horror of it the daring associated with such actions formed for him for the first time in his fearridden life a barrier of protection between him and a world he feared he had murdered and created a new life for himself americans wright was to record much laterreferring to native sonhave not been able to accept my vision which is not completely trueamericans were capable of accepting the vision in part critics admit to the sanctity of the sociological argument agree that the institutions of the american society have been repressive in regard to its black minority indeed few would disagree with the indictment of the american social svstem leveled by biggers lawyer max that part of the vision which americans have not been able to acceptdespite the recent yearly insurrections in the ghettosis a nation of bigger thomases for whom no hope can be found for whom no peace can come for whom no transcendence is possible save through the flaming armageddon of violent revolution but on another level as james baldwin has pointed out americans have little to fear from bigger thomas the underlying thesis of native son offers hope to the american society if that society will come to the unmistakable conclusion that men live despicable lives of continuous desperation and undertake those programs which by resurrecting bigger thomas will grant salvation to the nation as a whole it is on this level baldwins critique to the contrary that bigger thomas serves as the christ figure the martyr to the hopes of desperate men everywhere the catalytic agent by which a society can be redeemed but hope writes matthew arnold once crushed is less quick to spring anew and the bigger thomas of the s is the embryo of the bigger thomas of the s and s this is not to maintain as wright has been accused of doing that blacks have not made progress in the american society since the s but rather to suggest that progress must be measured not in terms of civil_rights material wealth or governmental appointments but instead in terms of level of consciousness and the awareness by black people of those tremendous forces of which bigger could only conjecturea realization that the human spirit must be free unrestricted by either demagogic men or demagogic institutions wright was among the first to recognize such progress and to create a character who serves as a footnote to black men today those for whom all hope has been dissipated all optimism subsumed under the weight of constant rejection men who see salvation not in terms of resurrecting the society but in dismantling it in toto to produce a social order in which each individual will be the architect of his own destiny the outsider written years after native son is the archetype of the new spiritthe first black character in american fiction to dare all in an existential attempt to stave off personal dehumanization in damon the bridge from bigger thomas to nihilistic man is traversed for by the nature of things such a man sooner or later was bound to appear modem man sleeps in the myths of the greeks and jews those myths are now dying in his head and in his heart they can no longer serve him when they are really gone those myths man returns and whats to guide him nothing at all but his own desires which would be his only values such a vision was totally rejected by americans both black and white a nation of men clutching a dream which has long since become a nightmare for most of its citizens a nation whose people are daily tranquilized by the rhetoric of its leaders portraying a land of freedom promise and opportunity while one tenth of its population knows only misery despair and frustrationis it any wonder that such a nation would be incapable of accepting the existence of a character for whom the society is so degenerate as to produce a savage obsession to destroy everything that society has constructed even wright himself was ambivalent towards this vision he could not accept cross damon as readily as he accepted bigger thomas for it is damon not bigger who is the real monster that aberration as one unkind critic has remarked upon humankind bigger blunders into murder cross skillfully executes it biggers motives are guided by urges beyond his control damons are premeditated each step well calculated bigger desired to create a new identity cross desired no less than to create a new world bigger wants to share in the protestant ethic cross will settle only for an ethic devised by himself bigger is the disgruntled reformer cross is closer to being a nihilist in the camus sense than any character in american fiction a nihilist is not one who believes in nothing writes albert camus he simply does not believe in what exists at the moment and wrights creation but not wright himself could adhere to this philosophy wright believed wholeheartedly in the ethics and values which damon theoretically at leastwanted to destroy and thus wrights most complex character got out of hand refusing to allow his master to resurrect him even at the end of the novel damon remains the prophetic portrait of modernday black men who are putting forth the most nihilistic of questionswhether a nation which continues to physically and mentally murder and maim onetenth of its people has any valid reason for existing wright himself had asked a similar question before in the short story bright and morning star aunt sue is forced to choose between saving her life and that of her son or protecting the movement which is to eventually usher in the new jerusalem over the dying corpse of the old her hatred of the old system is so intense that she chooses in favor of the movement despite the tenuous position upon which the movement rests wright never made such a choice despite periods of overwhelming doubt he remained wedded to the theoretical concepts of western democracy despite his brief excursion into the communist party despite his selfimposed exile he remained convincedas he argued in black_powerthat the survival of western civilization rested upon the coexistence and corecognition of multicultures in which the sanctity of all would be inviolate his vision though often varied remained true to the theme of his earlier writings he saw the possibility of transcendence in the bigger thomases of the nation and he warned america that a nation incapable of putting its ideals into practice would produce cross damons seeking their manhood through a nihilistic attempt to negate the very structure of democracy itself he reaffirmed this thesis in white man listen projecting his vision onto the world arena here he admonished the world powers east and west that at present the wretched of the earth could transcend their conditions only through violence and if this remained the price that men would have to pay for individual freedom then pay it they would this was wrights final message to white men and in light of the turbulence of the past years the message is perhaps already outdated for wright is the last black writer to admonish men to listen today the representatives of that third force which frantz fanon envisioned as moving beyond existentialism to create a world order out of many varied identities no longer seek to communicate with those who continue the oppression begun by their ancestors each day the lines of communication between black man and white man in particular and man and man in general drift wider apart and perhaps the telling mark of the twentieth century is the inability of one man to communicate with another this wright would not have liked he believed always in the community of man and he realized that complete dedication to nihilism would make impossible the building of such a community true then to his basic idealsto those ethics and values hewn out of the violence and terror of those most darkest of southern nights he would still believe even at the time of his death with andre malraux that every man is a mad man but what is a human destiny for if not to unite the mad man with the universe richard wright and i were sitting in a bedroom of the zephyr on the way to nashville tennessee we had for us luxurious accommor dations and we were both enjoying the comfort of the double compartment we had taken off our jackets donned slippers and called the porter for ice and soda to mix drinks it was april in and we had just left chicago on the way to fisk university where dick was to speak to the students and faculty and i was to address the sociology department charles s johnson head of the sociology department had invited us and we traveled in style for the university was paying our expenses dick had been staying with me in chicago for a week filled with parties dinners and meeting people from the university of chicago and members of the institute for psychoanalysis we were both tired and the privacy and comfort of our accommodations suited our mood we sat facing each other before the broad picture window in this deluxe surrounding our drinks on a small table between us the train speeding along wheels clacking a rhythm under us the scenery swirling past in a blur the hoarse mooo of the zephyrs horn swept back over us like drawnout notes of a trombone caught up the clang of bells to warn of a railroad crossing standing in the dust just off the rightofway was an old bentover black man leaning on his cane this zephyr went so fast it swirled papers and stuff into a small tornado whipped his overcoat over his bony frame and rocked him about as we hurtled on down the tracks dick said that old man tell you what hes thinking these white people millions and millions go by and blow smoke and dust in this old mans face and i can hardly get home to cook my grits and beans and side pork they go on and on and i wonder where my family has gone up north someplace but not on that train he could enter the mind of this old man identify with affection and joy but as an artist he could not make such identification or empathize with a white person we were silent awhile the incident enhanced our mood were over the border now dick said were over the old masondixon line in these days crossing the line was a matter of consequence for here formal jim crow came into force nashville isnt too bad for the south i said fisk is an oasis once were on the campus well its okay dinner chimes sounded in the corridor lets eat in the room i suggested i dont feel like putting on shoes and a tie and i dont feel like looking into the faces of a lot of redfaced peckerwoods dick said a solicitous waiter served us excellent steaks and we went to bed earlv the next morning we got up rested both in a good mood i was in the small bathroom shaving what time do we get into nashville dick asked about eleventhirty how about breakfast i can ring for the waiter i thought what the hell weve got a hard day ahead of us but i knew dick would goad me into going to the diner i knew he would persist driven to a new experience in jim crow living which he knew would humiliate and infuriate him how do they segregate you down here i really dont know on this particular train they pull a curtain or something i honestly dont know for sure lets go try it i slammed the razor stuff into the small cabinet and stepped into the compartment look weve got this bedroom lets call a waiter god i dont need to go through everything to know how it feels but he goaded me because he had driven himself to experience this thing i didnt want to weasel out to be a coward and besides i was curious too i took my jacket from the hanger okay lets go we had to walk through three cars down narrow passageways bumping into other passengers the train rocking over its uneven roadbed we came to the diner at the kitchen and pantry end and stood waiting in line to be seated the white steward moved from one end of the car to the other seating people as they came in he glanced at us two two i said other people crowded behind us the steward looked over our shoulders and said three onefour he seated these people right away then others and in the meantime i knew we were going to be seated in one or the other of the end tables nearest the pantry the pantry where the waiters set up their trays call thjr orders fill their water pitchers and coffee pots didnt i know how many times had i as a waiter crowded into that hot little space these tables are the most undesirable in in the dining car the jim crow section i recognized as the four and the deuce tables nearest the pantry they were occupied by whites we waited the people at the four soon finished our waiter rushed up to stack the dishes he was short stout darkbrown sweat was popping out in beads on his lined face i poked dick and said were getting special attention you know that i laughed but inside me i spilled obscenities in every language i knew against these whites i heard my voice crack as i said see theyre getting our table ready for us you know dick were really special he lit a cigarette ran his eyes the length of the diner with a detached clinical look like a surgeon preparing to remove the guts of a dying man nobody will be seated at that four its killed i told dick you see the regulations are strict evervthing according to rule nothing crude theyve got a standard i know this station the waiter has certain duties look at him build up steam poor bastard he doesnt want to lose money from his white passengers on his station but he doesnt want to lose money on us either he wants to serve us but hes caught up in the whole goddamned system and must play his role the waiter began to clear the four then the deuce was empty the steward said just a minute sir getting to you aside he whispered to the harassed waiter clear the deuce not knowing i understood the lingo the waiter snarled im going as fast as i can youre putting me up a tree he picked up a tray of dirty dishes and muttered dont put me up a tree returning from the pantry the waiter whipped our table into shape tossed the clean cloth on the table laid down the gleaming silver the whole setup the steward with visible relief seated us dick slipped into the chair against the wall facing the whole dining car and i was seated opposite him it was magic as i sat down the steward slipped behind me as though to pull out my seat to give me splendid service and with one smooth movement of his arm slid the curtain behind me right to the edge of our table magic with the grace of a ballet dancer the steward moved across to the four straightened the one rose in the slender vase and with the same economy of movement reached up and swished the curtain across the back of that table that table was dead they could not fill it there were not that many negroes on the train this waiters tips would suffer he was getting it in the neck along with us i didnt know what to tip him no use to ask dickhe wouldnt know or care the steward gave us our mealchecks menus a polite smile bow and left the waiter served us well when we had finished eating the steward came to total our checks he spoke to the waiter and now that the pressure was gone the black mans voice his demeanor his entire personalityhad gone through a metamorphosis as we lingered over coffee dick said did you notice that waiter when he talked to the steward yeah sure poor black devil his voice went up two octaves and his testicles must have jumped two inches into his stomach yes i guess so dick persisted he does that to emasculate himself to make himself more feminine less masculine more acceptable to a white man it was so obvious so shockingly true and so graphically stated that i laughed oh hell dont probe his guts youre right but youre spoiling my breakfast i complained a four days later we boarded the train looking forward to the ease of a compartment for it had been a frantic and hectic time at fisk and we were exhausted we thought we had a bedroom but dis w covered a mixup in our reservations we complained vigorously but had to settle for an upper and lower berth we flipped and dick won so i climbed to the upper berth in the middle of the night i got up to go to the john and as i climbed down the ladder i noticed a light through the curtain dick was lying on the bed fully clothed except for his jacket reading a book what the hell arent you going to sleep i inquired when im below the masondixon line i want more between me and white people than a curtain i want iron and steel richard wright was a decisive incisive powerful intellectual giant a prophetic writer he is being rediscovered for wright dealt with the major issues and questions of all timeswith the deep meaning of mans existence with the nature of the feelings thoughts and emotions of oppressed people with mans inhumanity to man the cast of wrights characters were black but the plot is eternal was life simply fever feeling without knowing seeking without finding he grew thin and his eyes held the red blood of his body after this anguished question felt by bigger thomas and this vivid expression of the failure and turning inward of his sensory yearnings native son closes with an interchange between the condemned man and his lawyer max that has never been completely analyzed a close comparison with albert camus existentialist novelette the strangerincluding such related images as droning and stuttering such related characters as camus priest and wrights preacher and such related themes as knowledgethroughdeath and the artificiality of all courtroom trialswould advance the critical establishment toward a professionally full understanding of book three especially native son has had many admirers for thoroughly defensible reasons its racial passion and sociological and psychological richness so complement wrights other signal achievementsblack boy and uncle toms children among othersthat none of a succeeding generation of black novelists has been able to replace him in the esteem of his fellow writers the excellence of wrights work however still needs to be minutely analyzed the phrase protest literature no matter what adjectives surround it reveals almost nothing of the permanent virtues of native sonalthough those virtues are profoundly anchored in blackness in racial oppression and in the militant spirit of the author native son is a novel of remarkable agony individualized in bigger thomas yet universalized in ways grievously recognizable over a quarter of a century later on almost every page by negro readers especially the question of how the author transmitted such power and truth should have been perfectly answered by now to observe that wright suffered keenly from racism and wrote feelingly about his experiences is merely to repeat what might equally be said of many black writers wrights racial fire is widely known and it has long warmed a race in need of strong voices the still challenging question however is literary by what verbal techniques did the author help bigger thomas make the reader peep through his knothole in the fence and understand his feelings about his existence bigger did not want to die without being understood by somebody and richard wright has bequeathed one large means of understanding each bigger thomas among us the very thing that bigger hungered for after his capture that vast configuration of images and symbols whose magic and power could lift him up and make him live so intensely that the dread of being black and unequal would be forgotten it is more than aestheticism that argues the value of images and symbols in biggers life largely existential in his perceptions bigger knows himself and his environment most surely through images when despairing he sees his life as an obscene joke happening amid a colossal din of siren screams and white faces and circling lances of light under a cold and silken sky when bigger is walking with bessie his mind could feel the soft swing of her body a young man consumed always with a body hunger sensitive bigger is vulnerable even to a ray of sunshine in his cell near the end of the novel a shaft of yellow sun cut across his chest with as much weight as a beam forged of lead with a convulsive gasp he bent forward and shut his eyes he yearns for wholeness of experiencemade possible only when his feelings merge with some equivalent object around hima yearning graphically portrayed when lying on his cot in jail biggers hands were groping fumblingly through the city of men for something to match the feelings smoldering in him viewed internally as a conflict of forces he is physically a centrally expanding impulse always throbbing but seldom countered by anything outside of him to meet it and explain it the symbolic cast of biggers mind is often made clear for example while he hides in an empty building a chunk of bread in his pocket and his gun nestled under his shirt against his chest are described as symbolic of his rejection of folk religion biggers tragedy his abortive sense of power a power born of a latent capacity to live is made palpable to the reader primarily through the sharing of his many images charged with terror native son then enables the reader to live with a black man of feeling in the truest sense of the phrase a young american whose specific ambition is to merge himself with others and be a part of this world to lose himself in it so he could find himself to be allowed a chance to live like others even though he was black the constant frustration of that simple ambition and of the feelings supporting it is the psychological substance of the novel the network of images that most authentically attend that daily frustrationand their personal racial and national significanceis the jamesian stuff of consciousness to be conveyed a few miscellaneous techniques serving that end might be briefly mentioned images of light and dark as expected recur frequently without special emphasis the light in the dalton house is hardly ever ratural it is a bright flood in the kitchen a room important in racial history is dim elsewhere in the home and is hallucinatory and glaring in the semihuman furnace images of snow often suggest biggers complex connectionsincluding aesthetic oneswith the white world when he leaps from the daltons window after the discovery of marys bones for example the shock of his fall went through him up his back to his head and he lay buried in a cold pile of snow dazed snow was in his mouth eyes ears snow was seeping down his back a related type of imagery temperature contrasts such as biggers despairing wonder about the warm red blood here and cold blue sky there marks the protagonists awareness of paradox in his surroundings natural images of those surroundings used for the sake of sensory appeal unrelated to biggers mood of the moment occur fewer than five times in the whole novel other images of nature are even more rarely thematic and the exception is interesting after bessies murder bigger lifted her feeling the wind screaming a protest against him finally what might be called intestinal imagery is skillfully used the repeated image of marys severed head urgent in biggers feelings rather than merely sensational on the page catches fully the ambivalence and sensory horror that drive him similarly effective are pictures of the demonic furnace with its muffled breathing of the fire the furnace emphatically described about times stands in the middle range of key images found in native son that almost living demandingtobefed gorge whispers and sucks in its air as bigger sucks in air during his many moments of fearful tension and no air can get through the furnace while bigger stands breathless before the imminent discovery of marys bones her earring and the hatchet blade the full identification of the furnace activities with biggers own bodily sensations was incipient earlier when he neared collapse after sticking his ransom note under the daltons door a wave of numbness spread fanwise from his stomach over his entire body making his mouth gap here the furnace mouth that bigger has often peeked anxiously into becomes his own mouth and the fanshaped grate of glowing coals becomes his burning stomach later as the incredulous newsman pokes at the bones in the furnace ashes bigger himself was a huge furnace now through which no air could go and the fear that surged into his stomach was like the fumes of smoke that had belched from the ash bin and as bigger runs from the house the inside of his stomach glowed whitehot the identification persists as bigger notices newspaper headlines while walking to bessies room resenting the failure of newsmen to take any interest in his storymeaning his very lifeas long as it had remained buried and burning in his own heart a rather peculiar image reminiscent of its striking usage by chekhov in ward no occurs slightly more often than that of the furnace the picture of an excited bigger standing in the middle of the floor he leaps to this position at bessies when he wonders if he can trust her and when he wonders if the police are questioning his family at that very moment he takes the same stance in his own room when he discovers that he has forgotten to burn his incriminating gloves pencil and paper and he moves to the center of his jail cell when he is excited about the revelations of his first long talk with his lawyer max and again minutes later when he first tries to see himself in relation to other men the meaning of these postures is specified when bigger fearfully embarrassed by the addition of his servile family and friends to the ranks of staring white people the whole cast of the novel already standing in his cell was so tense in body and mind that when the door swung in he bounded up and stood in the middle of the room this peculiar image then pictorially frames some of biggers moments of maximum tension and freezes him at the point of maximum flight within areas that restrict his movement or thought daily trapped in corners and pockets on chicagos south side at crucial instants bigger needs spaceat least that semblance of it represented by equidistance and centrality a subtler geometric pattern comparable to effects achieved by nathaniel hawthorne in the marble faun emerges when bigger appears at the center of another figure the christian cross at the inquest with one policeman on each side of him and with two in front and two behind totaling six and therefore matching the number of jurors bigger moves ironically at the center of a cross afterwards speeding through the streets toward the dalton home for a bullying interrogation bigger rides with one officer seated on each side of him and with six police cars in front and a similar string behind carried thus is the middle of an elongated crucifix realistically adjusted to the spatial restrictions of traffic while bigger is resisting in the dalton home the imposition of a false charge of rape he confuses a cross being burned atop a building on the other side of the street with the cross recently hung around his neck by his mothers minister reverend hammond thinking that a holy cross should not be burned but hearing outside the cries burn im and kill im bigger suddenly knows that he is not looking at the cross of christ but the cross of the ku klux klan he had a cross of salvation round his throat and they were burning one to tell him that they hated him just as his body had metaphorically become the furnace it becomes the cross when a jailer attributes his rebellion against the religious symbol to communist dogma thats a goddamn lie bigger shouted his body seemed a flaming cross as words boiled hysterically out of him after bigger throws his cross awav three times the au w thors condensed metaphor shows the meaning of these several pages in book three bigger reflects that the cross the preacher had hung round his throat had been burned in front of his eyes wright takes pains with less noticeable images such is the case with his depiction of eyes as emblems of blindness and guilt exclusive of his many pictures of the blind mrs dalton strangely liberated by his accidental murder of mary bigger thinks about nearby people waiting for street cars he did not look at them they were simply blind people blind like his mother his brother his sister peggy britten jan mr dalton and the sightless mrs dalton and the quiet empty houses with their black gaping windows those blind houses in the ghetto according to biggers feelings have stares like that of the daltons white cat that leaped upon his shoulder in front of photographers in the basement when marys bones were discovered its big round black eyes twin pools of secret guilt and like that of the murdered bessie staring at him with those round large black eyes her bloody mouth open in awe and wonder and pain to a person like bigger his life reduced to occasional sensory joys snuffed out by a constant overbalance of pain images of the corruption of the eyehis only receptor of magnitudewould disturbingly crowd his mind two kinds of images are thematically as well as numerically impressive in native son each found in various passages between fifteen and twenty times the type discernible slightly less often the blotout image shares the powers of physical violence upon its initial appearance the day bigger first comes to drexel boulevard and wants to wave his hand and blot out mr dalton for making him feel embarrassed or failing in that to blot himself out using the same or quite similar words bigger wants to blot out a number of people and things before the novel ends this list of people includes negroes because they never act in unity catching the i mind and body in certainty and faith whites because they are measuring every inch of his weakness and all the people at the inquest because they look at and cause him to look at bessies corpse but biggers destructive impulse as made known through this kind of image is usually aimed elsewhere it is aimed for example at inactivity planning the ransom note he does not need to dance and sing and clown over the floor in order to blot out a day and night of doing nothing it is aimed at sound blotted out by the roaring noise in his ears for instance when he hates britten so hard and hot for being a bigot at fear blotted out by his sudden confidence when he eats breakfast with his family and thinks of how blind they were and at death itself a different and bigger adversary than the white mountain of vengeful society in a reversal of this variety of imagery white society itself becomes an arbitrary agent of the blottingout impulse surrounding bigger for it feels that nothing short of a quick blotting out of his life would make the city safe again all of society colludes in such destruction points out max your honor injustice blots out one form of life but another grows up in it place with its own rights needs and aspirations max himself however his hat jammed on his head in that subtle last scene of the novel has in effect blotted out of his head all the words from bigger that he did not want to hear those expressions of the black prisoners superior humanity that outdistanced communist dogma the other kind of image thematic in native son with about equal frequency is the white blur and its variant forms biggers certainty of the color and his uncertainty regarding the substance of these sense impressions invest them with a degree of pathos and irony blind mrs dalton always dressed in white both a victim and an object of faulty external perception is typically a white blur standing by the door silent ghostlike other people pictorially share her color and meaning while bigger stands bewildered by his discovery that he has killed mary a vast city of white people blurs the reality of the room while viewing his picture in the newspaper in which the white cat perches accusingly on his shoulder bigger feels that the whole vague white world would track him down and while he is being cruelly dragged and cursed and stamped in the snow he dimly sees around him an array of faces white and looming an implicit image of the white blur and a source of monumental frustration in bigger thomas and in many of his progenyis voiced by max who tells the judge that the prisoner had no notion before he murdered and he has none now of having been wronged by any spe cific individuals material objects in the white world also appear as blurs the reader slowly realizes that the whiteowned cars that whirred over the smooth black asphalt shot past them at high speed and zoomed past on swift rubber tires early in the novel have been varicolored forerunners of the white blur when images like the white flash of a dozen silver bulbs occur the mass image of the newsmen in the basement has a manifold significance a reversal like that observed in the blotout images appears in the use of the white blur states attorney buckley himself part of the white blur urges the death penalty to enable whites to sleep in peace tonight to know that tomorrow will not bring the black shadow of death over the homes and lives the sentence of death brings another reversal a counter image to biggers perception as he understands every word while reacting only to the judges white face his eyes not blinking the blur now disappears from the language of the novel clarified by its own revealed deadlinessto recur implicitly and indirectly only once transformed into a new adversary for bigger the opaqueness in the mind of max that blurs his deeper awareness of his client by far the most numerous and the most meaningful wrights closely related images of the wall and the curtain widely distributed in over fifty separate passages in native son deserve a closer study than is possible here but their categories thirteen in number at least can be indicated when ranked according to frequency of usage the wallcurtain as a shield of indifference and detachment emphasized in eleven different passages is predominant on the first morning of the novel bigger has lurked behind his curtain of indifference snapping and glaring at whatever had tried to make him come out into the open several such images cluster on the pages describing biggers capture where the reader sees him trapped on the icy water tank going behind his curtain his wall looking out with sullen stares of contempt behind his curtain now looking down at himself freezing under the impact of water in subzero winds and when his fingers are too stiff to pick up his gun something laughed in him cold and hard he was laughing at himself the final such image in the novel is especially interesting biggers eyes were wide and unseeing his voice rushed on as he explains to max important things about his life and recent actions that max really does not want to hear bigger is walling max out of his perceptions so that he bigger can better gauge with his feelings whether his own tone is carrying his meaning it had been maxs tone in court not his words that had made him believe that max knew how he felt a category of wallcurtain images used somewhat less often and used negatively is one reflecting or the artificial separation of certain classes of people bigger for classes of people bigger for example rides in the front seat of the dalton car between two vast white looming walls mary and jan the suggestion of protectiveness in this kind of image disappears from the novel after white but honest jan has approached bigger flung aside the curtain and walked into the room of his life a passage important also for its metaphor showing biggers life as a room and therefore enhancing the meaning of every wallcurtain image thus reversed the image later pictures bigger trying to break down walls to reach other people one of the most gratifying passages in the novel employs such an image when the prisoner wonders whether if his hands were electric wires and his heart a battery and if he reached out through these stone walls and felt other hands would there be a reply a shock not that he wanted those hearts to turn their warmth to him but just to know that they were there and warm and in that touch response of recognition there would be union identity a wholeness which had been denied him all his life similarly moved by his new insight bigger wonder how he can break down this wall of isolation between him and max whom he now sees upon another planet far off in space and he apprehensively tells max that maybe the wall between him and other men will still be there when he is executed ill be feeling and thinking that they didnt see me and i didnt see them an early expression of ralph ellisons invisible man theme the remaining subdivisions of the wallcurtain image spread throughout approximately passages need not be illustrated by more excerpts to document the variety and authenticity in this area of wrights style nevertheless the following list of the subdivisions ranked again according to their frequency of use should be informative the other figurative walls and curtains then vividly represent the suppression of certain feelings hatred resentment and mistrust the stunting or perversions of intelligence and imagination the withering of familial and friendly affection the ineffectiveness of certain barriers the deprivation of fundamental human needs natural barriers entrapment deceit defensive counterfeelings and the acceptance of certain isolation a knowledge of all the images in native son does not produce automatically a knowledge of bigger thomas and bigger himself feels more than he thinks concluding at last existentially that his feelings are the surest guide to truth and to morality but when i think of why all the killing was he says apparently including all the fancied killings of his life i begin to feel what i wanted what i am to know what and why a man desires and to know what he is is the deepest human engagement of our faculties the furnace the trembling poise in the middle of the room the crucifix the haunting blind eyes the wish to blot out the white blur of the hater and avenger and the looming wall so massively effective and yet so useless and wrongall these images metaphorically dramatize part of the black mans american experience and native son preserves them for us to feel and to believe perhaps not knowing wright makes it possible for me to evaluate his works objectively certainly we know of his influence on baldwin george lamming and others ralph ellison is not the least of these one has only to compare ellisons invisible man the start of it to wrights short story the man who lived underground it has been reported more than once that ellison admitted his debt to wright this has always been reported secondhand ellison himself to my knowledge has never done it in public i found pagan spain to be one of wrights most perceptive books and frequent travelers to spain would do well to read it if it can be found wright had no particular stake in spain except as a human being interested in the plight of other human beings this marked a very special growth i think and it is the kind of growth all black writers must move towardfrom the burning consideration of the black oppressed to the final consideration of all oppressed peoples in the final analysis it is this consideration that makes wright the most important black writer american of all times it is after all amusing to reread wright and to find that he has said so succinctly if not always quite correctly but with the awesome power he employed what so many of us are trying clumsily to say today it really makes you want to quit trying he has said it all so well who among the current crop have been so bold as to explore the ramifications of racism in america europe africa and asia no one there is one final consideration now that wright is dead how we line up to celebrate his gifts now that he offers us no competition how wonderful he was we say the prejudice and discrimination in publishing makes us jealous of the tiny and very dispensable positions we hold in it only we can change that and i suggest that in memory of richard wright we cease scuffling amongst ourselves to attain what in the end is illusory anyway to the very end of his days as great as he was wright was pressed for bread demeaningly pressed for it if things go on as they are the end will be the same for each and every one of us lets change them lets salute next time the living like chester himes before he goes without our best wishes admiration and a medal with a field of collard greens rampant and chitlins diagonal for having written the good fight if others care to assume my mental stance and through empathy duplicate the atmosphere in which i speak wrote p richard wright in one of his last books white man listen cfd gm they can imaginatively grasp the factors in my environment and a sense of the impulses motivating me they will if they are of a mind be able to see more or less what ive seen will be capable of apprehending the same general aspects and tones of reality that comprise my world part of the reality that comprised his world at the time the words were written was the experience of some thirty years in the united states a decade in paris and travel in parts of europe africa asia and latin america all of it had given him a focus that few black americans at the time tried to accept or understand either for the benefit of ourselves the world or for richard wright and many whites have not accepted or tried to understand it since he was before his time and as all men who break forth with the truth before the world seems to be ready for it he sufferedchided misunderstood accused of abandoning america and its racial problem for another orbit dying finally before some of the predictions he made about the future would come true his death in at the beginning of a decade in transition for america africa and asiaall three about which he had written so muchbrought the end of a literary career that had produced published books innumerable poems short stories essays book reviews dramatic works and speeches in the late forties he had chosen to take leave of the u s the country in which he had been a secondclass citizen but where in his own way he had always been one step ahead together with his wife and young daughter he now finally left it all behind before leaving he had written five books depicting americas racial situation the american decade that followedbringing mccarthyism the korean war the eisenhower era and the long overdue supreme court desegregation ruling of was one in which because he had once been a communist he would have been made to suffer but perhaps with a gift of prophecy the mccarthy days found him away interpreting the racial situation in other areas he was in bandung writing his own analysis on the future of asia and africa and in africa making notes for a book on the colonial heritage of the gold coast ghana his book on africa in black_power antedated by years the two words stokely carmichael turned into a now famous phrase and told of kwame nkrumah before most of the world had heard of him or could pronounce his name he took his family off to paris during a period when he and his jewish wife ellen could not without harassment and embarrassment rent property in new yorks greenwich village or buy it in new england when lynchings in the south were still not uncommon when jim crowism in the south and in many places in the north was still written into law and when he was the preeminent black figure in american letters not only because he was talented but because only one black writer at a time especially in richard wrights time could be eminent in american letters he had been forced to become a spokesman for a black population of then people all the conditions of living and writing in such an atmosphere had become too much finallyafter first one visit to france in followed by a brief return to the united states then a decision to go to france soon after to liveexile became the answer from his first departure until the appearance of the outsider in no new book from richard wright would come for eight years the last to be published before it would be his autobiographical black boy in the interim years as seen later were crucial to a new phase of his career and some of the most valuable if the least acclaimed of his works would come after this period of silence ellen wright the late authors widow told me in paris in during an informal talk about the writers work my husband didnt write for almost seven years he was reading then were her affectionate and rather quiet wordshe was reading reading reading his silence in a way that silence can be golden gave him a new psychological distance and perspective that some black americansthose who have it and have revealed ithave come to usually in only one of three ways through serving as we would discover through malcolm_x time in prison or by going as ralph ellisons invisible man did in a sense underground or as with richard wright by living for a time in exile it does not usually happen by living in the mainstream of american life but by living outside it out of the period of richard wright in parismidway between africa and americahe emerged to reveal not only what it meant to be a black american but the meaning of being a black man in the western world and with this discovery he probed not only himself and his past but the western psychein a way that no black writer in the u s had ever probed it or been able to probe it or in quite the same way has probed it since he knew and understood what slavery had done in america and he discovered what colonialism had done in africa and asiaa lesson which american history hiding both the legend of slave revolts and the colonial west had not wholly taught him he learned it himself and nearly a decade after his death that same lesson is being taught now only because the independence of africa and asia the war in vietnam and a new black militancy have all made it a lesson which can no longer be ignored he became as men in exile do a cultural interloper living between two worlds and as a black man africa inevitably would become part of one or both those worlds to come face to face with this reality is to assume loyalty to one world or the other or to become a neutral and richard wright in his outlook and stance from all indications had become something of the lattera neutral man though were he living now it might well have changed but in in white man listen he would tell us im not nonwestern im no enemy of the west neither am i an easterner when i look out upon those vast stretches of this earth inhabited by brown black and yellow mensections of the earth in which religion dominates to the exclusion of everything else the emotional and mental landscapemy reactions and attitudes are those of the west i see both worlds from another and third point of view to set his later work beside that of frantz fanon or the later web du bois after his expatriation of ghana wright by comparison is neither a panafricanist nor a revolutionary and to some black american militants for whom fanon has become both hero and revolutionary example wright today would not quite offer the same appeal both writers died within a year of the otherwright at in and fanon at in and it is impossible not in some way to compare their messages as quite different whereas wright three years before his death would pen the words the west must aid and yes abet the delicate and tragic elite in asia and establish national areas of living fanon was telling us at almost the same time though he would not until much later be translated into english as for us who have decided to break the back of colonialism our historic mission is to sanction all revolts all desperate actions all those abortive attempts in rivers of blood neither man however spared the newly liberated bourgeois african who was the first to exploit the masses at the end of colonial rule but wright unlike fanon despite what some may argue and what richard wright may have believed himself to be was no revolutionary in the sense that like fanon he preached and sanctioned global revolt wright a forerunner on paper courageous and the father of the black american literary revolution had few contemporary rivals but his work when put beside that of some black american writers today would be considered mild in tone and message to say the least but it was he who as a kind of franctireur of the black literary vanguard had given us the first warningwho years before the report from the presidents commission on civil disorders was ever thought of had presented to us all that it could ever say with his native son and before the first signs of neocolonialism would appear along with what some now call wars of liberation occurring in countries of third world he was trying to give the message of how to avoid holocaust with white man listen exile had made him at one with himself much of the outspoken state of rage and the tone of protest is absent from his later essays and rather than a polemicist he had become a social critic in residence and travel abroad he saw and understood the three ms of western collusion as he called themmissionaries merchants and mercenariesand he spoke out against them but he had come to believe essentially in mans humanity to man that the west might finally end up being less selfish than it had been for years that the future offered hope however he became in spite of it all in the end one of the most misunderstood black writers of all time he was finally criticized by africans who believed he had misinterpreted africa and flayed also by many american blacks who insisted he had lost touch with the american reality whatever that means in a country which then as now has reality defined by hollywood television madison avenue public relations and two political parties so similar as to be indistinguishable and if he was misunderstood by blacks he was resented as much as a black man could ever be resented by countless whites those who could accept uncle toms children native son bright and morning star twelve million black voices and black boy but could not have a black man tamper with the western myth in literature as in life if white critics could have their way he was to keep his placewrite about what it was like to be black in mississippi or on the south side of chicago and leave the moral judgments about africa asia and socalled western civilization to the white civilizers he had turned his back on the american dream and gone into exile and the white literary establishment began to drop him and politically he would learn that a black american abroad was to be anything but an independent international voice having any overtones of politics if any speaking or writing about america or western policy was to be done it was supposed to be done on a state department tour his travels however produced books inspired them and brought speeches between trips to africa and asia he traveled widely in spain a country he admitted having ignored because of franco and fascism but finally visited at the advice of gertrude stein who shortly before her death told him in paris what he later wrote in pagan spain dick you ought to go to spain youll see the past there youll see what the western world is made of he saw in spain much of what he saw in africa and asia the reasons christianity had been able to triumph why it could do so over one people and not another and why spain still bound by religious traditions of the th century and by an unquestioning conscience had permitted religion for four centuries to overlap every facet of spanish life he found it like no other country in europe in the th century and he named it pagan spain where james baldwin would tell us what it felt like as a black man to gaze at the cathedral of chartres or to look upon his past in a way that made him despise black people because they had failed to produce rembrandt richard wright would give us the foibles and contradictions of how western mankind lived religion and race and the meaning of tradition played a greater role in his interpretation of europe africa and asia than politics or economics although in apropos preposessions an introduction to black_power he noted he would use throughout the book a marxist analysis of the historical events that had transpired throughout the last five centuries in one part of africa he analyzed finally more through the doctrines of race and religion than through marxist ideology much the same approach is to be found in pagan spain white man listen and a book on the meeting of afroasian nations in indonesia which he entitled in the colour curtain a report on the bandung conference made obvious in his work is his own knowledge that he traveled through countries as an outsider marginally he saw what insiders are not in a position to see and he showed us what no european no asian or no african traveling in the same places could interpret in quite the same way he had acquired as outsider a double vision and he knew it this double vision of mine he wrote in white man listen stems from my being a product of western civilization and for my racial identity long and deeply conditioned this condition of being born western and a man of color creates a psychological distance so to speak between me and my environment at bandung at what he called the meeting of the rejected he was present as a westerner and man of color who had known rejection i feel my life has given me some keys he wrote in the colour curtain to what they would say or do im an american negro as such ive had a burden of race consciousness and like many of those from the nations represented he had a religious background and had been a communist out of the bandung trip came a document encompassing asia africa the left the right race religion communism and all the values of the western world and for all the reasons it was unique he would have trouble finding a publisher the dutch and french did not want it for reasons which need no explanation his own american publisher harpers refused it publication came finally in england as thesiswhether one agrees or not with its presentationit is to be recognized as courageous courageously attempted and courageously written the bandung conference scorned by most of the western world as its judgment day found the then u s secretary referring to it on the american news media before it happened as the socalled afroasian conference and with the approaching united states role in vietnam where american advisors at the time of bandung were already moving in swiftly behind the french it was no doubt judged at the time by many as too political a book for an american author to write or to have writtenespecially if he was black an expatriate and had once been an avowed communist for all the control he had over his life and times richard wright was an honest writer but as a black man living in exile in the capital of the western world his intellectual honesty for all its intent could not be quite as complete as the desire for it before his death he had lived years in francethe france of a colonial policy in asia and africa the france which had fought to keep indochina french at dienbienphu and battled to crush algerian nationalists in setif kabylia and algiers and though the history of french colonial policy was to be deemed no better or worse than that of the british whom he admonished in black_power the same author who traveled to bandung one year after dienbienphu and had lived in france throughout the algerian war had watched french colonialism go down unwillingly and in defeat and he had remained silent about it but unless part of his life was to become a contradiction he had little other choice through no fault of his own part of the paradox of black americans living in western countries with a colonial history is that to remain silent about it implies a complicity in it for lack of choice rather than complicity as wright showed silence is usually the result but if as camus once wrote by our silence or the stand we take we too enter the fray richard wright for lack of choice had unwillingly entered the fray he had not chosen to be born a westerner it had been thrust upon him and he had been as much westerner in america with its stain of slavery as in europe with its blot of colonialism but unlike fanon who a black french citizen from martinique could attack the french renounce citizenship and did preaching revolution against the french richard wright black american expatriate in france man with a passport but no longer really with a country was doomed to silence about french colonial policy lest he become an unwelcome alien on adopted soil for the moral and intellectual dilemma in which he would inevitably find himself but which he never admitted the french with a history of such moral dilemma long ago introduced the word for it richard wright would become a man in engrenage caught up unwillingly in a situation in which there was little choice but the same choice he had believed himself though essentially a free manan alien liberated on foreign soilunbound by tradition habit culture or country and in a way that he never quite revealedthough it is between the lines of his later workliving in europe had contributed to a mental state of freedom in more ways than being free from racial oppression no longer forced to live by the values of american society nor responsible to think or act according to the traditions of europe and economically independent he was free to create his own values becoming as free perhaps as a black man could ever be free as a citizen of the western world the freedom which gave him his double vision permeated his nonfiction but in fiction neither vision nor freedom would be quite as complete for the same reasons he had acquired freedom in nonfiction he revealed in fiction what can happen to the black writer as foreigner cut off from the sources of the past remembering but no longer living them his characters became cultural interlopers in no work of fiction written abroad during yearsinclusive of short stories of which there were fewer than novelsdid he penetrate european life or but barely bring any of his characters into it the first novel written in europe the outsider is set alternately in chicago harlem and greenwich village the second savage holiday all of whose characters are white and american has a setting in new york city the third the long dream his last published novel and the first in which he attempted to bring a character into french lifebut has him arriving and going no furtheris the story of fishbelly who decides to leave his native mississippi where the storys action is set and takes a plane for paris in writing what he knew bestmississippi chicago harlem and greenwich village all places he had livedhe did what most black writers who go to paris to live and write do not usually choosing paris as a place to write about the varied works of chester himes and james baldwin written there to name only two are other examples of it wright used paris and mentioned other european locales in his fiction in the way that most american writers have as a backdrop a mood but not a way of life for it to be otherwise is by necessity to have plunged into european life learned its language and its ways in order to transform the experience into fiction if not an american just as wright did writes only of americans in europe a character comes goes but never comes aliveor as with his fishbelly only arrives and because to become more than a foreigner and an onlooker in europe takes time and worktime and work which if one is writing for a livelihood as was richard wright is time which must be spent writingwhat usually comes into american fiction is what he brought the past rather than the present for some black americans to do otherwise as may have also happened to richard wright is an obstacle for both personal and racial reasons to enter the life of europe rather than remain on the periphery to master a foreign language requires submission by its nature to be forced to learn everything over again to do in rome as the romans do accustomed to doing at home in the white mans world some black americans are abroad to escape it rather than enter into it in any way even if not for the same reasons they thus remain outside in the company of each othergathering in favorite cafes keeping company with others who seek the same existing in an expatriate colony richard wright shortly before his death had written a novel island of halluci nation as a sequel to fishbelly on the paris expatriate colony of the fifties the story of its infiltration by espionage agents many of them blacks spying on blacks for the cia his american publisher never took it without a doubt he knew the inner life of the america expatriate colony in paris better than he probably ever realized except for close friends the french he was married to an american lived as an american american familystyle speaking english he read in english probably more often than not and wrote in english and it is more likely that to a worldfamous writer french friends conversed with him in english more often than he was called upon to put his thoughts to them into french the french the most xenophobic of all europeans toward foreignersother than his close friends and the companionship of french intellectuals among them sartre and simone de beauvoirwere not the easiest people for him to know his whole experience abroad however seemed to affect his work in one way or another and much of it a period of adaptability as painful as writing he had undertaken as he would discover himself the most difficult task for a writer to pull up roots in one place and transplant them in another and still turn out valuable work and for a black writer even as prolific as richard wright the experience would not be the same as for ernest hemingway gertrude stein f scott fitzgerald or some lesser american writers who also chose exileand have since been eulogized in a way that wright never has whether at his death he found his exile worth it we will never really know it is more likely he did but those who choose exile dont usually tell us otherwise had he been a less important literary figure or as some american writers who have gone to europe unknown and subsequently become known the issue might not count for so much but rather than an obscure talent he was a major american author who chose europe not only as a place to write but also to spend the rest of his life and whatever he produced later would be judged accordingly unlike james baldwin a relatively unknown writer until he came home to america richard wrights career assumed another burden to compare the works of baldwin and wright as simply two black american writers who lived in paris at the same time is not important they are too different to make an important comparison except that this viewer has for a long time maintained that much of the commercial american success of james baldwin was somewhat due to his attack upon richard wright in part also to his return home which wright even for burial had chosen not to do and because those who set standards of giving titular head to black writers for public consumption elected to give it to james baldwin at wrights death had baldwin remained in europe longer than his year duration he might still be unknown to the american reading public upon his return to america he had written already three books and the fourth published soon after his return nobody knows my name was probably the most fitting title that might have been chosen if for no other reason than to compare the works of baldwin and wright as two black writers who lived abroad there is the necessity to compare them as they now seem to appear during this day when black has achieved an unparalleled vogue in the american popularity syndromeinclusive of writers books on sale if the two are compared as two black writers both equally famous some distinct differences become apparent on the commercial market as to who is being promoted and who isnt the works of james baldwin are all presently available in paperback the works of richard wright in paperback are uncle toms children native son and black boy the only work written abroad paperback or otherwise presently available is white man listen none of the rest are for sale at all but are out of print that wright is dead and baldwin alive would appear as a consequence except that many more american writers dead long before wright are far more accessible in american libraries and bookstores his complete works appear to be available now only in private collections at the schomburg collection in harlem and in the moreland room of howard university the library of congress might also be a complete source except black_power has been omitted from its card catalogue it is known that his later books were not well received in america though most were being translated into foreign languages and accepted well abroad toward wrights downward slide in the united states james baldwin attempted to add what could only appear as a final push he had already made an attempt with everybodys protest novel in notes of a native son during wrights lifetime but it looked as if finally he had been told that to become king of the jungle is to first kill the lion what he did was to throw the corpse of a man who had befriended him to the lions his now famous alas poor richard nobody knows my name after wrights death was probably his greatest literary coup with the establishment outside publication of letter from a region in my mind published as part of the fire next time in the madison avenueminded the new yorker as an example of how far he went with that establishment and how far wright didnt go this writer who had both the good fortune and misfortune of working for the new yorker some years ago suggested in as a possible story for talk of the town that the magazine do a conversation with ellen wright then in new york city for the first time in years and visiting the u s especially for the march on washington the new yorker editor william shawn answered with a polite but abject no encircled with his initial and that was that james baldwin could appear in the magazine book length but a conversation with the widow of richard wright no over a year later in paris i personally interviewed the authors widow myself for a swedish newspaper she had words then on among other subjects james baldwin and the alas poor richard essay they are perhaps more apropos here since she wanted known what her husband was no longer alive or in america to say the disagreements baldwin writes of she said were onesided my husband never indulged in public criticism or open arguments with james baldwin he always considered him baldwin a valuable contribution with the makings of a major talent everything baldwin had to say of him he wright said time and events will settle the course its just unfortunate that certain statements baldwin has made date since the death of richard wright and that they seem an attempt to change his image and create a new one posthumously it is doubtful that the image of richard wright could be affected permanently through the work of james baldwin although the effort seems to have been made more than not that the content and perhaps the volume of the late authors work would have been different had he never left the united states there is no longer any question it would have been different in the way byrons would have been had he never left england joyces had he never left ireland or henry james had he never left america he never produced in a vacuum but he left america and he didnt return he was an expatriate from a land whose foundation is expatriatism and whose heritage is the sons and daughters of expatriates and exslaves as a lonely and troubled intellectual he left his own testament of that heritageof africa of europe and americaa testament from him that had he never left we would not in the same way have had and he passed it on with a vision that was the first and perhaps the last of its kind we may see again from a black american writer in this generation wright it was a man t mes frc s seems important kpt rsk that this fact be re membered in the new times at the beginning of what already has been labeled as the new black renaissance when richard wright was born in mississippi most black americans lived in the southand not in the urban south at that as he grew up the great migration north was reaching its first peak but the southparticularly mississippiremained very much as it had been since the end of reconstruction the differ ence between slavery and voluntary servitude was minimal black people still had few rights which white men were bound to respect and the price of survival was bitter adjustment to this fact richard wright spent his childhood and early youth learning the rules of survival eventually he too joined the northward trek and his road led to chicago there in carl sandburgs city of the big shoulders the young mississippian found that the suburbs of his states mentality stretched the length and breadth of the land and that there was no physical journey he could make that would leave him beyond its limits he reached out to whatever refuge there was andfor a long and crucial timehe thought he found an escape in communism that in any case anchored him and freed the clamoring urge to art locked in his tortured psyche he wrote and the various literary organs of the left recognized his gifts and published his works then in when he was he published the novel native son which was to break many precedents for a book by a b ack writer and which made him famous for a while he lived the fe of literary lion in new york but as a literary lion of a certain hue and color made all the d fference after a second book the autobiographical black boy richard wright accepted an invitation from the government of france to come to paris and he went his household now included a wife who was jewish and white and a young daughter julia in france where he was lionized anew richard wright found a kind of freedom it was first of all physical but it also was spiritual and most important of all this freedom had a base which rested on a negatism which his own intelligence must have told him had to be resolved it never really was in any case the writers past had taught him lessons which applied no less to the world and he spoke to the world with several books black_power the color curtain which reflected his insight and his concern time passed another daughter rachel came and richard wright the expatriate hungered for a return to his roots it was this hunger which led him to try a little pathetic farming in the countryside beyond paris fame diminished american publishers grew less interested in his work sinister forces haunted him and finally his health and his marriage were threatened so notoriously s void of honesty is white society in this country that any writer made famous by it is an immediate suspect and if he is a negro writer double suspect black writers who are of extreme value to the black community for example cannot by definition be of much value to white society i am thinking of such writers as leroi tones and eldridge cleaver and conversely white writers of national popularity are the black communitys enemy one might say that a writer of richard wrights status is an exception but let me hasten to add that as a chronic black reader of literature i have felt in reading wrights books a strange uneasiness not about the subhuman puppets dangled before me but about the man controlling these puppetswho is really the booker t washington of american letters and is it not the messianic urge for another b t washington that haunts the white critic like irving howe who can so swiftly conclude that wright is ralph ellisons and james baldwins spirtual father because i had barely survived the dirt farms of north carolina myself i stayed away from wright as long as i could and even after i broke down and read native son and enjoyed it and was surprised even then i felt i was patronizing negro literature when i read baldwin ellison jones or cleaver however i read for mvseif i feel i understand something about myself as a black man and a wr ter i feel involved with these writers lives because they themselves are involved in explaining to themselves and to all who listen to their weird position in white america wright in contrast spent his life explaining someone else ie the bigger thomases to white people indeed bigger existed but not who were anxious to believe that wright himself it is not that the social reality portrayed by wright is false but that in so far as it represents wrights own life it is i do not wish to use the word lie so lets say simply that wright availed himself of a literary convention anyone wishing to view the distance between the benighted bigger thomas and the enlightened richard wright with more accurate measurement should compare for example wrights attitude towards white women in his fiction and his attitude towards them in his biography and his autobiographical works by insisting on the disparity between wrights life and the social reality he created i am not saying that wright was dishonest and that he betrayed however unwittingly the values of the black community rather to emphasize the extent to which literature is dependent for its impetus and impact on literary fashions and conventions one should avoid the implication of wrights social reality that south chicago was worse in the s than it is now wright wrote about chicago in the manner that he did because that was what white america was ready to accept in terms of literary fashion and social imagery or more accurately needed to accept white america branded wright the official negro protester the genuine article to reject him was to reject official genuine negro protest no matter what your own experience as a negro might have been in terms of popularity wright was the great american writer and in europe even more soand probably for the same reason that patch of blue was so popular in denmark i remember walking out of that movie in copenhagen trying to explain to sympathetic danish friends its not that simple i mean its more complex why i rejected the movies reality to reject wrights art is not to reject protest it is to reject negative protest to reject the white mans concept of protest which is that of a raging ferocious uncool demoralized black boy banging on the immaculate door of white society begging not so much for political justice as for his own identity and in the process consuming himself so that in the final analysis his destiny is at the mercy of the white man no to reject wright is not to reject protest it is to reject negative protest every black person who realizes how sick american white society is by the logic of this awareness makes a protest a positive protest this is a delicate point which the oversimplification of wrights social reality has obscured positive protest that creates as it eliminates it deals with the oppositions ugliness by concentrating on its own beauty leroi jones prose is positive protest because it is witty and beautiful to black people which means simply white people cannot understand it black children in the doorways of the ghetto doing the james brown or the uptight are positive protest directed against white people because white people cant dance negro digest is positive protest against the readers digest every ghettoi do not mean slumis positive protest against white insipid suburbs black people together involved with their lives carrying on with their black and bluesy culture is positive protest against the simpleness and the uninterestedness that haunt the abstracted lives of middleclass whites the argument that the value in richard wrights work lies in how well it describes the specific social climate that produced it is nothing more that a rationalization for the mans success and an erroneous one at that for it misses the point that it was wrights attitude towards the negro writer and negro literature that led him to believe there was a gold mine in explaining to white america the lives of black people it was his definition of negro writer that led him to select from his own vast and rich experiences those horrifying scraps from which emerged a dozen or so unbelievably dumb negroes just as the monster was created not by frankenstein but by mary shelley so wrights creation cannot be foisted off on society if we want to get to the key to wrights work we would do best by examining the theories of fiction wright accepted during his day a crucial question in wrights definition of the negro writer had to do with subjectmatter which stated simply that a negro writer was someone who wrote about negro life jesus this would make jessie hill ford nat hentoff robert penn warren and wiliam faulkner negro writers and as though this was not enough there was definite itemized catalog ie setpieces of what constituted negro lifethis of course was a much easier way out than saying negro life is anything that a negro does because this leaves a definition of negro too opened and baby white people werent having that just yet an intellectual life literary success marriage to a white woman for example did not constitute negro life at least not for the white reading public which explains why wright published not one scratch about this aspect of his life in order to see how black writing handles this compare for example the manner in which leroi jones handles these aspects of his life in plays dutchman and the slave wright believed as far too many people still do that there are certain categories which constitute black experience and others white experience that these white and black categories are and this is a shame ascribed with you when you are born and cannot be shaken by individual will for wright it was his damnation to be born black and his will to achieve whitenessie to pull himself up to the literary standards of white america the tenets of black writing today are the reverse of what wright believed for black writing a black writer is first of all black which means simply that he accepts the standards of black people over those of white america every negro baby in america is bom white born that is into a world of white values and if he is to survive that world he has to achieve blackness somewhere in the marrow of his youth must be that experience that awakening that rebirth jesus talked so much about which must carry him over to accept the reality of blackness this journey is ultimately an achievement of both grace and ones own will one must as ellison so strongly insists upon will to be a negro being a negro american involves a willed who wills to be a negro do affirmation of self against all outside pressures but the irving howe types freedom can be fought for but it cannot always be willed or asserted into existence wishes this werent so so then a black writer is not just some colored person trying to prove to white society that he is not a nigger orand that if he is white society is to blame no when we meet the black writer in the pages of his work we encounter someone who has achieved and willed an identity of blackness someone who has accepted negro life not as a burden as ellison puts it but as a discipline subjectmatter then is not part of the criteria in determining a black writer but quality of life will discipline and moral courage are a black writer can write about anything i mean this literally and what he has to say will still be said by a black man as leroi jones puts it if i say i am a black man all my writing is done by a black man whether i label each thing i write written by a black its still written by a black man so that if i point out a bird a black man has pointed out that bird and it is the weight of that experience in me and the way i get it from where it is to you that says whether or not i am a writer anger and beyond p the tragedy of richard wrights life is that he subscribed to a definition of the negro writer that was perniciously paradoxical on the one hand the role of the negro writer as wright saw it allowed him the potent power of the raging satirist while at the very same time rendered him in the last years of his life impotent and exiled it was near impossible for wright to change his ideas about the function of the writer because such ideas were as always intricately woven into the writers definition of his self to me wright as writer was less interesting than the enigma he personified ellison can say that he could so dissociate himself from the complexity of his background while trying so hard to improve the condition of black men everywhere that he could be so wonderful an example of human possibility but could not for ideological reasons depict a negro as intelligent as creative or as dedicated as himself anger and beyond p wrights idea of a negro writer was extremely middleclass which means that he believed that what white society thought to be negro reality was more important than what negroes knew to be their reality wright was exiled because his definition of negro life was too narrow too confining too puny and too dependent on white society wright was afraid to define negro life too broadly for fear it would cease to be negro a weird kind of insecurity ill it was wrights conception of what he thought his function as a negro writer should be that is primarily responsible for his style ie his attitude towards his reader and his characters the negro world that wright wrote about was so strange so far from the lives of his white audience that wright indulged too often in the explanatory the negro characters that he created are usually so subhuman so dumb that for the most part wright was forced to stand in the pages of his fiction as a kind of negro spokesman in order for a work of fiction to mean anything it must first of all involve the reader for a black reader it is difficult to become involvedi mean really involved with wrights characters because he is always there intruding with his commentary explaining as it were what to a black reader needs no apologetic explanation this explanatory mood of wrights resulted finally in a dull dessicated prosaic sentence structure that leaves nothing to the readers imagination it is not as some critics have stated that wright doesnt have a sense of humor in his fiction it is simply that his prose style strangles his humor which like most elements of black culture has nuances that are difficult to grasp with discursive prose it is only after we have laid the story aside for some time and have allowed our minds to rearrange the images the setting the tone of wrights stories only after that methodical and plodding rhythm of his prose has ceased to reverberate in our minds that we appreciate his humour one of the reasons incidentally that leroi jones is such a funny writer the alternative has to be one of the funniest stories ever written in america is that his style is essentially poetic and this is why too in tales he can convey so much of negro life poetry rather than prose seems to be the tool that is best for conveying the subtleties the nuances the complexity of negro culture wrights style is about as close to poetry as say booker t washingtons or richard nixons with the exception of two stories man of all work and man god aint like that both of which were written in dialogue which was wrights forte the book eight men is the dullest i have ever read everywhere the reader turns in the book there is the dumb subhuman animallike nigger and his eloquent interpreter who possessing some smattering of sociological theories usually has the responsibility of forging the animals actions into some acceptable universal or literary theme take for instance the first few lines of the very first story the man who was almost a man dave struck out across the fields looking homeward through paling light whuts the use talkin wid em niggers in the field anyhow his mother was putting supper on the table them niggers cant understan nothing one of these days he was going to get a gun and practice shooting then they couldnt talk to him as though he were a little boy p id wrights negroes never think although wright will tell you they do this is left up to wrightas ellison said wright could imagine bigger but bigger could not possibly imagine richard wright wright saw to that the third is by the narrator ie wright but it is and this is importantonly an interpretation of what presumably the character is thinking the fourth which is dave speaking again is fused with the narrators interpretation and finally the fifth sentence although written in the language of the narrator is the thoughts of the boyor is it the narrator putting words into the boys mouth the problem is this we believe we know something about the boys mind but we cant be sure for after all it was reported to us by the narrator we can never really know the boy the narrator stands between us such that at the end of the story our feeling towards the boy are ambivalent and anxious this anxiety builds up to disastrous proportions if in the course of the story the protagonist is the victim of violence because one is forced to feel great sympathy for someone one does not know and does not know why maybe this is why upon finishing each of these stories i felt a bit frustrated and unsatisfied the long short story the man who lived underground collected in eight men suffers greatly from wrights dumb negroeloquent spokesman device the story cites he adventures of a negro murderer fred who lives in a manhole making robinson crusoetvpe discoveries fred is quite childish and when he finds a stack of money unlike crusoe with his mature sense of what monev can do in english societv fred is only intrigued with the form and color of ptl he steals a typewriter and radio upon which he literally sperds hours tinkering like a yearold but it is not of a child wright wants us to think his s imagining fred as a subhuman as some human who has become less human because he has been shut out of whte society and this is what ic behind wrights statement about tred never in fredsl life had he used a typewriterl it was a oueer instrument of business somethin beyond the rim of his life italics addedas though usig a typewriter is going to add something to the quality of ones life fone is reminded of course of te demoralized bigger thomas who wants to do things to fly airolanes like white boys a cryin shame yet this subhuman who has no humanity to speak of or at least one is not convinced of it is transformed into an intellectual before the story endsbecause wright has to give the thing a universal theme he selects the theme of orestes and the furies fred then marches out of his manhole into the police station and confesses he is guilty the police try to convince him that they had already caught the murderer of the woman whom fred claims he killed the story ends when fred finally persuades two policemen to go down into the underground to witness what he had experienced so that at last he would be free of his burden when they are deep in the tunnel one of the police shoots him with the explanation youve got to shoot his kind theyd wreck things wright not only ended up with the universal theme but he even achieved a bit of tearjerker what black writing has come to realize is that meaning ie theme is always implied in the image one has only to paint the metaphor of blacknessthe whole community despite its pretense to the contrary knows that the meaning is and again the history of black people in this country is within itself a universal themethe most universal of themes what universal theme means that is in wright is to write so white people can understandie without really understanding in the few stories in which wright left off the dscursive prose and let his character do their own explaining he created masterpieces in lawd today for example the dialogue gets as close to poetry as wright ever got in this novel the dialogue is fascinating because it is used to provoke the atmosphere the mood of black people that the most skilled prose writer would have difficulty in capturing the last fourth of the book is the best piece of writing wright accomplished the proof of this being in the fact that one can return to it and reread it again and again the novel depicts one day in the life of a postal clerk and in order to give the events his inevitable commentary wright has that day happen on february abraham lincolns birthday throughout the novel there are brief reminders of the civil war reminders that are so planted in the novel as to remind the reader that these negroes although wrapped in their own black culture are not free yet if this novel in its celebration of negro life could shake itself free of wrights commentary device it would rival native son as being wrights most valuable book ill i have been talking about technique and style and how they were influenced by wrights definition of the negro writer let me now deal with the treatment of theme which in wrights work was as subject to being dictated by white society as well as style let us take for example the theme of the white woman and her relationship with the black man there is only one kind of interaction between these two and that is one of unadulterated violence inflicted by the black male who is imaged as an animal this relationship is as rigid and codified as any element of medieval sym bolism the idea that a white woman is only a human being and one to whom it is possible to feel something other than hate is an idea that wrights blacks are incapable of this despite the fact that wrights own experience taught him otherwise when max is questioning bigger thomas about his alleged rape and murder of the white girl mary dalton he suggests that bigger might have liked mary biggers reaction is depicted as that of an animals did you like her max asked like her biggers voice boomed so suddenly from his throat that max started bigger leaped to his feet his eyes widened and his hands lifted midway to face trembling italics added no no bigger max said p thus bigger the prototype nigger in his attitude towards the white woman is more of a creation of white society which is why white men like irving howe can so eagerly lay claim to him than he is of any black mans and so are those other black males in the pages of wrights fiction whose only response to white women is to chop off their heads concerning this baldwin has written in most of the novels by negroes until today there is a great space where sex ought to be and what usually fills this space is violence this violence as in so much of wrights work is gratuitoils and compulsive it is one of the severest criticisms that can be leveled against his work the violence is never examined i do not believe that wright did not examine that violence if it existed in his personal life what seems to be the case is that wright subscribed to a literary convention that had as much to do with life as say menthol cigarettes a convention responsible only to white society one could k for example at the treatment of the theme of the white woman in an autobiographical story called the man who went to chicago in which the hero is an intelligent young man whom we must recognize as none other than the author and his attitude towards white women is simply normal it is only when wright had to create fictional characters that he insisted on gratuitous violence iv native son bigger thomas like othello another victim of white society is dumb but whereas othellos error lies in othello in his perception biggers lies in bad style in richard wright biggers dumbness is only a thematic device wright is not so much interested in the character of bigger as he is in using whatever literary conventions to make an ideological point thus at the beginning of the novel it is convenient to have bigger extremely stupid for purposes of motivation and after the murder again it is convenient to give bigger some awareness of his crime thus adding to the significance of the crime as a theme so that on page bigger is so stupid that he doesnt know what a communist is when his friend helps him with a communist is a red he dumbly asks whats a red yet on page he is suddenly ruminating on world issues of late he had liked to hear tell of men who could rule others for in actions such as these he felt that here was an escape from his tight morass of fear and shame that sapped at the base of his life he liked to hear of how japan was conquering china of how hitler was running the jews to the ground of how mussolini was invading spain one ceases to believe in bigger as a character and there are moments when the reader grasps at biggers action and the ideas behind them with the same awe and lack of understanding that his own family did and this happens because one feels he does not know bigger which is because he doesnt exist as a human being a rebel without a brain biggers tragedy is a personal one and it exists in the fact that he simply refuses to cannot see wrights tragedy is that he fails to condemn this blindness though it may be that biggers demoralization is wrights ie wright as artist bigger for instance prides himself on the knowledge that no one would ever think that a black timid negro like himself was responsible or is this wright putting words in his mouth for he felt that they white people ruled him even when they were far away and not thinking of him ruled him by conditioning him in his relations to his own people p bigger is only embodying a fantasy white society created for him long ago and this is why he feels that the murder is an act of creation he talks about the murder bringing out the hidden meaning of his life this has to be taken ironically because what is really meant is that bigger a kind of racial correlative objective was created to serve white society biggei wanted to be white but he wasnt smart enough to see that what can be had in whiteness can most certainly be had in blackness why couldnt wright see this v criticsblack and white the distance between bigger thomas and richard wright even after the publication of black boy was so notoriously great that ellison in his famous essay richard wrights blues set out to explain it by discussing some of its cultural sources i hope to answer those critics who would make of the book a miracle and of its author a mystery one of those cultural sources ellison took to be the blues and so began his essay a much quoted paragraph on the function of the blues after this insightful opening ellison dwindles into some wellstated sociology about the southern rural family and has nothing else to say about the blues except in the last paragraph despite its title and general ini tent ellisons essay in retrospect sheds much doubt on whether wright ever really understood the blues in another essay a rejoinder published years later ellison disparages wrights knowledge of blues and says hemingway was more important to me than wright not because he was white or more accepted but because he appreciated the things of this earth which i love and which wright was too driven or deprived or inexperienced to know hemingways love for life ellison says in couiiterdistinction was very close to the feeling of the blues in terms of explaining wright i think ellison was much closer when he said recently that wright was as much a product of his reading as of his painful experiences and he made himself a writer by subjecting himself to the writers disciplineas he understood it this changing critical attitude of ellisons toward wright i cite as an example of how critical theory has changed in the last years it is interesting too that during the writing of his essay ellisons criticism was about as equally imbued with sociological theories as was wrights writing baldwins criticism of the protest novel everybodys protest novel in general and his essay alas poor richard in particular is very good critically on wright and precisely because baldwin stayed clear of theorieswell at least sociological ones irving howe is typical of the white critics who harbor a vested interest in richard wrights negroes in his now famous essay black boys and native sons howe claims his disagreement with ellison and baldwin has something to do with protest but howes real objection is that these writers unlike wright refuse to create demoralized unintelligible subhumans whose sole lifetime concern is consumed in hating the invincible force as howe lkes to imagine it of the white world rather these writers have given us humane courageous profound aware conscious heroes who are reallv more j concerned with themselves and their own realities than with those of white jewish intellectuals lke howe whom wright apparently was so respectful of howe accuses baldwin and ellison of not protesting but what he refuses to acknowledge is that baldwin and ellison for all their faults by virtue of their existence as excellent moral craftsmen are protesting their protest is positive protest because in addition to blasting the white world ie not letting white people get to them they erect black positive images richard wright begged baldwin ellison leroi jones eldridge cleaver are not begging and this upsets the howetypes because they need to hear the rasping rage of groveling demoralized bigger thomases at the door of white society in order to be assured themselves that white society still exists as the only possible alternative for the negro personality howe writes for example that in native son wright struggles to transcend violence that he did not fully succeed seems obvious one may doubt that any negro writer could now this cracker must be kidding because almost every black writer i know of has transcended violence at least that violence of biggers howe like wright believes that violence is the negro writers lot not to write about violence is to avoid writing about negro life this is why he finds giovannis room a flat failure because it abandons negro life entirely finally howe assigns wright as spiritual father to both ellison and baldwin ellison because he didnt come around to protest is suffering as a result but baldwin has come around baldwins most recent novel another country is a protest novel quite as much as native son no longer is baldwins prose so elegant or suave as it once was in this book it is harsh clumsy heavybreathng wth the pant of suppressed bitterness obviously this white man is speaking of negative protest demoralized protest and not the protest of james brown or leroi jones in other words positive protest that asserts its own beauty if you will its own elegance as it protests is not viable well howe and his buddies had better wake up or not wake up as they wish in that limited and almost barren field known as the negro novel arna bontemps black thunder fills a yawning gap and fills it competently covering all those skimpy reaches of negro letters i know this is the only novel dealing forthrightly with the historical and revolutionary traditions of the negro people black thunder is the true story of a slave insurrection that failed but in his telling of the story of that failure bontemps manages to reveal and dramatize through the character of his protagonist gabriel a quality of folk courage unparalleled in the proletarian literature of this country gabriel is a young slave who hearing of the struggles of the french proletariat and the exploits of louverture decides to avenge the murder of a fellowslave by leading the negroes of richmond virginia against the landowners on the night when the attack is to take place gabriels ragged slavehost armed with cutlasses pikes and a peck of bullets hides in the woods near richmond waiting for the call to advance and capture the arsenal at the crucal moment a terrific rainstorm sweeps down flooding the fields and bogging the roads this coupled with the treachery of two members of his band makes the uprising impossible gabriels army deserts him the next three weeks are times of wild terror for everywhere the white plantation owners are asking one another what negro can you point to and say definitely he is not involved from that juncture onward black thunder is mainly the story of gabriel who believes in the eventual triumph of his destiny in spite of all the forces which conspire against it he is convinced that god and the universe are on his side he believes he must and will lead the negro people to freedom he seems to have no personal fear and no personal courage he thinks dreams and feels wholly in terms of negro liberation his mind is a confused mixture of superstition naive cunning idealism and a high courage born partly of his deep ignorance and partly of an amazing ability to forget his personal safety he contemptuously refuses to run to the mountains to save himself and decides to stay near the scene of the insurrection to get in twothree mo good licks fo my time comes when considering gabriel solely as an isolated individual he seems sustained by an extremely foolish belief in himself but when one remembers his slave state when one realizes the extent to which he has made the wrongs of his people his wrongs and the degree in which he has submerged his hopes in their hopeswhen one remembers this he appears logically and gloriously invincible the plan for the uprising is so simple and daring that when it is disclosed and tracked to its source the fearridden whites can scarcely believe it but gabriel believes he believes even when he is caught even when the black cowl is capped about his head even when the ax swings he believes why for me the cardinal value of bontemps book besides the fact that it is a thumping story well told lies in the answer to that question perhaps i am straying further afield than the author did in search for an answer if i do it is because i believe we have in black thunder a revelation of the very origin and source of folk values in literature even though gabriels character is revealed in terms of personal action and dialogue i feel there is in him much more than mere personal dignity and personal courage there is in his attitude something which transcends the limits of immediate consciousness he is buoyed in his hope and courage by an optimism which takes no account of the appalling difficulties confronting him he hopes when there are no objective reasons or grounds for hope he fights when his fellowslaves scamper for their lives in doing so he takes his place in that gallery of fictitious characters who exist on the plane of the ridiculous and the sublime bontemps endows gabriel with a myth and deathless quality and it is in this sense i believe that black thunder sounds a new note in negro fiction thereby definitely extending the boundaries and ideology of the negro novel she stood with her black face some six inches from the moist windowpane and wondered when on earth would it ever stop raining it might keep up like this all week she thought she heard rain droning upon the roof and high up in the wet sky her eyes followed the silent rush of a bright shaft of yellow that swung from the airplane beacon in far off memphis momently she could see it cutting through the rainy dark it would hover a second like a gleaming sword above her head then vanish she sighed troubling johnnyboys been trampin in this slop all day wid no decent shoes on his feet through the window she could see the rich black earth sprawling outside in the night there was more rain than the clav could soak up pools stood everywhere she yawned and mumbled rains good n bad it kin make seeds bus up thu the groun er it kin bog things down lika watahsoaked coffin her hands were folded loosely over her stomach and the hot air of the kitchen traced a filmy veil of sweat on her forehead from the cook stove came the soft singing of burning wood and now and then a throaty bubble rose from a pot of simmering greens shucks johnnyboy coulda let somebody else do all tha runnin in the rain theres others bettah fixed fer it than he is but naw johnnyboy ain the one t trust nobody t do nothin hes gotta do it all hissef she glanced at a pile of damp clothes in a zinc tub waal ah bettah git t work she turned lifted a smoothing iron with a thick pad of cloth touched a spitwet finger to it with a quick jerking motion smiiiitz yeah its hot stooping she took a blue workshirt from the tub and shook it out with a deft twist of her shoulder she caught the iron in her right hand the fingers of her left hand took a piece of wax from a tin box and a frying sizzle came as she smeared the bottom she was thinking of nothing now her hands followed a lifelong ritual of toil spreading a sleeve she ran the hot iron to and fro until the wet cloth became stiff she was deep in the midst of her work when a song rose up out of the far off days of her childhood and broke through halfparted lips hes the lily of the valley the bright n mawnin star hes the fairest of ten thousan t mah soul a gust of wind dashed rain against the window johnnyboy oughta c mon home n eat his suppah aw lawd ltd be fine ef sug could eat wid us tonight ltd be like ol times mabbe aftah all it wont be long for he comes back tha lettah ah got from im las week said don give up hop yeah we gotta live in hope then both of her sons sug and johnnyboy would be back with her with an involuntary nervous gesture she stopped and stood still listening but the only sound was the lulling fall of rain shucks ain no usa me ackin this way she thought ever time they gits ready to hoi them meetings ah gits jumpity ah been a lil scared ever since sug went t jail she heard the clock ticking and looked johnnyboys a hour late he sho mus be havin a time doin all that trampin trampin thu the mud but her fear was a quiet one it was more like an intense brooding than a fear it was a sort of hugging of hated facts so closely that she could feel their grain like letting cold water run over her hand from a faucet on a winter morning she ironed again faster now as if she felt the more she engaged her body in work the less she would think but how could she forget johnnyboy out there on those wet fields rounding up white and black communists for a meeting tomorrow and that was just what sug had been doing when the sheriff had caught him beat him and tried to make him tell who and where his comrades were po sug they sho musta beat the boy somethin awful but thank gawd he didnt talk he ain no weaklin sug ain hes been lionhearted all his life long that had happened a year ago and now each time those meetings came around the old terror surged back while shoving the iron a cluster of toiling days returned days of washing and ironing to feed johnnyboy and sug so they could do party work days of carrying a hundred pounds of white folks clothes upon her head across fields sometimes wet and sometimes dry but in those days a hundred pounds was nothing to carry carefully balanced upon her head while stepping by instinct over the corn and cotton rows the only time it had seemed heavy was when she had heard of sugs arrest she had been coming home one morning with a bundle upon her head her hands swinging idly by her sides walking slowly with her eyes in front of her when bob johnnyboys pal had called from across the fields and had come and told her that the sheriff had got sug that morning the bundle had become heavier than she could ever remember and with each passing week now though she spoke of it to no one things were becoming heavier the tubs of water and the smoothing iron and the bundle of clothes were becoming harder to lift with her back aching so and her work was taking longer all because sug was gone and she didnt know just when johnnyboy would be taken too to ease the ache of anxiety that was swelling her heart she hummed then sang softly he walks wid me he talks wid me he tells me ahm his own guiltily she stopped and smiled looks like ah jus cant seem t fergit them ol songs no mattah how hard ah tries she had learned them when she was a little girl living and working on a farm every monday morning from the corn and cotton fields the slow strains had floated from her mothers lips lonely and haunting and later as the years had filled with gall she had learned their deep meaning long hours of scrubbing floors for a few cents a day had taught her who jesus was what a great boon it was to cling to him to be like him and suffer without a mumbling word she had poured the yearning of her life into the songs feeling buoyed with a faith beyond this world the figure of the man nailed in agony to the cross his burial in a cold grave his transfigured resurrection his being breath and clay god and manall had focused her feelings upon an imagery which had swept her life into a wondrous vision but as she had grown older a cold white mountain the white folks and their laws had swum into her vision and shattered her songs and their spell of peace to her that white mountain was temptation something to lure her from her lord a part of the world god had made in order that she might endure it and come through all the stronger just as christ had risen with greater glory from the tomb the days crowded with trouble had enhanced her faith and she had grown to love hardship with a bitter pride she had obeyed the laws of the white folks with a soft smile of secret knowing after her mother had been snatched up to heaven in a chariot of fire the years had brought her a rough working man and two black babies sug and johnnyboy all three of whom she had wrapped in the charm and magic of her vision then she was tested by no less than god her man died a trial which she bore with the strength shed by the grace of her vision finally even the memory of her man faded into the vision itself leaving her with two black boys growing tall slowly into manhood then one day grief had come to her heart when johnnyboy and sug had walked forth demanding their lives she had sought to fill their eyes with her vision but they would have none of it and she had wept when they began to boast of the strength shed by a new and terrible vision but she had loved them even as she loved them now bleeding her heart had followed them she could have done no less being an old woman in a strange world and day by day her sons had ripped from her startled eyes her old vision and image by image had given her a new one different but great and strong enough to fling her into the light of another grace the wrongs and sufferings of black men had taken the place of him nailed to the cross the meager beginnings of the party had become another resurrection and the hate of those who would destroy her new faith had quickened in her a hunger to feel how deeply her new strength went lawd johnnyboy she would sometimes say ah jus wan them white folks t try t make me tell who is in the party n who ainl ah jus wan em t try n ahll show em somethin they never thought a black woman could have but sometimes like tonight while lost in the forgetfulness of work the past and the present would become mixed in her while toiling under a strange star for a new freedom the old songs would slip from her lips with their beguiling sweetnessthe iron was getting cold she put more wood into the fire stood again at the window and watched the yellow blade of light cut through the wet darkness johnnyboy ain here yit then before she was aware of it she was still listening for sounds under the drone of rain she heard the slosh of feet in mud tha ain johnnyboy she knew his long heavy footsteps in a million she heard feet come on the porch some woman she heard bare knuckles knock three times then once thas some of them comrades she unbarred the door cracked it a few inches and flinched from the cold rush of damp wind whos tha its me who me reva she flung the door open lawd chile c mon in she stepped to one side and a thin blondhaired white girl ran through the door as she slid the bolt she heard the girl gasping and shaking her wet clothes somethings wrong reva wouldna walked a mile t mah house in all this slop fer nothin tha gals stuck onto johnnyboy ah wondah ef anythin happened t im git on inter the kitchen reva where its

johnnyboy was already lost to her she was feeling the pain that would come when she knew it for certain and she was feeling that she would have to be brave and bear it she was like a person caught in a swift current of water and knew where the water was sweeping her and did not want to go on but had to go on to the end it ain nothin bout johnnyboy an sue said reva but we gotta do somethin er well

done being a woman reva was not suspect she would have to go it wis just as natural for reva to go back through the cold rain as it was for her to iron night and day or for sug to be in jail right now johnnyboy was out there on those dark fields trying to get home lawd don let em git im tonight in spite of herself her feelings became torn she loved her son and loving him she loved what he was trying to do johnnyboy was happiest when he was working for the party and her love for him was for his happiness she frowned trying hard to fit something together in her feelings for her to try to stop johnnyboy was to admit that all the toil of years meant nothing and to let him go meant that sometime or other he would be caught like sug in facing it this way she felt a little stunned as though she had come suddenly upon a blank wall in the dark but outside in the rain were people white and black whom she had known all her life those people depended upon johnnyboy loved him and looked to him as a man and leader yeah hes gotta keep on he cant stop now she looked at reva she was crying and pulling her shoes back on with reluctant fingers whut you carryin on tha way fer chile yuh done los sug now yuh sending johnnyboy a got t honey she was glad she could say that reva believed in black folks and not for anything in the world would she falter before her in revas trust and acceptance of her she had found her first feelings of humanity revas love was her refuge from shame and degradation if in early days of her life the white mountain had driven her back from the earth then in her last days revas love was drawing her toward it like the beacon that swung through the night outside she heard reva sobbing hush honey mah brothers in jail too ma cries ever day ah know honey she helped reva with her coat her fingers felt the scant flesh of the girls shoulders she don git ernuff t eat she thought she slipped her arms around revas waist and held her close for a moment now yuh stop that cryin aaah cccant hep it everythingll be awright johnnyboyll be back yuh think so sho chile cos he will neither of them spoke again until they stood in the doorway outside they could hear water washing through the ruts of the street be sho n send johnnyboy t tell the folks t stay erway from pas house said reva ahll tell im don yuh worry goodbye goodbye leaning against the door jamb she shook her head slowly and watched reva vanish through the falling rain ii she was back at her board ironing when she heard feet sucking in the mud of the back yard feet she knew from long years of listening were johnnyboys but tonight with all the rain and fear his coming was like a leaving was almost more than she could bear tears welled to her eyes and she blinked them away she felt that he was coming so that she could give him up to see him now was to say goodbye but it was a goodbye she knew she could never say they were not that way toward each other all day long they could sit in the same room and not speak she was his mother and he was her son most of the time a nod or a grunt would carry all the meaning that she wanted to convey to him or he to her she did not even turn her head when she heard him come stomping into the kitchen she heard him pull up a chair sit sigh and draw off his muddy shoes they fell to the floor with heavy thuds soon the kitchen was full of the scent of his drying socks and his burning pipe tha boys hongry she paused and looked at him over her shoulder he was puffing at his pipe with his head tilted back and his feet propped up on the edge of the stove his eyelids drooped and his wet clothes steamed from the heat of the fire lawd tha boy gits mo like his pa ever day he lives she mused her lips breaking in a slow faint smile hols tha pipe in his mouth just like his pa usta hoi his wondah how they woulda got erlong ef his pa had lived they oughta liked each other they so mucha like she wished there could have been other children besides sug so johnnyboy would not have to be so much alone a man needs a woman by his side she thought of reva she liked reva the brightest glow her heart had ever known was when she had learned that reva loved johnnyboy but beyond reva were cold white faces ef theys caught it means death she jerked around when she heard johnnyboys pipe clatter to the floor she saw him pick it up smile sheepishly at her and wag his head gawd ahm sleepy he mumbled she got a pillow from her room and gave it to him here she said hunh he said putting the pillow between his head and the back of the chair they were silent again yes she would have to tell him to go back out into the cold rain and slop maybe to get caught maybe for the last time she didnt know but she would let him eat and get dry before telling him that the sheriff knew of the meeting to be held at lems tomorrow and she would make him take a big dose of soda before he went out soda always helped to stave off a cold she looked at the clock it was eleven theres time yit spreading a newspaper on the apron of the stove she placed a heaping plate of greens upon it a knife a fork a cup of coffee a slab of cornbread and a dash of peach cobbler yo suppahs ready she said yeah he said he did not move she ironed again presently she heard him eating when she could no longer hear his knife tinkling against the edge of the plate she knew he was

clothes in her dresser drawer she poured herself a cup of black coffee drew up a chair sat down and drank yuh almos dry she said not looking around yeah he said turning sharply to her the tone of

visit from the sheriff today bout the meetin yeah she saw him stare at the coals glowing red through the crevices of the stove and run his fingers nervously through his hair she knew he was wondering

window she looked at his back in a long silence she knew his faith it was deep he had always said that black men could not fight the rich bosses alone a man could not fight with every hand against him but he believes so hard hes blind she thought at odd times they had had these arguments before always she would be pitting her feelings against the hard necessity of his thinking and always she would lose she shook her head po johnnyboy he don know but ain nona our folks tol johnnyboy she said how yuh know he asked his voice came low and with a tinge of anger he still faced the window and now and then the yellow blade of light flicked across the sharp outline of his black face cause ah know em she said anybody mighta tol he said it wuznt nona our folks she said again she saw his hand sweep in

even keep yo coat buttoned her nimble fingers fastened his collar high around his throat there he pulled the brim of his hat low over his eyes she opened the door and with the suddenness of the cold gust of wind that struck her face he was gone she watched the black fields and the rain take him her eyes burning when the last faint footstep could no longer be heard she closed the door went to her bed lay down and pulled the cover over her while fully dressed her feelings coursed with the rhythm of the rain hes gone lawd ah know hes gone her blood felt cold she was floating in a grey void somewhere between sleeping and dreaming and then suddenly she was wide awake hearing and feeling in the same instant the thunder of the door crashing in and a cold wind filling the room it was pitch black and she stared resting on her elbows her mouth open not breathing her ears full of the sound of tramping feet and booming voices she knew at once they lookin fer im then filled with her will she was on her feet rigid waiting listening the lamps burnin yuh see her naw look in the kitchen gee this place smells like niggers say somebodys here er been here yeah theres fire in the stove mabbe hes

gnarled black hands as always folded over her stomach but tight now so tightly the veins bulged the kitchen was crowded with white men in glistening raincoats though the lamp burned their flashlights still glowed in red fists across her floor she saw the muddy tracks of their boots yuh white folks git outta mah house there was quick silence every face turned toward her she saw a sudden movement but did not know what it meant until something hot and wet slammed her squarely in the face she gasped but did not move calmly she wiped the warm greasy liquor of greens from her eyes with her left hand one of the white men had thrown a handful of greens out of the pot at her how they taste ol bitch ah ast yuh t git outta mah house she saw the sheriff detach himself from the crowd and walk toward her now anty white man don yuh anty me yuh ain got the right sperit sperit hell yuh git these men outta mah house yuh ack like yuh don like it naw ah don like it n yuh knows dam waal ah don

one wheres that nigger son of yos the sheriff asked find im she said by gawd ef we hafta find im well kill im he wont be the only nigger yuh ever killed she said she was consumed with a bitter pride there was nothing on this earth she felt then that they could not do to her but that she could take she stood on a narrow plot of ground from which she would die before she was pushed and then it was while standing there feeling warm blood seeping down her throat that she gave up johnnyboy gave him up to the white folks she gave him up because they had come tramping into her heart demanding him thinking they could get him by beating her thinking they could scare her into making her tell where he was she gave him up because she wanted them to know that they could not get what they wanted by bluffing and killing wheres this meetin gonna be the sheriff asked don yuh wish yuh knowed ain there gonna be a meetin how come yuh astin me there is gonna be a meetin said the sheriff is it ah gotta

wont be the only nigger yuh ever killed she said again the sheriff walked past her the others followed yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted she thought exultingly n yuh ain gonna never git it hotly something ached in her to make them feel the intensity of her pride and freedom her heart groped to turn the bitter hours of her life into words of a kind that would make them feel that she had taken all they had done to her in her stride and could still take more her faith surged so strongly in her she was all but blinded she walked behind them to the door knotting and twisting her fingers she saw them step to the muddy ground each whirl of the yellow beacon revealed glimpses of slanting rain her lips moved then she shouted yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted n yuh ain gonna nevah git it the sheriff stopped and turned his voice came low and hard now by gawd thas ernuff outta yuh ah know when ah done said ernuff aw naw yuh don he said yuh don know when yuh done said ernuff but ahma teach yuh ternight he was up the steps and across the porch with one bound she backed into the hall her eyes full on his face tell me when yuh gonna stop talkin he said swinging his fist the blow caught her high on the cheek her eyes went blank she fell flat on her face she felt the hard heel of his wet shoes coming into her temple and stomach lemme hear yuh talk some mo she wanted to but could not pain numbed and choked her she lay still and somewhere out of the grey void of unconsciousness she heard someone say aw fer chrissakes leave her erlone its the nigger we wan she never knew how long she had lain huddled in the dark hallway her first returning feeling was of a nameless fear crowding the inside of her then a deep pain spreading from her temple downward over her body her ears were filled with the drone of rain and she shuddered from the cold wind blowing through the door she opened her eyes and at first saw nothing as if she were imagining it she knew she was halflying and halfsitting in a corner against a wall with difficulty she twisted her neck and what she saw made her hold her breatha vast white blur was suspended directly above her for a moment she could not tell if her fear was from the blur or if the blur was from her fear gradually the blur resolved itself into a huge white face that slowly filled her vision she was stone still conscious really of the effort to breathe feeling somehow that she existed only by the mercy of that white face she had seen it before its fear had gripped her many times it had for her the fear of all the white faces she had ever seen in her life sue as from a great distance she heard her name being called she was regaining consciousness now but the fear was coming with her she looked into the face of a white man wanting to scream out for him to go yet accepting his presence because she felt she had to though some remote part of her mind was active her limbs were powerless it was as if an invisible knife had split her in two leaving one half of her lying there helpless while the other half shrank in dread from a forgotten but familiar enemy sue its me sue its me then all at once the voice came clearly sue its me its booker and she heard an answering voice speaking inside of her yeah its booker the one wuht jus joined she roused herself struggling for full consciousness and as she did so she transferred to the person of booker the nameless fear she felt it seemed that booker towered above her as a challenge to her right to exist upon the earth yuh awright she did not answer she started violently to her feet and fell sue yuh hurt yeah she breathed where they hit yuh its mah head she whispered she was speaking even though she did not want to the fear that had hold of her compelled her they beat yuh yeah them bastards them gawddam bastards she heard him saying it over and over then she felt herself being lifted naw she gasped ahma take yuh t the kitchen put me down but yuh cant stay here like this she shrank in his arms and pushed her hands against his body when she was in the kitchen she freed herself sank into a chair and held tightly to its back she looked wonderingly at booker there was nothing about him that should frighten her so but even that did not ease her tension she saw him go to the water bucket wet his handkerchief wring it and offer it to her distrustfully she stared at the damp cloth here put this on yo fohead naw cmon itll make yuh feel bettah she hesitated in confusion what right had she to be afraid when someone was acting as kindly as this toward her reluctantly she leaned forward and pressed the damp cloth to her head it helped with each passing minute she was catching hold of herself yet wondering why she felt as she did whut happened ah don now yuh feel bettah yeah who all wuz here ah don know she said again yo head still hurt yeah gee ahm sorry ahm awright she sighed and buried her face in her hands she felt him touch her shoulder sue ah got some bad news fer yuh she knew she stiffened and grew cold it had happened she stared dryeyed with compressed lips its mah johnnyboy she said yeah ahm awful sorry t hafta tell yuh this way but ah thought yuh oughta know her tension eased and a vacant place opened up inside of her a voice whispered jesus help me wwwhere is he they got im out t foleys woods trying t make im tell who the others is he ain gonna tell she said they just as waal kill im cause he ain gonna tell ah hope he don said booker but he didnt hava chance t tell the others they grabbed im just as he got t the woods then all the horror of it flashed upon her she saw flung out over the rainy countryside an array of shacks where white and black comrades were sleeping in the morning they would be rising and going to lems then they would be caught and that meant terror prison and death the comrades would have to be told she would have to tell them she could not entrust johhnyboys work to another and especially not to booker as long as she felt toward him as she did gripping the bottom of the chair with both hands she tried to rise the room blurred and she swayed she found herself resting in bookers arms lemme go sue yuh too weak t walk ah gotta tell em she said set down sue yuh hurt yuh sick when seated she looked at him helplessly sue listen johnnyboys caught ahm here yuh tell me who they is n ahll tell em she stared at the floor and did not answer yes she was too weak to go there was no way for her to tramp all those miles through the rain tonight but should she tell booker if only she had somebody like reva to talk to she did not want to decide alone she must make no mistake about this she felt bookers fingers pressing on her arm and it was as though the white mountain was pushing her to the edge of a sheer height she again exclaimed inwardly jesus hep me bookers white face was at her side waiting would she be doing right to tell him suppose she did not tell and then the comrades were caught she could not ever forgive herself for doing a thing like that but maybe she was wrong maybe her fear was what johnnyboy had always called jus foolishness she remembered his saying ma we cant make the party grow ef we start doubtin everbody tell me who they is sue n ahll tell em ah jus joined n ah don know who they is ah don know who they is she said yuh gotta tell me who they is sue ah tol yuh ah don know yuh do

cause ahm white johnnyboy ain like tha don let all the work we done go fer nothin she gave up and bowed her head in her hands is it johnson tell me sue yeah she whispered in horror a mounting horror of feeling herself being undone is it green yeah murphy lawd ah don know yuh gotta tell me sue mistah booker please leave me erlone is it murphy she answered yes to the names of johnnyboys comrades she answered until he asked her no more then she thought how he know the sheriffs men is watchin lems house she stood up and held onto her chair feeling something sure and firm within her how yuh know bout lem why how ah know whut yuh doin here this tima night how yuh know the sheriff got johnnyboy sue don yuh believe in me she did not but she could not answer she stared at him until her lips hung open she was searching deep within herself for certainty you meet reva she asked reva yeah lems gal oh yeah sho ah met reva she tell yuh she asked the question more of herself than of him she longed to believe yeah he said softly ah reckon ah oughta be going t tell em now who she asked tell whot the muscles of her body were stiff as she waited for his answer she felt as though life depended upon it the comrades he said yeah she sighed she did not know when he left she was not looking or listening she just suddenly saw the room empty and from her the thing that had made her fearful was gone v for a space of time that seemed to her as long as she had been upon the earth she sat huddled over the cold stove one minute she would say to herself they both gone now johnnyboy n sug maybe ahll never see em ergin then a surge of guilt would blot out her longing lawd ah shouldna tol she mumbled but no man kin be so lowdown as t do a think like tha several times she had an impulse to try to tell the comrades herself she was feeling a little better now but what good would that do she had told booker the names he jus couldnt be a judas t po folks like us he couldnt an sue thas reva her heart leaped with an anxious gladness she rose without answering and limped down the dark hallway through the open door against the background of rain she saw revas face lit now and then to whiteness by the whirling beams of the beacon she was about to call but a thought checked her jesus hep me ah gotta tell her bout johnnyboy lawd ah cant an sue yuh there c mon in chile she caught reva and held her close for a moment without speaking lawd ahm sho glad yuh here she said at last ah thought somethin had happened t yuh said reva pulling away ah saw the do open pa tol me to come back n stay wid

about johnnyboy and booker ahll wait a lil while longer she thought now that reva was here her fear did not seem as awful as before c mon lemme fix yo head an sue yuh hurt they went to the kitchen she sat silent while reva dressed her scalp she was feeling better now in just a little while she would tell reva she felt the girls finger pressing gently upon her head tha hurt a chile yuh po thing it

ah cant carry on way in fronta reva right now she had a deep need for reva to believe in her she watched the girl get pineknots from behind the stove rekindle the fire and put on the coffee pot yuh wan some cawffee reva asked naw honey aw c mon an sue jusa lil honey thas the way to be oh say ah fergot said reva measuring out spoonsful of coffee pa tol me t tell yuh t watch out fer that booker man hes a stool she showed not one sign of outward movement or expression but as the words fell from revas lips she went limp inside pa tol me soon as ah got back home he got word from town she stopped listening she felt as though she had been slapped to the extreme outer edge of life into a cold darkness she knew now what she had felt when she had looked up out of her fog of pain and had seen booker it was the image of all the white folks and the fear that went with them that she had seen and felt during her lifetime and again for the second time that night something she had felt had come true all she could say to herself was ah didnt like im gawd knows ah didnt ah tol johnnyboy it wuz some of them white folks here drink yo cawffee she took the cup her fingers trembled and the steaming liquid spilt onto her dress and leg ahm sorry an sue her leg was scalded but the pain did not bother her its awright she said wait lemme put some lard on tha bum it don hurt yuh worried bout somethin naw honey lemme fix yuh so mo cawffee ah don wan nothin now reva waal buck up don be tha way they were silent she heard reva drinking no she would not tell reva reva was all she had left but she had to do something some way somehow she was undone too much as it was and to tell reva about booker or johnnyboy was more than she was equal to it would be too coldly shameful she wanted to be alone and fight this thing out with herself go t bed honey yuh tired naw ahm awright an sue she heard the bottom of revas empty cup clank against the top of the stove ah got t make her go t bed yes booker would tell the names of the comrades to the sheriff if she could only stop him some way that was the answer the point the star that grew bright in the morning of new hope soon maybe half an hour from now booker would reach foleys woods hes boun t go the long way cause he don know no short cut she thought ah could wade the creek n beat im there but what would she do after that reva honey go t bed ahm awright yuh need res ah ain sleepy an sue ah knows whuts bes fer yuh chile yuh tired n wet ah wanna stay up wid yuh she forced a smile and said ah don think they gonna hurt johnnyboy ah ain sleepy an sue sho honey but ah wanna wait up wid yuh thas mah job honey thas whut a mas fer t wait up fer her chullun good night an sue she watched reva pull up and leave the kitchen presently she heard the shucks in the mattress whispering and she knew that reva had gone to bed she was alone through the cracks of the stove she saw the fire dying to grey ashes the room was growing cold again the yellow beacon continued to flit past the window and the rain still drummed yes she was alone she had done this awful thing alone she must find some way out alone like touching a festering sore she put her fingers upon that moment when she had shouted her defiance to the sheriff when she had shouted to feel her strength she had lost sug to save others she had let johnnyboy go to save others and then in a moment of weakness that came from too much strength she had lost all if she had not shouted to the sheriff she would have been strong enough to have resisted booker she would have been able to tell the comrades herself something tightened in her as she remembered and understood the fit of fear she had felt on coming to herself in the dark hallway a part of her life she thought she had done away with forever had had hold of her then she had thought the soft warm past was over she had thought that it did not mean much when now she sang hes the lily of the valley the bright n mawnin star the days when she had sung that song were the days when she had not hoped for anything on this earth the days when the cold mountain had driven her into the arms of jesus she had thought that sug and johnnyboy had taught her to forget him to fix her hope upon the fight of black men for freedom through the gradual years she had believed and worked with them had felt strength shed from the grace of their terrible vision that grace had been upon her when she had let the sheriff slap her down it had been upon her when she had risen time and again from the floor and faced him but she had trapped herself with her own hunger to water the long dry thirst of her faith her pride had made a bargain which her flesh could not keep her having told the names of johnnyboys comrades was but an incident in a deeper horror she stood up and looked at the floor while call and countercall loyalty and counterloyalty struggled in her soul mired she was between two abandoned worlds living but dying without the strength of the grace that either gave the clearer she felt it the fuller did something well up from the depths of her for release the more urgent did she feel the need to fling into her black sky another star another hope one more terrible vision to give her strength to live and act softly and restlessly she walked about the kitchen feeling herself naked against the night the rain the world and shamed whenever the thought of revas love crossed her mind she lifted her empty hands and looked at her writhing fingers lawd whut kin ah do now she could still wade the creek and get to foleys woods before booker and then what how could she manage to see johnnyboy or booker again she heard the sheriffs threatening voice git yuh a sheet cause hes gonna be dead the sheet thas it the sheet her whole being leaped with will the long years of her life bent toward a moment of focus a point ah kin go wid mah sheet ahll be doin whut he said lawd gawd in heaven ahma go lika nigger woman wid mah windin sheet t git mah dead son but then what she stood straight and smiled grimly she had in her heart the whole meaning of her life her entire personality was poised on the brink of a total act ah know ah know she thought of johnny boys gun in the dresser drawer ahll hide the gun in the sheet n go aftah johnnyboys body she tiptoed to her room eased out the dresser drawer and got a sheet reva was sleeping the darkness was filled with her quiet breathing she groped in the drawer and found the gun she wound the gun in the sheet and held them both under her apron then she stole to the bedside and watched reva lawd hep her but mabbe shes bettah off this had t happen sometimes she n johnnyboy couldna been together in this here south n ah couldnt tell her bout booker itll come out awright n she wont evah know revas trust would never be shaken she caught her breath as the shucks in the mattress rustled dryly then all was quiet and she breathed easily again she tiptoed to the door down the hall and stood on the porch above her the yellow beacon whirled through the rain she went over muddy ground mounted a slope stopped and looked back at her house the lamp glowed in her window and the yellow beacon that swung every few seconds seemed to feed it with light she turned and started across the fields holding the gun and sheet tightly thinking po reva po critter shes fas ersleep vi for the most part she walked with her eyes half shut her lips tightly compressed leaning her body against the wind and the driving rain feeling the pistol in the sheet sagging cold and heavy in her fingers already she was getting wet it seemed that her feet found every puddle of water that stood between the corn rows she came to the edge of the creek and paused wondering at what point was it low taking the sheet from under her apron she wrapped the gun in it so that her fingers could be upon the trigger ahll cross here she thought at first she did not feel the water her feet were already wet but the water grew cold as it came up to her knees she gasped when it reached her waist lawd this creeks high when she had passed the middle she knew that she was out of danger she came out of the water climbed a grassy hill walked on turned a bend and saw the lights of autos gleaming ahead yeah theys still there she hurried with her head down wondah did ah beat im here lawd ah hope so a vivid image of bookers white face hovered a moment before her eyes and a surging will rose up in her so hard and strong that it vanished she was among the autos now from nearby came the hoarse voices of the men hey yuh she stopped nervously clutching the sheet two white men with shotguns came toward her whut in hell yuh doin out here she did not answer didnt yuh hear somebody speak t yuh ahm comin aftah

grabbed her arms and she clutched hard at the sheet and gun they led her toward the crowd in the woods her feelings were simple booker would not tell she was there with the gun to see to that the louder became the voices of the men the deeper became her feeling of wanting to right the mistake she had made of wanting to fight her way back to solid ground she would stall for time until booker showed up oh ef theyll only lemme git close t johnnyboy as they led her near the crowd she saw white faces turning and looking at her and hear a rising clamor of voices whos tha a nigger woman whut

sprawled in the mud on his face his hands stretched out before him then a cluster of yelling men blotted him out she lay without struggling looking upward through the rain at the white faces above her

voices her lips moved soundlessly yuh didnt git yuh didnt yuh didnt focused and pointed she was buried in the depths of her star swallowed in its peace and strength and not feeling her flesh growing cold cold as the rain that fell from the invisible sky upon the doomed living and the dead that never dies i am still inclined to see richard wright through the haze of popularfront nostalgia which i attach to many of the public phenomena of my nineteenthirties childhood i was only seven years old when native son was published in but it seems to me i can recall the warm reassurance with which it was received then by the middleclass jewish circles in brooklyn amidst which i was growing up i responded to the book in the same way when i finally read it in during the height of the civilrights eraanother kind of popularfront somewhat surprised to discover that its hero was a murderer i nevertheless felt that by the books end wright had more or less come back to making his peace with the family feeling against which bigger thomas had been defined that he was returning home to the liberalradical brotherhood of white and black after his fling at delinquency even while continuing to mutter sullen protests under his breath for this home was the one place i had assumed on the basis of wrights essay in the god that failed the only other work of his id read at the time that provided the atmosphere of human solidarity which enabled him to create and i supposed that it was nothing but the steadily growing corruption and relentless absolutism of the household that could have caused him to leave it as he eventually did my view was founded of course in a family pride that was extreme even though i myself had never been anything more radical than some kind of social democrat i think that if one goes deep enough one can find in the heart of every european marxist who was born a jew the notion that his jewishness somehow provides a paradigm for the condition of the proletariat so also is a similar conception of the lot of the negro probably to be found in the hearts of most american jewish intellectuals this is simply a revolutionaryage variant of the jews traditional presumption about himself being the elder brother to all men in suffering and in perceiving glimmers of the apocalypse at the brooklyn high school i attended in the late nineteenforties for example where the vast majority of the students were jewish and liberal there was a negro in the class ahead of me there were perhaps three or four negro students in the whole school who brilliant student that he was was lionized to such a degree that he almost became a public property we perceived him as if we were looking at ourselves in a dark mirror and he responded with a lifestyle that seemed to be an enhanced version of any of our own richard wright must have experienced something like this befriended surrounded advised and admonished by warmly admiring jewish artists and intellectuals from the moment he joined the communist party in to the t me he left it in bringing away with him the jewish wife he had found in its midst his life could easily have been viewed in the dark mirror by those jewish radicals who wished to do so born in the shtetl natchez mississippi in he emigrated to the american urban ghetto chicagos south c side in his voung manhood began his selfeducation as a writer and intellectual by reading such authors as h l mencken and received his higher education in the john reed club and the communist party it was according to wrights account in the god that failed a jewish writer named sol who first steered him to the chicago john reed club where he was introduced to a jewish boy who was to become one of the nations leading painters ben shahn according to wrights biographer constance webb to a chao who was to become one of the eminent composers of his day to a writer who was to create some of the best novels of his generation nelson algren again according to constance webb to a young jewish boy who was destined to film the nazi occupation of czechoslovakia the euphoria of fimes suc h as these could not have been easily forgotten and even in native son when wright is struggling to throw off the mantle of the communist brotherhood bigger thomas significantly achieves the only genuinely human relationshios with whites he has ever known through the friendship of two jewish communists the old lawyer max who tries to defend him against the death sentence and jan ehone modeled as constance webb tells us after a canadian jew named jan wittenber of whom wright had said that he alone erlone in the dialect of the southern negroes of wrights stories among the chicago comrades had shown a depth and richness of human understanding toward him that went beyond mere ideology wright responded loyally at first to the requirements of the brotherhood that had taken him in and given him his start as a writer and intellectual starting out as a poet he contributed to party journals such orthodox statements as this one published in the new masses in i am black and i have seen black hands raised in fists of revolt side by side with the white fists of white workers and some dayand it is only this which sustains me some day there shall be millions and millions of them on some red day in a burst of fists on a new horizon the image of the negro contained in this leftwhitmanesque vision is ultimately that of the supreme negro ideal of the epoch paul robeson singing the ballad for americans sleeves rolled up the black worker standing alongside the white worker fists clenched in anger at a common injustice as with many elements of the communist orthodoxy there was a thin and tortuous line that had to be walked in order to keep the purity of this vision intact the party strove to make the negro cause its ownultimately this was a european mythology trying to impose itself upon an american conditionand wright by the designated chief negro spokesman for the movements literary wing was assigned the delicate task of finding a black literary credo that would provide a more authentic voice for the negro masses than either the essentially bourgeoisassimilationist writings of the talented tenth had done prior to the first world war or the cutely folkloric works of the harlem school had achieved in the twenties but that would not veer over on the other hand into the excesses of negro nationalism such a credo was formulated in his essay blueprint for negro writing published in the fall issue of the partys shortlived negro literary journal new challenge which wright edited but it was one thing to theorize about such a negro literature and another thing entirely to practice it i have seen black hands may have satisfied the party hierarchy as an example of what to do but it could hardly suffice for a serious writer where was wright to find his own literary identity he evidently had his first intimation of an answer to this question in the fall of when he published an article in the new masses on joe louis knockout victory over max baer a jew incidentally for the world heavyweight championship in it the author of i have seen black hands commits the heresy of seeing for a moment the black fists alone entitled joe louis uncovers dynamite the article is entirely a description of the brief but violent outburst of rioting that took place in chicagos south side ghetto in the wake of louis victory for a fleeting instant it was black against white a confrontation founded in hostilities far deeper than those superficially contained in the question hurled at white passersby who yuh fer baer or louis a taxicab driver had his cab wrecked when he tried to put up a show of bravado in the face of this question storekeepers wright says gazed out their windows at the demonstrators in fear and with blanched faces inspired by louis example the rioters seemed to be saying we aint scared either well fight too when the time comes well win too wright does not hesitate to append his own enthusiasm to his description of the scene really he writes there was a religious feeling in the air well it wasnt exactly a religious feeling but it was something and you could feel it it was a feeling of unity of oneness and then later something had popped loose all right and it had come from deep down out of the darkness it had leaped from its coil and nobody could have said just what it was and nobody wanted to say blacks and whites were afraid but it was a sweet fear at least for the blacks it was a mingling of fear and fulfillment four centuries of oppression were rising to the surface the separatist implications of these remarks could not have struck communist sensibilities lightly and it is significant that the editors of the new masses saw fit to place at the head of the article a brief preface that sought to smooth over some of its ideological rough spots something of the same emotional release the editors granted occurs whenever a negro triumphs in competition with a white person but from this they moved on quickly to a reassertion of the orthodox view of the negros role in the revolution the communist party consisting of negroes as well as whites has made valiant beginningsthe scottsboro defense the demonstrations against italian fascism and in scores of other instances it was perhaps as a concession to this view that wright concluded his article by saying say comrade heres a wild river thats got to be harnessed and directed but the river released by this episode in wrights own spirit was not to be so easily harnessed his first major short story big boy leaves home published a few months after this article is a further inquiry into the nature of that dynamite uncovered by joe louis knockout blow it anticipates native son not only in the similarity of its protagonists name to that of bigger thomas but in the central act of the story big boys murder of a white man this act is committed in selfdefense just as biggers killing of the white girl is an accidental outcome of a defensive reflex but big boy like bigger after him implicitly accepts complete responsibility for it partly because he is a negro and the white society will accept no mitigating circumstances in his killing of a white person and partly because this inadvertent act has suddenly become something which defines him and enables him to transcend his old life situation at the end of the story big boy is riding in the back of a truck escaping to the north leaving behind him his past and all its limitations this individual course of transcendence and selfemancipation struck out upon in an ultimate gesture of opposition to the white man is the threatening heresy to the communist worldview that wright is about to pursue in his subsequent works of fiction but this is still only at its beginning point the story must have looked orthodox enough to any communist reader containing as it does so many welldrawn elements of the communist vision of the negro an impoverished southern setting a lynching scene and above all a depiction of spontaneous folksolidarity as big boys family and neighbors rally around to help him escape in a manner true to the marxian stress on objectivity wright has chosen a purely external narrative style for this story depicting only acts and circumstances and using pure dialogue through more than twothirds of its length the thoroughly unmarxist subjective focus of native son showing bigger thomas existential sense of mounting liberation and transcendence is entirely missing here this is also the case with his next two major stories which nevertheless continue to explore wrights preoccupation with a vision that centers in his fiction upon the murder of a white man by a negro in both stories the impact of this vision is softened by a pure rarely internalized narrative style and also by the thoroughly mitigating circumstances within which the murder is committed each time mann in down by the riversidesurely the noblest most robesonesque figure of a black man wright ever created has been trapped at home with his pregnant wife by a mississippi flood bringing her to a hospital in a boat borrowed from someone who has stolen it from a white man he encounters its enraged owner who begins shooting at him and whom he kills in selfdefense later after his wife has died and he has been mustered into doing rescue work he willingly saves the life of the daughter of the man he has killed upon their return to dry land she points him out as her fathers murderer and he is shot down by the mob silas in long black song who has been saving his meager earnings for years with the hope of obtaining complete ownership of his farm some day comes home one afternoon to discover that his wife has been raped by a white salesman when the salesman returns the next day silas kills him and then sending his wife and child away to safety he remains to shoot it out with the lynch mob that comes for him ultimately the house is burned to the ground with him inside it in all these three stories the killing at the pivotal point in the narrative is still susceptible of being viewed as the thoroughly provoked uprising of an enraged proletariat an act of solidarity with oppressed workers everywhere white or black when they were assembled and placed alongside fire and cloud the nearest thing to a communist propaganda tract in fiction that wright ever produced in the edition of uncle toms childrenwrights first bookthey did not seem out of place all four stories dealt with southern negroes and were therebv thematicallv connected fur thermore together they suggest that wright had not yet arrived at a firm resolution in his pursuit of the vision that had been disturbing him at least since the rioting over joe louis victory in the fall of for fire and cloud does seem seriously to offer the communist brotherhood as an alternative to some ultimate act of violence as a way for wright to depict a negro achieving full selfrealization in his relations with white men it is only in a fifth story bright and morning star written after the first edition of uncle toms children had gone to press but included in the edition of the book that wright shows clear signs of his coming definitive break with the communist alternative the story begins in a kind of communist euphoria showing a southern negro widow whose two sons have become active in the movement and whose satisfaction with the clandestine life of blackandwhite brotherhood that they have brought her is not diminished by the fact that one of them is in jail for his activities but this idyll is broken by a white informer who has made his way into the movement and into the widows confidence she discovers his identity only after she has given him a list of local party members and after her second son has been captured by a white mob while out trying to warn his comrades of the danger here wright uses a story that as he tells us in black boy he had heard and been profoundly impressed by as a boy in mississippi hiding a gun under a sheet the widow goes forth to where her son is being beaten to death by the mob telling them the sheet is for her sons burial when the informer arrivesshe has gotten there ahead of him by taking a shortcutshe shoots him before he can utter the names of her comrades in the party she is then killed by the mob along with her son for the first time in wrights stories the narrative becomes profoundly subjective in focus her whole being leaped with a will it says at the moment she decides upon her final course of action the long years of her life bent toward a moment of focus a point she had in her heart the whole meaning of her life her entire personality was poised on the brink of a total act this was the realization wright had been groping for all along here fully articulated for the first time and arrived at in a moment of betrayal if not by the communist movement at least by the widows blind faith in it significantly it seems to have been the negro leader benjamin dvis who alone among the party leadership spotted the heresy lurking within this story wright now felt that he knew clearly what he wanted and realized that in all his stories so far he had erred in the direction of sentimentahv when the reviews of uncle toms children began to appear he later wrote in an essay describing the genesis of native son i realized that i had made an awfully naive mistake i found that i had written a book which even bankers daughters could read and weep over and feel good about constance webb tells us that wright began feeling this way after he had received a letter from mrs franklin d roosevelt saying that the book was beautifully written and so vivid that i had a most unhappy time reading it and so now i swore to myself that if i ever wrote another book no one would weep over it that it would be so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears this time there would be no mitigating circumstancesat least not too many surrounding the outburst of black dynamite the result not of one or another immediate provocation but of those four centuries of oppression in a way how bigger was born published in pamphlet form shortly after the appearance of native son is more insistent than the novel is about a reversion to the primitive right of anger describing the various bigger thomass he had known wright often presents someone who goes beyond his novels protagonist in sheer toughness of skin such as this one discovered sitting in the white section of a jim crow streetcar in the south pride and the streetcar moved on its journey without incident this passage seems to be moving toward a vicariousness not unlike that of the boy who sends his big brother out after the block bully a few pages later angrily denouncing the white liberalism of such institutions as the south side boys club where he once worked wright tells how id say to myself go to it boys prove to the bastards that gave you these games that life is stronger than pingpong they did the police blotters of chicago are testimony to how much they did that was the only way i could contain myself for doing a job i hated for a moment id allow myself vicariously to feel as bigger feltnot much just a little just a littlebut still there it was there it was indeed wright was experiencing a prophetic vision of the black ghettos in revolt but what response to this was he seeing in himself ralph ellison has said that he found it disturbing that bigger thomas had none of the finer qualities of richard wright none of the imagination none of the sense of poetry none of the gaiety these were precisely the qualities that wright evidently wanted to strip away in his definitive examination of the meanings of a form of response that he seemed to have glimpsedand to have experienced only vicariously then and ever afterwardson that night in chicago in following joe louis victory over max baer and it was precisely his quality of imagination which enabled him to create an unimaginative character so unlike himself in order to enact this vicarious realization indeed in native son wright almost succeeds in achieving the imaginative liberation he sought by writing it the book eventually runs aground in the authors own intellectuality a quality which for the novels sake he had succeeded in suppressing both too well and not well enough the first twothirds of native son constitute one of the most exciting stretches of melodrama in american literature bigger thomas is hired as a chauffeur by the millionaire dalton a man who maintains his fortune by owning such ratinfested tenements as the one bigger lives in and who eases his conscience by such acts as sending pingpong tables to the south side boys club or hiring negro servants with the intention of helping them to complete their education his first night on the job bigger is assigned to drive daltons twentyyearold daughter mary to an evening class at the university of chicago but she instead directs him to a spot at which they pick up marys boy friend jan erlone a communist the two young whites sit in the front seat with bigger and persuade him to show them around the south side but their protestations of friendship and concern with the plight of the negro succeed only in filling big ger with confusion fear and resentment at the end of the evening after jan has been dropped off bigger discovers to his terror that mary is too drunk to get up to her room without his help filled with apprehension he brings her upstairs and has just stretched her out on the bed when marys mother aroused from her sleep appears at the door of the room mrs dalton is blind and bigger horrified at the prospect of being found in a situation which has traditionally meant death for the black man presses a pillow over the semiconscious marys face to keep her from crying out after mrs dalton leaves bigger discovers that he has killed mary this is the moment when he is transformed until now most of the acts of his life including his accidental killing of mary had been motivated by the fear into which oppression had driven him now suddenly his whole existence had become the determination of his own free and transcendent will released from its lifelong bondage by this single act though he had killed by accident not once did he feel the need to tell himself that it had been an accident he was black and he had been alone in a room where a white girl had been killed therefore he had killed her that was what everybody would say anyhow no matter what he said and in a certain sense he knew that the girls death had not been accidental he had killed many times before only on these other times there had been no handy victim or circumstance to make visible or dramatic his will to kill his crime seemed natural he felt that all of his life had been leading to something like this it was no longer a matter of dumb wonder as to what would happen to him and his black skin he knew now the hidden meaning of his lifea meaning which others did not see and which he had always tried to hidehad spilled out from this moment until biggers capture by the police on a snowcovered tenement rooftop some two hundred pages later the novel is pure movement the kind of overwhelming narrative torrent that wright had already made into a trademark in a story like down by the riverside in native son this narrative flow serves the additional function of showing what has happened to biggers existence every one of his acts now in contrast with the torpor that had prevailed in the descriptions of his life prior to the murder of mary dalton is swift vigorous and meaningful another element in a headlong process of selfdefinition wright spares no horror in this unfolding of the hidden meaning of his protagonists existence biggers ultimate and most completely unforgivable act of violent selfassertion is his murder of his mistress bessie with whom he has shared his secret and whose life has therefore become intolerable to him according to constance webb wright wanted to include this episode in the novel so that there would be no mistaking biggers stark responsibility for his acts no catering to the sensibilities of bankers daughters in retrospect it seems also to be another of the novels prophetic glimpses of the ghetto revolt of the sixties ultimately turning against itself and burning down homes with black women and children inside this then is the culminating act of biggers selfemancipating revolt his one unequivocally wilful act of annihilationperformed upon a poor black workinggirl did wright mean for the irony to read this way is it an intended qualification to his vision of a black revolutionary apocalypse or an inadvertent prophecy miss webb does not tell us but this much must be said if this is ultimately the outcome of biggers revolt then it is not so likely to disturb the sensibilities of bankers daughters after all the last third of the novel dealing with biggers imprisonment and trial is wrights final bout with the communist worldview and the narrative moves slowly and indecisively again wright is more or less victorious this i have come to feel since but he wins only narrowly by a decision rather than with a joe louis knockout blow he seems to want to give what he can back to the communists after the heresy he has committed in the first twothirds of the book it is only they for example who show compassion and some understanding towards bigger and he is deeply appreciative of this despite his refusal to be categorized by them as a mere phenomenon of the oppressed part of mankind i didnt want to kill but what i killed for i am he defiandy tells the communist lawyer to the latters horror jan erlone whose girl friend bigger has murdered and upon whom he had tried to shift the blame for the crime is the very soul of forgiveness the old lawyer max tries to defend bigger from the death sentence in a long courtroom summation indicting societys injustices max is even able to see beneath the blanket of communist myth the more unruly revolutionary force that bigger represents kill this boy he tells the court and makes thousands of other black men and women feel that the barriers are tighter and higher kill him and swell the tide of pentup lava that will some day break loose not in a single blundering accidental individual crime but in a wild cataract of emotion that will brook no control but ultimately it is max who comes forth not only in the courtroom but within wrights internal moral dialectic as the last defender of the old vision of a coalition of the oppressed bigger dont you know they hate others too who they hate they hate trade unions they hate folks who try to organize but they hate black folks more than they hate unions bigger said they dont treat union folks like they do me oh yes they do you think that because your color makes it easier for them to point you out segregate you exploit you but they do that to others too they hate me because im trying to help you theyre writing me letters calling me a dirty jew it seems to me that this passage is demonstrative of wrights ambivalence about the clean break he is here trying to make with the vision represented by communism today we can see as clearly through some of maxs nineteenthirties myths as wright was doing then they certainly do hate black folks more than they hate unions furthermore in america they hate negroes more than they hate jews but europe in was something else again jews had already been made into the negroes of nazi germany as an overture to mass slaughter wright was undoubtedly sensitive to this as he always was to a european perspective upon things indeed this sensitivity was communisms permanent legacy to him for he had no sooner broken a few years after this with the essentially european mythsystem that communism represented than he went to europe and absorbed a new set of its myths to explain the world the spirit of max partly consumed in a european nostalgia shared by every american jewish intellectual was never completely exorcised by wright he had absorbed this nostalgia as part of his education and his vision of black revolt was as blurred by it as his pursuit of the vision was spurred by a passion to shake it off this is the meaning of biggers final but somehow inconclusive show of defiance before max in his death cell ending with a faint wry bitter smile through the bars as the lawyer walks down the corridor here is the way wrights revolt ends not with a bang but a smirk ralph ellison has pointed out the basic ambiguity of native son wherein in order to translate biggers complicated feelings into universal ideas wright had to force into biggers consciousness concepts and ideas which his intellect could not formulate between wrights skill and knowledge and the potentials of biggers mute feelings lay a thousand years of conscious culture in his search after a certain notion of the primitive wright had come dangerously close to creating a character who was a mere vehicle for ideas bigger still works despite the ambiguity but wrights growing preoccupation with the metaphysics of blackness turned many of the characters he subsequently created into hardly more than metaphors constance webb tells us that in the years immediately following the publication of native sonthe war years wright completed another lengthy manuscript for a novel about a woman who whitened her skin by taking arsenic wafers orally which was never published even though its author was now famous wright also published a long short story in this period the man who lived underground which is about a negro who escaping from a false murder charge takes refuge in a sewer from there he sees numerous vignettes of the life of the city through cellar openings and holes in walls it is an interesting attempt to use blackness as a metaphor for the condition known in jewish literature as that of one who sees but is not seen but the ideaoriginally inspired by a reading of dostoyevskyis more appealing than the realization is successful and it was eventually to be used to much better effect bv ralph ellison with whom wright apparently often discussed its mplications black boy published in wrights first book to appear in the five years since native sonis his masterpiece and yet it would seem from miss webbs narrative that it was written almost inadvertently after wrights agent surprised him by suggesting that he try an autobiography persuaded to drop the mantle of a writer of fiction for a moment although he uses the techniques of the novel here most effectively wright has recourse in this book to telling it like it is without drawing upon his arsenal of symbolism and melodramatic plotmaking a simple and powerful account of his boyhood and young manhood in the south it is his one booklength narrative that does not border on solipsism but contains a whole array of real characterizations even the whites that appear almost all of them as persecutors are more real and hence human than such caricatures as dalton or the private detective in native son focusing more resolutely on real experience than he had ever done before wright had lighted upon conventions that were for the first time entirely his own evoking as ellison says the paradoxical almost surreal image of a black boy singing the blues lustily as he probes his own grievous wound the book suggests possibilities for a whole genre of negro writing signs of which we are now beginning to see today but in wrights own life and work black boy proved to be the swan song of his struggle to achieve his own identity as a writer and a man in america in the latter half of he visited france as the guest of its government and in the summer of the following year he brought his wife and fiveyearold daughter to paris to settle there for good having found life as a negro in america intolerable enoush for himself he came to feel that he could not conceive of it for his daughter france had presented to him the prospect of an entirely different way of life he would be an outsider there too but more as an exiled american intellectual than as a negro although france is far from colorblind it is at any rate less colorconscious than almost any other western nation furthermore within that most remarkable of meltingpots the paris intelligentsiaby whom wright had been warmly received during his visithis color did not stand so much for a complex and burdensome ethnic fact as for a principle of sartrean authenticity it was a mere outward representation of some particular angle of vision within the universalist brotherhood of leftbank artists and intellectuals by merely trading in the lilt with which he once had sung the blues wright became eligible to put on the frenchmade mantle of negri tude whose graceful and classic lines obscured the homely contours of mississippi and chicago in other words his color became in france what he had always sought to make it a kind of metaphor this transmutation is reflected in wrights next book the outsider published in his first in eight years it is a novel laden with language and concepts borrowed from french existentialism discussions of bad faith a title from camus letranger better known in english as the stranger can also be translated the outsider even a district attorney who says to the protagonist that he has committed the greatest crime of all because you didnt bat your eye when i told you that your mother was dead cross damon a new variant of bigger thomas perceived through the french philosophical sensibility commits a series of murders that read like ritual metaphors for the series of rejections wright had made in his own life damon begins by murdering himself as it were narrowly escaping with his life from a chicago train accident he discovers that another passenger who was killed has been mistaken for him and he decides to accept this going later to watch his own funeral from a distance then damon is recognized by a friend whom he encounters by chance and he kills him rather than have to return to a life he had found intolerable he leaves his native chicago and goes to new york where under an assumed identity he becomes involved with communists a young communist couple gil blount ne bernstein and his wife eva take him in as a boarder in order to challenge the racist policies of their landlord enraged at the sight of a negro in his building the landlord gets into a fight with blount and damon when he discovers the two of them lying unconscious from each others blows finishes the job and kills them botha plague on both their houses the next day damon kills another communist who is suspicious of him and becomes the lover of blounts widow eva for an outsider sans identity any expression of his contempt for the worlds myths has been possible but now he shows one fatal weakness he falls in love with eva and is broken when she commits suicide after learning the truth about him this is his one display of humanity in the whole novel in the end it is not the law but the communists who destroy him shooting him down in the street the thrust of wrights work had now brought him to a point of extreme alienation his next novel savage holidaywhich appeared directly in a paperback edition because his regular publisher harper brothers would not handle it is a suspense thriller about a retired white insurance executive who stepping out of the shower to pick up his newspaper in the hallway one sunday morning finds himself trapped there naked when his door accidentally slams shut caught naked in the hallwaythis is what had become of wrights creative metaphor of his very inner identity during the next few years wright made strenuous efforts to recover roots for a theme that had now become in literary terms a mere abstraction in he visited the future republic of ghana as the guest of prime minister nkrumah and wrote a book about his observations under the prophetic title black_power continuing to pursue the possibilities of reportage as a literary outlet for himself he undertook two major journeys in pursuit of material during the summer and fall of to spain and to the bandung conference as the title of his book pagan spain indicates his trip to that countrythe one country of the western world about which as though shunning the memory of a bad love affair i did not until now want to exercise my mind was a recapitulation of his old question for a primitive reality behind the mask of communist myth pagan spain whose border with france marks the termination of europe and the beginning of africa was the dark truth that had reposed beneath the rightleft conventions of the spanish civil war era so also at the bandung conference did wright perceive an underlying realityformed out of race and religionthat was beyond left and right he was thus moving in the direction of what was in fact another leftwing myth that of the third worldwhich was being generated in france during this period it was a possible outcome of the logic of his own development in a sense bigger thomas could be viewed retrospectively as a representative of frantz fanons theories about the selfrealization of the colonized through violent revolt but this in the end would tend to make biaser as much a creature of jeanpaul sartres universe as the lawyer max had wanted to make him of the universe of american communism in the nineteenthirties wright did not seem content with this resolution either he had been very keenly aware for example of the gulf between himself and the black man of africa during his trip there the short time that now remained of his life was filled with what seems to have been a frantic struggle to recover his themes as he thrashed about through possibilities both old and new he tried writing again about the negro in the american south but the resulting novel the long dream published in was severely criticized for its manifest remoteness from reality it was far more popular in france than in the united states his short stories mere fanciful creations were better because they were able to bear up somehow under the weight of being intellectual constructs a story published in big black good man suggests the possibility that the course of wrights sensibility was seeking to come full circle it tells of an elderly hotel clerk in denmark who is terrified one night by an enormous black man who comes asking for a room and a prostitute the clerk becomes obsessed with this giant whose sexuality seems to be as overwhelming as his appearance as he fills his order night after night then one evening as if in fulfillment of a recurring nightmare the negro comes in and wraps his huge hands about the clerks throat but takes them away momentarily and leaves it is only after months in which the clerk has endless morbid fantasies about him that the negro returns to the hotel again beckons to the clerk andpresents him with some shirts in gratitude for services rendered the terrifying hands around the clerks neck had been estimating his shirt size the frightening guest was a big black good man after all does the similarity of name to those of big boy and bigger suggest what wright was trying to do it is one of his few stories displaying some of the sunniness and humor for which he was apparently well known in person was he making his peace at last and if so where was it to take him no one will ever know for he was dead three years later in the fall of in the posthumous collection of richard wrights short stories that was published in eight men the final piece called the man who went to chicago is not a work of fiction but a memoir an excerpt from the final and unpublished third of his manuscript for black boy it tells among other things of a brief period shortly after his arrival in chicago from the south when he held a job as a clerk in a delicatessen run by an elderly jewish couple the relations between them and himself that he describes are an odd mixture of decency and strained understanding his employers were kind but not always patient he for his own part guiltily remembered some of the antisemitic folklore of his childhood one day mrs hoffman asked him to go to a nearby store to pick up a can of cheek keen awr lar keeng utterly baffled he asked her to repeat this several times until she lost her temper crying dont you know nosing when he asked her to write it down she protested that she was unable to write finally he learned the syllables by rote went on his errand and was handed a can of chicken a la king muttering curses on the way back he reflected bitterly though english was my native tongue and america my native land she an alien could operate a store and earn a living in a neighborhood where i could not even live i reasoned further that she was aware of this and trying to protect her position against me shortly after that when the time came for a scheduled civil service exam he took off from work three days in a row to prepare for it and take it not wanting the hoffmans to know he was looking for another job he told them the next day that his mother had died and he had gone to memphis for the funeral but they did not believe him the more they refused to accept his story the more he persisted in it until mrs hoffman protested we treat you nice dont we his anger at them grew with his shame and at the end of the week when his civil service job came up he left them without even saying he would not be back the next day it was not until i had left the delicatessen job that i saw how grossly i had misread the motives and attitudes of mr hoffman and his wife i had not yet learned anything that would have helped me to thread my way through these perplexing racial relations accepting my environment at its face value trapped by my own emotions i kept asking myself what had black people done to bring this crazy world upon them i know the hoffmans because they are in a sense my parents and i too have rejected them werent they also the parents of jan erlone and the lawyer maxs cousins perhaps they were among the storekeepers who gazed out their windows with blanched faces at the rioters the night of joe louis victory over max baer a lot has happened since then and they are long since gone or going those elderly storekeepers some bearing the scars of their munderstandings others unreconciled but all all passing to the next generation a challenge with which it was difficult for them to cope has the time come to find peace in that legacy is this what wright was trying to come back to from the lonely exile into which that old strife had driven him the strident voices of black selfassertion and the bittersweet f gropings towards afroamerican identity which now fill the i dark ghettos of the nation seem to provide a strange and a most embarrassing backdrop to the largely unnoticed approach of another negro history week indeed the juxtaposition of such a typically american institution against the broad panorama of our newest coming of blackness is likely a testimony to a frame of mind which must not go unchallenged at so pregnant a moment in the nations life evidently there are many wellmeaning persons who think of negro history in the context of the overall american story in much the same way that they think of individual negroes and their integration into the american society that is they are adamantly and often vociferously in favor of small but prominent doses of negro history being dropped into the national saga but they insist that these black drops should never be numerous or indelible for if they are too many and too black they might necessitate unpleasant rereadings reassessments and rewritings of the entire story and such adjustments would never be tolerated by the american society to say nothing of the historical professionor so the unspoken lines seem to go it is my thesis and partly the motivation for my work that an american history which cannot contain the full story of the black pilgrimage is no more worthy of life than an american society that cannot bear the full and troublesome black presence in its midst indeed it is my intention to suggest that just as america can know no survival worth considering unless it finds a way of facing its black counterimage so too our history is a tale told by fools if it does not incorporate the afroamerican experience with unflinching integrity and if such open encounter between black and white american history should produce the same sense of insecure teetering on the edge of the unknown as we now experience in the human encounter so much the better nor does the analogy end there the urgency some of us feel for the creation of such a new american history is no less critical than the pressure that impels us to seek for the lineaments of a new american society obviously the tasks are not unrelated for there will be no new beginnings for a nation that refuses to acknowledge its real past therefore the uses of the afroamerican past are many varied and crucial at this difficult but inevitable juncture in american life they will be examined here in stages ranging from the obvious to the enigmatic at that end of the continuum most flooded with the light of reason it should be clear that any american history that ignores the central role of black people as actors and foils on this maddening stage is a falsified and misleading history it is for instance a history that ignores the ironic symbol of that summer in jamestown more than three centuries ago when representative government and african bondsmen had a mutual beginning of sorts in the citadel of colonial democracy a beginning that seemed to lock the rhetoric of democracy and the reality of black inequality into the american heart it is a history that tries to explore the making of the constitution without understanding the major price in its integrity that was exacted by the system of slavery and its proponents both north and south it is a history that attempts to speak of the peculiar institution as if there were no human beings involved who produced no authentic historical materials thus a major publisher could attempt last year to produce a collection of documents on slavery without one document from a slave it is a history that speaks of jacksonian democracy as if the expanded white franchise were not purchased at the cost of the black northern vote in many states such a vacuous history treats reconstruction as if it were another unfortunate mistake rather than one of the nations greatest lost chances to be honest and free it is a history that deals with the turn of the nineteenth century without suggesting the way in which the rising tide of brutality against blacks and indians at home may have permanently poisoned the nations attempts at expansion among nonwhite peoples elsewhere it is a history that tries to understand the urban crisis of the s without tracing the long and bloody lines of negro migration since reconstruction it is a history that attempts to interpret current american culture without any appreciation for the major role black people have played in creating the popular culture of the nation especially since the s it may well be that a history without the afroamerican story cannot offer sufficient insights into the reasons why the nation can now be so numb to the brutalization of a vietnam thousands of miles away perhaps it cannot understand this because it denies the physical and spiritual destruction of black persons which has become a part of the american way of life and has likely created a callous on whatever heart a nation has it is such a history that has contributed immensely to the miseducation of the american people and has brought them so unprepared to face a world that is neither white christian capitalist nor affluent such history may yet prove poisonous and if there is any possible antidote on the american scene it could be the hard and bitter medicine of the afroamerican past is it too late for a society that still insists that its drops be few and painless this question will be examined more fully below now it is important to recognize another obvious use of the afroamerican past even when one acknowledges how grotesquely slow is the pace at which black people are moving on to the american stage the knowledge of their history is still absolutely indispensable as they proceed it is essential on the one hand to the oldnew comers as they cast off the roles of the past and seek for new ones if they come to the integrated scene with integrity they must come with a knowledge of themselves and of the manysplendored gifts they bring black students in formerly white schools must not enter as suppliants who are going to be transformed from disadvantaged to advantaged buy such a move they must be so aware of their black fathers and the wealth of their soiritual and intellectual heritage that they will sharply illuminate the disadvantages inherent in an isolated beleaguered middleclass white world if they are to become more than black anglosaxons and god knows we have enough white ones without adding carbon copies then they cannot accept the old doctrines of slavery which encouraged them to believe that god somehow blessed darkest africa with the light of christian guns and shins and chains neither the ancient kingdom of songhai nor the modern kingdom of harlem was benighted without whites and black young people need to know the measurements of the lightin both places any society that would encourage black children to live in a state of permanent amnesia or shameor bothconcerning their fathers and their fathers ways of life is a society not worth knowing any men who would enter such a society on its amnesiac terms would only add to its corruption whether they entered through the door of the ninth grade or by the carpeted way of a general electric executive suite but it must also be acknowledged that such knowledge is exceedingly dangerous for if it were faithfully presented a reading of the afroamerican past might cause black exiles to refuse many an open door indeed some doors might be torn from their hinges nor would this be teaching hatred of whites rather it would be the necessary and healthy explanation for the existence of the hatred and fear that most black men have known from childhood on any society lacking the courage to take such risks with light lacks the courage to live on the other obvious hand those white persons who first encounter the token blacks in their new roles are also in desperate need of the afroamerican past for without it they will be tempted to feel that they are doing a favor for the students or the junior executives by letting them in properly read the pages of the negro past will reveal that it is black people who have done the favor by doing so much to build the nation under such horrible circumstances and by letting such ambiguous doors stay on their hinges for so long a time compassionately understood the black past will teach all benefactors that they are receiving a favor in being allowed what may be the one last chance to do justice that they are being graced by the presence of a people whose pilgrimage is perhaps the only true epic poem that america has ever known such a reading of the afroamerican past might even shatter the general illusion that token acceptance of token negroes will ever bring any basic hope for the survival of any of us perhaps the issue of survival suggests another level of our need for he story of this dark journey in america not long ago the most highly esteemed newspaper in america asked an author to write his reflections on the reasons for the current breaking of america into two parts based on race when it rips apart all the easy generalizations of our textbooks written largely by for and about white america the new coming of black history would cast such a question into limbo for any perceptive apprehension of the negrowhite encounter cannot fail to reveal that there have always been two major communities in this nationbased on race the breaking began in west africa and continued in every colony and state that came into being if we read with both speed and comprehension it may not be too late to ask the right questions questions based not on newark or detroit in but on jamestown and philadelphia and springfield and st louis over the centuries for it is only as america faces a denmark vesey a nat turner a w e b du bois a paul robeson and a malcolm_x that the nation will begin to be ready to understand a stokely carmichael a rap brown and the host of black radicals yet to come such a reading would identify each one as made in america product of its broken community how shall this land create new and whole men if it refuses to examine its past production record a record strewn with the crushed bodies and spirits of black radicals hurling defiant curses and urgent pleas for renewal from the same dying lips at the identical insistent moment it is these angry young men whose lives demonstrate the fact that the afroamerican past and the black present are no longer matters of limited national concernif they ever were indeed they suggest to us what may be one of the most profound and universally significant uses of this history that is its service as an entrance to the nonwhite nonwestern world let me elaborate on what i mean one of the most gifted and least celebrated american political analysts used to say that the basic division in the world now and for some time to come was not based on communism versus capitalism rather a j muste said the world was divided now between those peoples who had rarely if ever known defeat and humiliation as a national experience and those who had lived with this for centuries in a sense muste was simply echoing the profound insights expressed by w e b du bois half a century earlier however formulated the concepts of these men remind us that the world experience of the last years has meant that the vast majority of the earths humiliated people have been nonwhite and their humiliation has come at the hands of the white western world moreover it appears that this nation now stands as the selfproclaimed leader of that unhumiliated world and finds itself at once the most powerful and one of the least comprehending national states it is obvious that one of americas most critical blind areas is in the realm of understanding the oppressed the wretched of the earth our vaunted experience of virtually unbroken success our alabaster cities undimmed by human tears except for the unseen tears of the poor and the black and our movement into the strange joys of advanced corporate capitalismall these have cut this people off from the rest of the world in significant ways if there is any real concern among the american people to understand why men are determined to fight bombers with rifles and curses why revolutions seem to grow up wherever americas footprints mark the earth then the afroamerican story is essential reading for here in the heart of america is the nations major link to the alienated humiliated and rebellious nonwhite world its story is at once tied to the nonwest and a part of the american past indeed richard wright says the history of black folk is the history of america written in bloody terms a failure to explore this vital link on its own terms through its own history might well prove disastrous not only within the nation but at every troubled spot where this nation reaches out its ambiguous hands beyond the west without such an exploration we might continue to be puzzled at the worlds disbelief concerning our sudden devotion to the rights of selfdetermination for the nonwhite masses of vietnam a nation that combines the american predilection towards violence the american stockpile of weapons and the american lack of empathy for the earths humiliated peoples is a dangerous nation perhaps it can begin another life by introducing itself to the invisible men in its midst by seeking to know the quality of suffering and hurt and the rebellion they spawn such an introduction must includeif not begin withthe past nor are black americans excused from such a task for we are constantly exposed to a terrible temptation to forget the black and bloody ground out of which we sprang as the price for american acceptance as du bois put it more than a decade ago most american negroes even those of intelligence and courage do not fully realize that they are being bribed to trade equal status in the united states for the slavery of the majority of men so the afroamerican past must remind black people that we are children of the humiliated and the oppressed that our fathers were colonized and exploited subjects and that the ghettos we have recently left are still too often filled with the stench of poverty and despair such history must remind afroamericans that all of our greatest leaders have begged us to stand in solidarity with the black and anguished people of the earth we are their spokesmen in the midst of the worlds foremost antirevolutionary power if we forsake them we forsake our past our fathers and our own best selves if we forsake them there may be no future for our children or theirs if we forget our own fathers burnings in village squares and on american uniforms to set fires against the worlds desperate revolutions we will deserve nothing but the scorn of men and the judgement of the gods reference to the nations lack of empathy with the desperate men of the earth suggests yet another closely related use of the afroamerican past some years ago d w brogan that english expert on american affairs referred to what he called the myth of american omnipotence his use of this phrase referred of course to his conviction that the reading of the american past was distorted by a conception of this nation as an entity incapable of failure powerful and pure enough to succeed at anything it chose the corollary of this myth said brogan in the days of mccarthys reign was that any american failure at home or overseas had to be explained by subversion or conspiracies orat worsta mistake in wellintentioned american judgement now related to brogans myth is what might be called the myth of american romanticism ever since the nations beginning it has been plagued by this equally crippling misconception of itself succinctly put this misconception involves a belief that american history is the story of a society moving on a straight upward line from perfection to perfection from goodness to betterness from being better than other nations to being the best and most complete nation that god had ever stood over i take it that is the implication of being under god this mythology was intensified to the point of indoctrination after world war ii when history became a tool of the cold war and it became necessary to prove consistently the superiority of america over every conceivable communist socialist or neutralist model in the world this is a selfimage on the level with fairy tales and happiness forever after it is the selfunderstanding of those whose adult development has been aborted by the fear of the risks of growth most importantly it is a refusal to recognize the bloody tragic line that whips its way through all of life failure to face the tragic is failure to mature in national as well as personal spheres so in the midst of this pabulum view of history a serious implanting of the afroamerican past could be the difference between death and growthat least spiritually for if there is any story that would fling america up against the tragic elements of her history it is the story of that oldnew people created here by force annealed by the heat of suffering into afroamericans were american historians and american citizens at large to face this story manyif not allof their liberal superficial myths about and hopes foramerican society might be transformed they would need to face again the fact that two of their greatest heroes jefferson and lincoln were convinced that black and white people could never live on a basis of true equality in america they would be pressed to realize that the great emancipator cared far more deeply for a cheaply won white reconciliation than for the very costly black liberation thereby helping to lead the nation down bloody paths of malice for all the close reading of the black past might reveal how fully this broken people has tested every line of american democratic rhetoric and how fully each word has shrunken before the ultimate test in every generation they would also see the pathetic and perennial sight of esteemed national leaders offering solutions a generation old to wounds long past such ancient salves a reading of the black preachers poets and editors a sensitive listening to the singers of our songs would face the nation with the ceaseless rage that has been the lot of men in every strange land who have been called upon to sing to dance to laugh and to be grateful and in those pages any searching eye would easily spy the centuryold predictions of black alienation sedition rebellion and guerrilla warfare disaster has always lurked at the american door tragic disaster created largely by blindness to the nations fatal flaw not only would the tragic nature of american life perhaps become more clear but the afroamerican story would remind the nation that it was conceived as an experiment an experiment that could yet fail miserably utterly explosively almost a century ago henry adams described the america of as very healthy except for the cancer of slavery the irony and the tragedy of a very healthy cancerous body is still the american condition and though no cure has yet been found for the cancer it may not be too late to open the blind eyes to see its sources in the past and what if we open our eyes only to discover that jefferson and lincoln and many black men were right that present white prejudice and black bitterness and unbroken lines of injustice from the past now make it impossible for us to continue together in integrity is it better to go on in blind selfrighteous rage towards internecine struggle or to see finally see with sad and mature clarity the pathway down from all our past romantic dreamsincluding the dream of integration the black experience in america allows for no illusions not even that last ancient hope of the chosen american people whom god will somehow rescue by a special act of his grace america began with such hopes but they were tied to the idea of a covenant that men would have to do gods will for them to remain as his chosen ones somehow just as america forced black men to do so much of its other dirty but productive work the nation evidently came to believe that whites could be chosen while blacks did that suffering which has always been identified with the chosen ones now that is over the black past has begun to explode and to reveal to a hiding chosen people that to be the annointed one is to be crushed and humiliated by the forces of the world after almost years how significant a period of exile the black branch of the chosen people has grown louder than ever before in its refusal to take the sufferings apart from the privileges of the chosen status so it may be that for all who see it the afroamerican past illuminates the meaning of being chosen perhaps this is what white americans must see that they will either join the ranks of suffering and humiliation beginning perhaps with losing face in vietnam or there will be no chosen people on these shores either they will submit their children to some of the same educational terrors they have allowed black children to endure or there is no future for any either they will give up their affluence to provide necessities for others or there will be neither affluence nor necessities for anyone perhaps we were chosen together and we cannot move towards a new beginning until we have faced all the horror and agony of the past with absolute honesty perhaps integration is indeed irrelevant until the assessment of a long unpaid debt has been made and significant payments begun perhaps atonement not integration is the issue at hand of course one last shattering possibility may remain it could be that the message of the afroamerican past is this only one branch of the chosen people has really paid the dues of sufferingwith the scars to show for it therefore it may be that only the black branch will be allowed to shape the future of the nation and to determine its calling for the world perhaps only black people are open enough and sensitive enough and scarred enough as a group to lead this nation into true community with the nonwhite humiliated world perhaps that world of sufferers will trust no american leaders save those who bear the marks of oppression in their souls perhaps it will listen only to those who know the tragic sense of life and are not blind and calloused bearers of death perhaps it is already time for the last to be first in our nation how shall that overturning come that knowledge may be too great for even the afroamericans past to bear perhaps our black history can only bear witness to the truth and living men must shape that truth into new action and new history to those who would close their ears to such interpretations of the black past to those who would tune out because such strange musings seem unrelated to the historians vocation i would leave you only with the word of a white radical who read black history with some care before an audience of wellmeaning whites in a time of similar crisis he spoke on the afroamerican past focussing on the greatness of a black leader named toussaint holding louverture above the great white heroes of the age then wendell phillips set out these words you think me a fanatic tonight for you read history not with your eyes but with your prejudices so spoke a man who believed that there was no healing for america either in small black drops of history or in small black drops of negro freedom had the nation heard his word and followed his uses of the past we might well have been spared most of the bloody days between and the terrorfilled nights yet to come will there be time before the last night we who are black we who have lived in night and waited long in darkness may have a special word of light for a stumbling powerbound people we do not panic easily shall the word be heard only those with ears can say it is our calling our vocation to speak it and if the last darkness should fall it is preferable that we be found standing faithful to all the agonizing sorrowjoy of our afroamerican past than lost and sullen black defenders of a world that sucked out our memory and bleached our minds such a land deserves no defense better that it pass and make way for whatever is yet to comeeven if it be the longdelayed last silence or will it be the drums of morning i do not know the afroamerican past leaves a man with no illusions but even in the heart of chaos it does not strip him of his hope we have come too far through too much chaos to cop out here until about years ago negro historians were almost j it t z totally ignored by white historians and their various historj i i f ical associations although many negro historians had been v jfj trained at the best american universities they were not con sidered objective enough to write negro history and it went without saying that negro historians could not write about whites there was an upper class snoobishness in the white historians holding history as the grandest and most exclusive of the scholarly disciplines and so although negro historians have a long and outstanding history and are responsible for nearly all truthful negro history the writing about them by negroes and whites has been fragmentary there are the scattered notes on negro historians in vernon loggins the negro author his development in america up to and in john hope franklins from slavery to freedom joseph grimes page unpublished masters thesis a study of the negro historian university of iowa a brief introductory section on the negro historian in the negro caravan two articles by helen boardman and carter g woodson on the rise of the negro historian and negro historians of our time respectively negro history bulletin april a section of herbert apthekers article negro history arsenal for liberation new masses feb on negro historians e e thorpes article on negro writers of negro church history southern university bulletin fall and occasional articles on individual negro historians such as george washington williams william wells brown and carter g woodson in the journal of negro history and other periodicals and that was all of the bibliography until the negro scholar e e thorpes small book negro historians in the united states was published in since then we have had sections of thorpes the mind of the negro and august meiers negro thought in america devoted to negro historians the first negro history was written by negro and white defenders of the race early in the nineteenth century as mostly biographical sketches of distinguished negroes this work was the american counterpart of abbe gregoires de la litterature des negres translated in the first two works by negroes that could be called history were paul cuffes brief account of the settlement and present situation of the colony of sierra leone in africa published in and prince saunders haytian papers a collection of very interesting proclamations and other official documents together with some account of the rise progress and present state of the kingdom of haiti published in in london and in america later came robert b lewis light and truth in republished in in an enlarged edition the first extensive effort of an american negro to dig into the story of his past in j w c pennington published a history for school children arranged in questionanswer form titled a text book of the origin and history of the colored people also in james mccune smith gave a lecture of the hayden revolution with a sketch of toussaint louverture pennington published his slave narrative the fugitive blacksmith in as did many other negro exslaves who wrote or dictated narratives both before and after penningtons the most important of these is the narrative of frederick douglass which went through three different editions over the years the first negro to do the research and interpretation of a historian was william c nell whose pamphlet services of colored americans in the wars of and was published in and a larger revised book edition of this later in titled the colored patriots of the american revolution with sketches of several distinguished colored persons to which is added a brief survey of the condition and prospects of colored americans here the main themes that were to be the chief concerns of the negro historian for a long time were set forth the negros military service biographical sketches of the few distinguished negroes and the united states race problem an early work dealing with the last of these three themes is the condition elevation emigration and destiny of the colored people of the united states politically considered by martin r delany a negro physician and cofounder and assistant editor of frederick douglass newspaper north star delany also wrote blake or the huts of america the third novel by an american negro the second novel was frank w webbs the garies and their friends there were early negro church historians christopher rush an early church worker and a founder of the phoenix society in wrote with george collins the history of the ame church in republished in william t catto in wrote the history of the first african presbyterian church in philadelphia and william douglass recorded in the annals of the first african church in the usa other negro church historians will be taken up later william wells brown abolitionist lecturer and writer and author of clotel or the presidents daughter the first novel by an american negro in turned early to the writing of history he published his historical lecture st domingo its revolutions and its patriots emphasizing toussaint louverture in and the black man his antecedents his genius and achievements more biographical than historical in these were followed by the negro in the american rebellion his heroism and his fidelity the first book of the records of negro troops contrabands and slaves during the civil war and later in the rising son or the antecedents and advancement of the colored race a large work that included much that had gone into the earlier books william still an antislavery negro worker in philadelphia kept in a secret place voluminous records of the fugitive slaves and their rescuers from to in he compiled his thick volume the underground railroad a record of facts authentic narratives letters etc republished in joseph t wilson the negro historian of the grand army of the republic wrote several histories just after this j including emancipation its course and progress from bc to ad and the black phalanx a history of the negro in the civil war but pennington nell brown and still were more abolitionists than historians edward w blyden was academically equipped to write history but he wrote mostly about the problems of the colony of liberia west africa and africa in general the first negro historian whose scholarship made him worthy of serious attention was george washington williams a pennsylvanian and a civil war soldier who had been educated in massachusetts aware of the importance of structure as well as the researching of facts williams made his twovolumed history of the negro race in america from to a landmark in historical writing which is still useful today he followed this up with a history of the negro troops in the war of the rebellion a book that was still considered until recently by many as the best book on the negro in the civil war williams won recognition from the white literary world he was called the negro bancroft there were other biographical historical works by negroes during this period such as william j simmons men of mark a dictionary of negro biography john wallaces carpetbag rule in florida reprinted in about reconstruction in florida and e a johnsons a school history of the negro race in america there were later negro church histories such as daniel a paynes history of the a me church j w hoods history of the amez church bishop charles henry phillips history of the colored methodist episcopal church in america and other church works by b t tanner and lewis j jordan there were also several good biographies of john brown at this time by the white writers f b sanborn r j hinton james redpath w e connelley and others but the first scientific study of negro history was w e b du bois doctoral dissertation in history at harvard university the suppression of the african slavetrade to the united states of america published in as volume one in the harvard historical studies series authoritative and scholarly and written by one of the giants of negro history this work was reprinted in by the social science press and in by russell and russell both in new york city the period from the late s through the s was one in which great efforts were made by negroes to write about their own history and culture and to counter the terrible racist propaganda spewed by u s books newspapers and magazines at that time the american negro historical society of philadelphia was organized in to collect relics and facts of negro progress and development the more influential negro society for historical research was started by j e bruce and a a schomburg in and the association for the study of negro life and history was organized by carter g woodson in some of the earlier books of negro history by negroes during this period after the du bois work of are w h councills lamp of wisdom or race history

not get the financial support he needed to complete the project at that time but he did read a paper on reconstruction and its benefits before the american historical association in du bois published in that very important pioneering anthropological book on african history in the home university library series titled the negro and the gift of black folk negroes in the making of america in the latter had historical chapters on black explorers and other negro subjects another giant of negro history was carter g woodson who worked his way up from former slave parents through the west virginia

du bois great work black reconstruction in america reprinted in in paperback and and the whitie marxist writer james s allens important reconstruction the battle for democracy reprinted in and two books that defended the role of negroes and radical republicans during reconstruction and repudiated the widespread opinion of the period as a tragic era productive only of evil and corruption these two works rescued reconstruction from the dominant white historiography and forced american historians to revise and reconsider their biased work on this period an encyclopedia of the negro edited by du bois and guy b johnson and sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund was started in but was published only in outline form in revised edition in the white writer wilbur h siebert author of the underground railroad brought out much later his three books of the underground railroad in massachusetts in vermont and in ohio the white anthropologist ina corinne browns the story of the american negro appeared

dissertation and definitive work american negro slaves revolts was published in and twice reprinted and kept in print by another publisher in and aptheker in the meantime had been publishing three other pamphlets the negro in the civil war the negro in the american revolution and the negro in the abolitionist movement he pulled these four pamphlets or long essays together in the book essays in the history of the american negro aptheker was to author or edit other important works in negro history such as to be free studies in american negro history essays that broke new ground a documentary

states though sociological in its approach has important historical material and must be included here the famous negro historian john hope franklin started in the s with the publication of his doctoral dissertation the free negro in north carolina in he followed this up with what has thus far been his magnum opus from slavery to freedom a history of american negroes reprinted in and a fairly comprehensive and useful summary of negro history especially up to franklin has since authored or edited the diary of james t ayers civil war recruiter the militant south reconstruction after the civil war and the emancipation proclamation plus many scholarly articles he wrote the original not final draft of the u s commission on civil_rights report freedom to the free a centennial progress report of negroes since emancipation franklin is one of the three authors of the big pioneering integrated junior high school history textbook land of the free he also edited with isidore starr the negro in twentieth century america a reader on the struggle for civil_rights there were important contributions to negro history by white historians other than aptheker during the forties

whose unpublished doctoral dissertation now in microfilm is a survey of the negro convention movement miss gross has also done important exhaustive work on james mccune smith and other important figures of negro history which should be published the works of white historians however were even more numerous during the fifties philip s foner is a prolific marxist historian whose doctoral dissertation business and slavery the new york merchants and the irrepressible conflict was published in just after this he brought out selections from the writings of frederick douglass and abraham lincoln in a pamphlet series that also included thomas jefferson and george washington foners great work in the negro history field is the fourvolumed fairly definitive life and writings of frederick

children in an article in the journal of negro history had called for a new interpre tation for negro history as early as in john hope franklin described new perspectives in american negro history social education and later in described the more understanding studies of the negro by white historians at that time as what actually happened to american negroes or the new negro history crisis some historians disagreed and thought that franklins claims were greatly exaggerated but some improvement had definitely taken place in the writing of negro history although there was still a long way to go in the s white historians were to do even better on a whole than they had done in the s with of course some serious regressions in both decades which we wont discuss here the civil_rights struggle of the fifties and sixties had brought in its wake a more accurate history of the negro people even by white historians the negro historians of these two decades we shall discuss later in any event there was a virtual floodtide some of the works of the sixties by white historians were j w schulte nordholts the people that walk in darkness a history of the negro people in america a john brown

vanguard vs states that negroes were far from controlling southern politics is attested by the small number sent to washington in the four years following the war congress contained no negroes at all and in the next eight years the average was six during the reconstruction years only two negro senators were seated and representatives six from south carolina where the black population was heaviest and political activity most aggressive nine of the former slave states had no negro congress at all in the reconstruction years in the years after termination of the radical program negroes averaged only two seats per congress and in the next decade there was never more than one to represent the nations negroes by that time grown to more than n in the south between and there were negro congressmen and two senators namely hiram r revels and blanche k bruce both of mississippi revels was born of free parents in north carolina and bruce was born a slave in virginia see list at end of article which shows births and deaths of all negro congressmen during the period covered by this paper american historians generally have portrayed reconstruction era negro officials as illiterate clowns butlike so much of our history myth was allowed to overshadow fact hiram rhoades revels was the first negro to serve in the united states senate when revels took his seat in the senate he was fulfilling prophecy senator simon cameron told senator jefferson davis in when he left the senate after mississippi seceded from the union i believe in the justice of god that a negro some day will come and occupy your seat a short biography of hiram revels will help to explode the myth that reconstruction negro congressmen were not educated and well trained hiram rhoades revels was bom september at fayetteville n c he was born of free parents so he never knew the condition of servitude he left north carolina when a young man revels moved to indiana and attended the quaker seminary in union county a while later he moved to darke county ohio and attended the seminary there when he had completed this period of education he went to baltimore he was ordained in the african methodist episcopal ministry in his education was incomplete he went to illinois and graduated from knox college at bloomington after completing his education the young negro taught and lectured to his people in indiana illinois missouri kansas kentucky and tennessee at last he settled in st louis where he taught for a short while later the energetic young minister returned to preaching in cincinnati st louis pittsburgh and baltimore preacher revels was in baltimore when the civil war began he assisted in organizing the first two negro regiments raised in maryland in revels moved to st louis and founded a large school for freemen the first founded by a negro he helped to recruit a negro regiment in st louis in he went to mississippi and joined the federal army as chaplain of a negro regiment at the same time he helped the freedmens bureau to extend protection to negro troops chaplain revels crossed over from vicksburg to jackson to establish schools and churches bushwhackers almost captured him but he was warned by friends and managed to escape in he left the army and went to louisville and then to leavenworth kansas to preach in revels settled at natchez mississippi where he combined preaching with participation in politics the first republican convention ever held in mississippi met at jackson september about a third of its members were exslaves revels had been elected as alderman of natchez in he was elected to the state senate in at this time revels had received no particular attention from the reconstruction republicans but when the state legislature of mississippi convened in january preacher revels was called on to open the session with a prayer his prayer was impressive and did much to lead to his election as united states senator the minister had entered politics reluctantly because he feared his participation would cause racial friction he was careful to never prostitute the pulpit to partisan purposes as some were accused of doing mississippi had no representative in the united states senate after jefferson davis resigned at the beginning of the civil war when mississippi reentered the union in revels was elected as a compromise candidate the memphis daily avalanche of january had this to say about the first negro to serve in the united states senate seven cities contended for the honor of homers birth how many will struggle for revels is yet a question a week ago people had never heard his name or if heard it was only to be forgotten now it will be the subject of leaders and when revels reaches washington the reporters of all the great journals will interview him happy revels he is of popular manners and speaks with great ease in his intercourse with all classes he conducts himself with decorousness that has won him the regard of all his neighbors at home and of the members of the mississippi senate of which he is now a member revels did not go to washington to serve a full fouryear term it was an unexpired term to last from february to march blanche kelso bruce was the first negro to serve a full term as united states senator when senator revels arrived in washington some members of the mississippi delegation held a party president u s grant and his cabinet members were present grant received revels with much kindness and told him he hoped he would be admitted in the senate without difficulty it was reported that even the radicals of the republican party didnt want a negro in congress when revels credentials were presented to the senate on february one senator james nye rejoiced in a speech that a negro was replacing jefferson davis this set off a debate that lasted all day and revels was not confirmed on that daythe debate resumed on february and lasted all day without a decision senator simon cameron made a speech in which he reminded the senate of what he had said in when jefferson davis left washington see earlier reference the radicals wanted to seat revels in davis old seat for the spectacular effect it would create senator ross of kansas the man who broke the tie vote to impeach andrew johnson as recorded in john f kennedys profiles in courage occupied jefferson davis old seat no he would not give it up and revels was forced to take no on the opposite side of the row a vote of to was cast in his favor on february and revels became the first negro to be seated in the united states senate the newspapers and the negro ministers in washington announced that senator revels would give his first speech in the senate on march the gallery of the senate was packed a writer for the philadelphia press said never since the birth of the republic has such an audience been assembled under one single roof it embraces the greatest and the least american citizens the occasion of revels speech was the readmission of georgia into the union in referring to his race revels managed to get in a word for civil liberties they appeal to you and to me to see that they receive that protection which alone will enable them to pursue their daily avocations and enjoy the liberties of citizenship on the same footing with their white neighbors and friends sir i repeat the fact that the colored race saved the noble women of new england and the middle states many men of whom they lean today for security and safety many of my race representatives of these men on the battlefield sleep in countless graves of the south if those quiet resting places of our honored dead could speak today what a mighty voice like to the rushing of a mighty wind would come up from those sepulchral homes could we resist the eloquent pleadings of their appeal ah sir i think that this question of immediate and ample protection for the loyal people of georgia would lose its technicalities and we would cease to hesitate in our provisions for their instant relief senator revels didnt receive any more attention until the summer of at this time he appointed a negro to west point the negro cadet who faced intense harassment failed to pass and was soon dropped the nation of june pronounced it a very foolish and cruel thing as far as the boy and his family were concerned and a very injudicious thing as far as the colored race is concerned the first negro senator introduced two or three minor bills which failed to pass on february revels gave his last speech in the senate it concerned the mixed schools in the district of columbia which he favored at the conclusion of his speech he said the white race has no better friend than i i am true to my own race but at the same time i would not have anything done which would harm the white race senator revels term came to a close on march he did not run for reelection alcorn college for negroes was established in mississippi and revels became its first president he was appointed by governor alcorn who had replaced him on the states senate in june revels went to new orleans to edit the southwestern advocate an organ of the general conference of his church revels then served a second term as president of alcorn college after this he returned to religious work and made his home at holly springs mississippi he became district superintendent of his church and died while attending a church conference at aberdeen mississippi the date was january thus ended the career of the first negro to serve in the united states senate the year was the year that george h white a negro native of north carolina went out of office white was the last negro to serve in congress until so the year will be the terminal point in this paper extensive coverage of the career of hiram r revels is given to set the stage for comment on other negroes to serve in the united states congress we are now familiar with the conditions of the times which vary little with the other united states senator blanche kelso bruce and the or so negro congressmen from to however their personalities and pronouncements were often at variance with revels as we shall see as already stated revels was bom free and served only part of a term march blanche kelso bruce only negro to serve full term in united states senate born a slave at prince edward county virginia as a passing comment what if they had closed their schools in the s instead of in the s they would have lost a united states senator from their county even though he removed to mississippi before he became senator the charge that all negro officers were illiterates ignorant of the science of government cannot be sustained some of them had undergone considerable training and had experienced sufficient mental development to be able to discharge their duties with honor b k bruce was educated at oberlin college this was quite an accomplishment in itself for an exslave allan nevins in writing about reconstruction gives the white mans view of negroes in politics thus the north had gone far beyond the step of merely granting the negro a full participation in the rights and duties of free society it had taken the millions of former slaves almost uni versally unlettered and ignorant the children of the dark continent and the victims of slavery and had placed them in charge of the delicate and complicated mechanism of modern democracy with power to deal with its laws and its courts the men most capable of government the able experienced and welleducated whites whom the south had been wont in prewar days to place in office were rigidly excluded from public affairs i would hope that the great historian allan nevins has grown in his insight of southern white politicians of antebellum days and the reconstruction negro politicians since he wrote the above in the career of blanche k bruce who may have been exceptional will go a little ways in refuting the judgment of professor nevins a couple of quotes from leading historians at the conclusion of this paper should also help to refute the quote of nevins blanche k bruce was the only negro in american history to serve a regular term in the united states senate edward brooke of massachusetts will be number two he was born a slave in prince edward county virginia march his mother had been the slave of a wealthy planter and young bruce was a pet and often said he saw none of the horrors of slavery instead he did as he liked and was educated by a tutor bruce escaped to hannibal missouri there he organized the first school in the country exclusively for negroes after the war he took a special two year course at oberlin college at this point he had more education than andrew jackson andrew johnson and harry truman then he went to mississippi at just the opportune time since there was a good chance there for intelligent and capable men he also found time to engage in planting on a large scale and became wealthy these honors made bruce much more logical a candidate than revels had been he was elected against very weak opposition securing even the votes of three democratic senators bruce was present march when the special session met and he received more attention than anyone except andrew johnson who had just returned to the senate on account of a grudge against ames alcorn the white senator of mississippi did not escort his colleague to the desk to be sworn in bruce was embarrassed but was starting up alone when senator conkling noticed it and accompanied him for this bruce was duly grateful and several years later named his only son roscoe conkling bruce had the courage to vote against the wishes of his white colleagues in the senate when he thought something was wrong in their thinking the majority of the senate in was in favor of the bill to exclude orientals senator bruce came to his feet with the following speech mr president i desire to submit a single remark representing as i do a people who y but a few years ago were considered essentially disqualified from enjoying the privileges and immunities of american citizenship and who have since been so successfully introduced into the body politic and having large confidence in the strength and assimilative power of our institutions i shall vote against the pending bill i dont see many white southern politicians speaking up for democracy in that way at the time may bruce had the unusual experience of presiding over the democratic senate for some time in bruces last session he continued on his same committees but did little else only a few bills were introduced by him and none passed one proposing to buy the freedmans bank property did pass the senate but got no further as his only success he was granted the discarded senate furniture for the use of the home for colored women and children from to the time period of this paper there were only two negro senators so i have been able to give considerable space to their careers to illustrate the type of negro who was serving in the senate however during this time there were negroes who served in the house of representatives therefore i will not use the space to give the careers of all the representatives since hiram r revels a native of north carolina was the first negro to serve in the congress and george h white a native of north carolina was the last negro to serve in the congress during the period of this paper i will go into the career of white to illustrate the type of negro who was serving in the house george white was elected to congress at a time when the south was doing her utmost to disfranchise the negro by this time white served from to even the republican party had turned its back on the negro if reconstruction left its mark on white america it also affected jk black americas political life and means of earning a living reconstruction made the negro a republican as has been noted in the words of frederick douglass the republican party was the deck and all else was the sea a goodly number of negroes became democrats but they had to bear the reproaches of their fellow negroes and sometime even the contempt of whites of their own party just before the turn of the century the nation turned a deaf ear to the negro when the south went into an allout drive to return to precivil war white supremacy president mckinley made no public pronouncement on the big race riot at wilmington n c where negroes were being prevented from voting north carolina passed a constitutional amendment which disfranchised negroes and once again mckinley remained silent dr rayford w logan writes it is appropriate that the last negro congressman of the postreconstruction era completed his term at the end of mckinleys first administration two negroes had been members of the house and one of the senate five had been members of the house and seven from to there had been two negro congressmen in each session from to three and from that time to only one the last of these george h white of north carolina had been elected during the fusionist campaign of and was returned in the election of despite the white supremacy campaignwhich even josephus daniels was to regret in his old age representative george white was among the better negro orators and he was not afraid to speak his mind it is worth noting some things he said in congress in on the day following washingtons birthday he white asked should not a nation be just to all her citizens protect them alike in all their rights on every foot of her soilin a word show herself capable of governing all within her domain before she undertakes to exercise sovereign authority over those of a foreign land should not charity begin at home white was referring to acquisition of territories and peoples after the spanishamerican war of congressman white in one of his best speeches made a fullscale sally upon the breastwords of mob law and lynching we have struggled on as best we could with the odds against us at every turn our constitutional rights have been trodden under foot fully of my race have been ignominously murdered by mobs not percent of whom have been made to answer for their crimes in the courts of justice and even here in the nations capitalin the senate and housesenators and representatives have undertaken the unholy task of extenuating and excusing these foul deeds and in some instances they have gone so far as to justify them the white supremacy people of the south and also many of their white brothers of the north had been used to negroes being seen at the back door and not heard one of the reasons the negro had been accused of being an ignorant and uneducated legislator was not so much his ignorance but the fact that he had not been allowed to speak out so whites statements made the southern white raging mad on february he white quoted on the floor of the house a diatribe in josephus daniels raleigh news and observer one typical sentence read it is bad enough that north carolina should have the only nigger congressman on march both houses of the north carolina legislature noted with speeches of thanksgiving that whites term in the united states congress had ended white had realized that enough negroes had been disfranchised in north carolina and white supremacy had gained strong enough foothold that his reelection would be futile he did not put himself up for reelection when george h white of north carolina the last of the postcivil war congressmen finished his term in he predicted in a moving valedictory that the negro would return his phophecy was fulfilled when oscar de priest of chicago was elected in to the first of three terms samuel d smith author of the negro in congress who rarely found negro members worthy of commendation paid white a mild tribute when he said that the valedictory would have been an excellent one had the note of bitterness not been so strong always in whites estimation the white race was wrong and the negro the innocent victim the speech was a better one than smith was willing to concede in view of the plight of the negro at that time it was relatively restrained in his conclusion white made a prediction that has today been fulfilled the thesis in this paper has been that negro congressmen were most times worthy and fully qualified for their positions so for a conclusion i will quote some reliable people on how they saw the negro congressmen their responsible conduct moved james g blaine their contemporary to observe the colored men who took their seats in both senate and house did not appear ignorant or helpless they were as a rule studious earnest ambitious men whose public conduct would be honorable to any race the africans who came to the united states as slaves started can heritage soon after they arrived in this country they were searching for the lost identity that the slave system has destroyed concurrent with the black mans search for an identity in america has been his search for an identity in the world which means in essence his identity as a human being with a history before and after slavery that can command respect some afroamericans gave up the search and accepted the distorted image of themselves that had been created by their oppressors as early as dr edward wilmot blyden the great west indian scholar and benefactor of west africa addressed himself to this situation when he said in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary school books geographies travels histories having embraced or at least assented to those falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes despite the alienation spoken of here by dr blyden the afroamericans spiritual trek back to africa continued dr w e b du bois the elder statesman among the afroamericans addressed himself to the broader aspects of this situation on the occasion of the celebration of the second anniversary of the asianafrican bandung conference and the rebirth of ghana on april when he said from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries the africans imported to america regarded themselves as temporary settlers destined to return eventually to africa their increasing revolts against the slave system which culminated in the eighteenth century showed a feeling of close kinship to the motherland and even well into the nineteenth century they called their organizations african as witness the african unions of new york and newport and the african churches of philadelphia and new york in the west indies and south america there was even closer indication of feelings of kinship with africa and the east the planters excuse for slavery was advertised as conversion of africa to christianity but soon american slavery appeared based on the huge profits of the sugar empire and the cotton kingdom as plans were laid for the expansion of the slave system the slaves themselves sought freedom by increasing revolt which culminated in the th century in haiti they won autonomy in the united states they fled from the slave states in f t the south to the free states in the north and to canada t here the free negroes helped form the abolition movement and when that seemed to be failing the negroes began to plan for migration to africa haiti and south america civil war and emancipation intervened and american negroes looked forward to becoming free and equal citizens here with no thought of return to africa or of kinship with the worlds darker peoples however the rise of the negro was hindered by disfranchisement lynching and caste legislation there was some recurrence of the back to africa idea and increased sympathy for darker folk who suffered the same sort of caste restrictions as american negroes during the eighteenth century there was strong agitation among certain groups of black people in america for a return to africa this agitation was found mainly among groups of free negroes because of the uncertainty of their position as freedmen in a slaveholding society one can see it late into the eighteenth century dr du bois explains in his book dust of dawn when the negro union of newport rhode island in proposed to the free african society of philadelphia a general exodus to africa on the part of at least free negroes the back to africa idea has been a reoccuring theme in afroamerican life and thought for more than a hundred years this thought was strong during the formative years of the colonization society and succeeded in convincing some of the most outstanding black men of the eighteenth and nineteenth century such as john russwurm the first negro college graduate bowdoin and lott carey the powerful virginia preacher later the society fell into severe disrepute after an argument with the abolitionists two freedom struggles emerged early in the nineteenth century one african one afroamerican while the africans were engaged in their wars against colonialism the american blacks were engaged in slave revolts some slaves took the christian version of the bible seriously and believed that god meant all men to be free such a slave was gabriel prosser of virginia who felt that he was inspired by god to lead his people to freedom over slaves were involved in his revolt of before it was betrayed in in charleston s c a carpenter denmark vesey planned one of the most extensive revolts against slavery ever recorded he too was betrayed and afterwards put to death along with of his followers in the greatest slave revolt of all occurred in virginia led by nat turner a plowman and a preacher whose father had escaped to freedom in joseph cinque the son of a mendi king in sierra leone west africa was sold into slavery and shipped to cuba cinque and his fellow africans revolted on board the ship and ordered the ships owners to sail to africa the spanish owners of the ship steered northward when they were not being watched and eventually landed off the coast of long island the africans were arrested and sent to new haven conn where they were put on trial when the trial began there was great excitement in the country people talked about the case and took sides southern politicians wanted to give the africans back to the spaniards who had bought them the trial lasted all winter in court cinque made a wonderful speech in his own language telling the story of how he and his men had fought to be free after that speech the court ordered the africans set free cinque and his men were sent to school to be educated and were found to be intelligent and quick to learn meanwhile the two spaniards and the spanish government appealed to the united states supreme court to have the africans returned to them as slaves the friends of cinque and his men asked john quincy adams the former president of the united states and a great lawyer to speak for the africans on march j after adams had spoken chief justice taney of the supreme court ruled that cinque and the others were to be freed after that cinque continued his schooling and in he and his men returned to africa all america had been stirred by this case the slave owners feared that the news about the freedom and return to africa of cinque and his fellow africans would cause their slaves to revolt and also demand to be returned to their homeland in the years before the civil war plans for the migration of the free negroes back to africa were revived and agents were sent to south america haiti and africa paul cuffe a free black ship owner from new bedford massachusetts had founded the friendly society for the emigration of free negroes from america and had taken a large number back to africa at his own expense in the middle of the nineteenth century while the issue of slavery was being debated in most of the country the feeling for africa among american blacks was growing stronger publications like freedoms journal and douglass monthly edited by frederick douglass called attention to the plight of the people of africa as well as the black americans i thank god for making me a man simply but delaney always thanks him for making him a black man this spoke frederick douglass of his old friend martin r delaney spokesman physician explorer and scientist martin r delaney was proud of his african background and the mandingo blood that flowed in his veins he was one of the leaders of the great debate following the passage of the fugitive slave act in he was the spokesman for the black people who felt that the bitter racial climate in america had made life for them in this country unbearable delaney was the strongest voice in several conventions of free neuroes to discuss plans for emigrating to africa in he led the first and only exploratory party of americanborn africans to the land of their forefathers in the region of the niger river in the area that became nigeria delaneys party carried out scientific studies and made agreements with several african kings for the settlement of emigrants from america this interest in africa was continued under the leadership of men like rev alexander crummell and bishop henry mcneal turner during the latter part of the nineteenth century edward wilmot blyden a native of what was then the danish west indies called attention to the important role that africa could play in emerging world affairs he was convinced that the only way to bring respect and dignity to his people was by building progressive new empires in africa he was of the opinion that the new world negro has a great future in africa he saw liberia in west africa as the ideal place where africanamericans could build a new and great civilization by making use of the things that they had learned in the west and preserving the best of the african way of life because of his j and the work of many others the african consciousness was translated into useful programs of service to africa afroamerican institutions of higher learning joined in this service through their training of the personnel of the churches as well as their support of africans studying in their institutions the idea of uniting all africa had its greatest development early in this century in a west indian lawyer h sylvester williams called together the first panafrican conference in london this meeting attracted attention and put the word panafrican in the dictionaries for the first time the delegates to the conference came mainly from england the west indies and the united states the small delegation from the united states was led by w e b du bois this meeting had no deep roots in africa itself and the movement and the idea died for a generation then came the first world war at the close of this war w e b du bois led the determined agitation for the rights of african people throughout the world particularly in africa meetings were held and a petition was sent to president wilson who was meeting with other leaders of the western world at the peace congress in versailles dr du bois went to paris with the idea of calling a panafrican congress for the purpose of im pressing upon the members of the peace congress setting in versailles the importance of africa in the future world in spite of being without credentials and influence some attention was paid to the idea president wilsons assistant colonel house was sympathetic but noncommittal the chicago tribune said january in dispatch from paris dated december an ethiopian utopia to be fashioned out of the german colonies is the latest dream of leaders of the negro race who are here at the invitation of the united states government as part of the extensive entourage of the american peace delegation robert r moton successor of the late booker t washington as head of tuskegee institute and dr william e b du bois editor of the crisis are promoting a panafrican conference to be held here during the winter while the peace conference is on full blast it is to embrace negro leaders from america abyssinia liberia haiti and the french and british colonies and other parts of the black world its object is to get out of the peace conference an effort to modernize the dark continent and in the world reconstruction to provide international machinery looking toward the civilization of the african natives the negro leaders are not agreed upon any definite plan but dr du bois has mapped out a scheme which he has presented in the form of memorandum to president wilson it is quite utopian and it has less than a chinamans chance of getting anywhere in the peace conference but it is nevertheless interesting as selfdetermination is one of the words to conjure with in paris nowadays the negro leaders are seeking to have it applied if possible in a measure to their race in africa dr du bois dream is that the peace conference could form an internationalized africa to have as its basis the former german colonies with their square miles and population to this his plan reads could be added by negotiation the square miles and inhabitants of portuguese africa it is not impossible that belgium could be persuaded to add to such a state the square miles and natives of the congo making an international africa with over square miles of land and over people this africa for the africans could be under the guidance of international organization the governing international commission should represent not simply governments but modem culture science commerce social reform and religious philanthropy it must represent not simply the white world but the civilized negro world with these two principles the practical policies to be followed out in the government of the new states should involve a thorough and complete system of modern education built upon the present government religion and customary law of the churches within ten years black children ought to be in school within a generation young africa should know the essential outlines of modern culture from the beginning the actual general government should use both coloured and white officials w e b du bois wrote extensively about the idea of panafricanism and the world unity of people of african descent this is the essence of his statement on the intent of the panafrican congress of this congress represented africa partially of the delegates from fifteen countries nine were african countries with delegates the other delegates came from the united states which sent and the west indies with most of these delegates did not come to france for this meeting but happened to be residing there mainly for reasons connected with the war america and all the colonial powers refused to issue special visas the congress influenced the peace conference the new york evening globe february nd described it as the first assembly of the kind in history and has for its object the drafting of an appeal to the peace conference to give the negro race of africa a chance to develop unhindered by other races seated at long green tables in the council room today were negroes in the trim uniform of american army officers other american coloured men in frock coats or business suits polished french negroes who hold public office senegalese who sit in the french chamber of deputies the congress specifically asked that the german colonies be turned over to an international organization instead of being handled by the various colonial powers out of this idea came the mandates commission the resolution of the congress said in part a that the allied and associated powers establish a code of law for the international protection of the natives of africa similar to the proposed international code for labor b that the league of nations establish a permanent bureau charged with the special duty of overseeing the application of these laws to the political social and economic welfare of the natives c the negroes of the world demand that hereafter the natives of africa and the peoples of african descent be governed according to the following principles the land and its natural resources shall be held in trust for the natives and at all times they shall have effective ownership of as much land as they can profitably develop capital the investment of capital and granting of concessions shall be so regulated as to prevent the exploitation of the natives and the exhaustion of the natural wealth of the country concessions shall always be limited in time and subject to state control the growing social needs of the natives must be regarded and the profits taxed for social and material benefit of the natives labor slavery and corporal punishment shall be abolished and forced labor except in punishment for crime and the general conditions of labor shall be prescribed and regulated by the state education it shall be the right of every native child to learn to read and write his own language and the language of the trustee nation at public expense and to be given technical instruction in some branch of industry the state shall also educate as large a number of natives as possible in higher technical and cultural training and maintain a corps of native teachers the state the natives of africa must have the right to participate in the government as far as their development permits in conformity with the principle that the government exists for the natives and not the natives for the government they shall at once be allowed to participate in local and tribal government according to ancient usage and this participation shall gradually extend as education and experience proceeds to the higher offices of state to the end that in time africa be ruled by consent of the africans whenever it is proven that african natives are not receiving just treatment at the hands of any state or that any state deliberately excludes its civilized citizens or subjects of negro descent from its body politic and cultural it shall be the duty of the league of nations to bring the matter to the civilized world the idea of panafrica having thus been established dr du bois now attempted to build a real organization the panafrica movement began to represent growth and development soon the du bois approach to panafricanism was challenged by the approach of marcus garvey the national association for the advancement of colored people began its interest in africa with support of the various panafrican congresses called by dr du bois the african and afroamerican freedom struggle that had met and joined forces briefly in the nineteenth century was now meeting again in the twentieth century two great personalities were bringing the message of africas awakening to the worlds attention both of them were saying in different ways that africa was great once and will be great again both of them told the afroamericans that they had a part to play in africas redemption the two personalities were w e b dubois and marcus garvey the italianethiopian war renewed interest in africa this interest sustained and was increased when in the gold coast gained its independence and took back its ancient nameghana black american grassroots identification with african problems burst upon the international scene during the first congo crisis when a group of black nationalists created a disturbance in the galleries of the united nations in protest against alleged u n connivance in the murder of patrice lumumba this identification with african political affairs amongst the black masses reached its zenith with the visit to africa by malcolm_x shortly before his death and his effort to enlist the support of the organization of african unity this growing interest in africa and a rediscovery of the lost african heritage launched the spread of black consciousness among young civil_rights militants out of this feeling the concept of black_power was bom he tend to read history t os not our ey es ut tv r with our prejudices so y said wendell phillips more than a century ago in his eulogy on toussaint louverture the black liberator of haiti phillips did not live to see the day of unprejudiced history for he died in when carter g woodson had not yet reached his teens but thanks to woodson who in began to resurrect the negro past succeeding generations of americans would increasingly begin to read history with their eyes the result is that today we are witnessing somewhat of a boom in negro history a boom which shows no signs of abating the movement grows apace to make our countrys history less white and more american today as never before there is a mounting realization that not all colored folks were picking cotton in the southland before or after appomattox in the words of herbert hill this increasing interest in the historical negro embraces all manner of menthe scholar in his study the teacher in the classroom the parent in the home and the negro masses who have come to have a new image of themselves the larger general public has not been immune to this revitalized study of the negro past to the idea that the negro has been a mover and shaker in our history if negro history is here to stay one of the reasons is the behavior of the presentday negro the current civil_rights revolution has brought with it a heightened interest in the negros role in the american past within the negro community itself there has been a growing pride in the negro heritage a sentiment shared alike by the rank and file and the talented tenth of w e b du bois negroes who are no longer ashamed of their skin color or hair texture are not likely to be ashamed of their past proud acceptance of ones self makes for proud acceptance of ones past reflecting this spirit some civil_rights groups have brought out brief negro histories realizing the importance of supplying the missing pages from the agenda of the past negro history looms large in the portfolio of the freedom movement indeed a basic premise of the freedom schools was that our nations history was by no means the creation of whites only another grassroots effort that may be noted is the establishing of negro history museums often under the leadership of writers artists or teachers negro parent groups have been active particularly in urging school boards to bestir themselves these parents have called for a better portrayal of the negro in the history textbooks and in other teaching materials in some instances this effort has been supported by farseeing white parents who wish to bring their children up without prejudice and who realize that prejudice feeds upon ignorance and distorted information school boards in our big cities seem to have got the message they have scrutinized history textbooks more carefully making sure that the negro is seen in proper perspective some school systems have revised their course outlines in the social studies to include negrorelated materials in new york city the board of education has set up a human relations unit designed to promote better schoolcommunity feeling one of the units most helpful publications has been a page mimeographed pamphlet on the negro in american history a number of other school systems likewise have prepared special negro history booklets and guides some city systems have set up negro history workshops designed for social studies teachers primarily but open to others that the nature of american history is changing is recognized by the testing services that construct examinations for entrance into college and for job placement increasingly the examinations constructed by these agencies will have essay and multiple choice questions relating to the negro predictably the first negroes to appear in these tests may be nonmilitants like phillis wheatley and george washington carver but inevitably frederick douglass harriet tubman and w e b du bois will appear and who knows one day malcolm_x and the black_power dissidents may even make their appearance in higher education it is to be noted that some colleges and graduate schools are for the first time scheduling courses in negro history a number of other such institutions are seeking fulltime professors of african history and negro american history the world of business has become aware of negro history last spring the wall street journal carried a frontpagearticle entitled the black past written by a staff reporter peter h prugh its opening lines ran like this the list of titles published by the book companies reflects this increase of interest in the negro and for the childrens market we may expect negro history coloring books possibly bearing the title color me colored for children too a negro history game of the old maid type has made its appearance in this game there are picture cards consisting of pairs of pictures of such worthies as crispus attucks prince hall and john b russwurm there is a single card labeled uncle tom de picting an oldster with a hangdog expression and the player who winds up with this card loses the game big business firms have sensed that negro history is good public relations one firm for example has brought out for free distribution a travelers guide to negro history another firm has brought out a booklet about notable negro women of the past and still another has produced a negro history cartoon book negro history has been found of use to our countrys policymakers the national advisory commission on civil disorders as it began its hearings in september devoted an entire afternoon to an examination of the negros past in america men in political life are coming to realize the importance of knowing something about the historical negro no politician it has been said can win a major office in america without first getting right with lincoln but humor aside candidates for public office in our major cities may find it important to have at least a bowing acquaintance with a few negro heroes past as well as present especially those of local derivation a major and final reason for the promising future of negro history is that it has attracted the attention of the world of scholarship historians can perform no service more useful to society writes j g randall than to expose faulty or vicious generalizations about history that continue to mislead mankind and historians have come to realize that one of the aspects of history about which people have been badly informed up to now has been the role of the negro for the historians are finding him in whatever phase of the american past they choose to focus upon be it exploration war government invention culture or sports the depth of the negros involvement in our history is suggested in earle e thorpes observation slight the negro in studies or theories on southern history and the truth is always missed another presentday historian wesley frank craven in his the legend of the founding fathers expresses the same thought in the form of a question who among us can wander down the streets of williamsburg with promptings on every side to remember washington and jefferson and still remember that it all rested originally upon the back of a negro in history circles the current stress on urban history will certainly bring the negro more to the fore scholars are now paying much more attention than ever before to the rise of cities in america and their profound impact on our national life in such studies it will hardly be possible to bypass the negro who since the turn of the century has become increasingly an urban dweller a proportion rising from onequarter in to threequarters today in addition to including the negro in general portrayals of city life writers of history have been turning out books in which the urban negro is the central character such works include richard wades study of slavery in the cities of the south gilbert osofskys description of harlem from to and allen h spears treatment of black chicago covering much the same period from the pages of these writers we are learning that many of the problems faced by the urban negro stemmed from his role as a newcomer hence to view the urban negro as a man seeking to make an adjustment in a new environment would seem to be a sounder explanation of his experience than to view him as some have done as the product of a broken unstable family or as having some other deeply ingrained folk pattern peculiar to americans of color another phase of the past that is undergoing significant historical revision is the history of africa before columbus the ancestral homelands of the negro american are now undergoing historical redefinition making use of newer nontraditional techniques researchers are providing more and more information on early africa and when the dark continent is seen in its true light the history of the west coast peoples who were transplanted to the new world the afroamericans will likewise be illumined the upsurge of scholarly interest in negro american history is clearly revealed by the number of articles now being written about it the number of scholars who read papers at the recent annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history is but a portion of those who had expressed a willingness to appear the number of learned papers being produced far outruns the publication capacity of the journal of negro history plus the other negroedited quarterlies phylon and the journal of negro education happily the other learned periodicals are publishing negro articles more and more one of the hurdles facing the researcher in negro history is a lack of readily accessible information happily here too there are signs of change the ford foundation for example has established a civil_rights documentation project whose aim is to collect information on the civil_rights movement of our times this body of data including oral history and unpublished material will be made available to future researchers the chairman of the ford committee is ralphe j bunche its members include margaret mead and john hope franklin and its director is vincent j browne another significant project designed to aid scholars is the editing of the voluminous papers of booker t washington this undertaking is headed by louis r harlan under the sponsorship of the university of maryland and launched by an initial grant from the national endowment for the humanities in time the scholarly study of the negro should profit from the relatively new warren center for the study of the history of liberty in america located at harvard the center is headed by oscar handlin author of firebell in the night a work bearing the explanatory subtitle the crisis in civil_rights the work of the historical guild is worth noting because its output is likely to be based upon the best knowledge available at the time the professionallyminded historian is wedded to the idea that truth is the whole he seeks better history better often because more inclusive inevitably this better history will reflect the viewpoint that the negro has been a protagonist of significant historical action time out of mind and this fact the true historian would not wish to ignore for in his search for the significant past he welcomes such a fresh element of vitality his vision thus enlarged the historian may then with due modesty proceed to fashion his small footnote to the vast repository of the written word black resistance in colonial haiti haiti was called st domingue when it was a french colony from about to the s when the slaves revolted abolished slavery and wrested their independence st domingue was frances most valuable colony france became wealthy and powerful by engaging in the slave trade and by shipping processing and selling on the european market the sugar coffee and other products produced by the slaves of st domingue the haitian revolution led by toussaint louverture was the only successful slave revolt in history and the first successful independence movement in latin america governments like to give the impression that they are allpowerful the policy makers know better there arent enough police there arent enough soldiers to control a people which does not recognize the authority of the government and organizes effectively against it this is true in south vietnam today it was true in colonial haiti governments must mystify their subjects with symbols of authority with brainwashing religions and with bribes and threats to keep the people divided the people must largely accept the values of the government or there can be no real stability force alone is never enough french control in st domingue was always weak because the slaves created their own institutions for coping with slavery the official documents of the french colonial administration tell us something about the avenues of freedom which the slaves managed to open up even under slavery the market was very important to the economic social and religious life of west africa and the slaves skilled in buying and selling controlled the internal market of the colony the french colonists depended upon the slaveoperated markets to trade goods within the colony especially to provide the cities and towns with food the market was held on sundays and holidays and the noise interfered with religious services but the colonial authorities had to recognize that the colony depended upon these slaveoperated markets the famous code noir black code of outlawed the slaveoperated markets but the french colonists protested that they were absolutely necessary to the commerce of the colony and the french government changed the law the next year and allowed the slaveoperated markets to continue the code noir of denied all property rights to slaves article said the west african brought with him his own ideas about property which were not as clearcut as those of the french in dahomey which had the greatest cultural influence in haiti everything belonged in theory to the king land horses implements slaves money even the person of the subject but no king would dare claim his rights out of fear of the ancestors there were two other types of property one was the property of the sib or the extended family it was owned collectively and administered by the oldest male member of the sib the other was private property which could be held by men or women it included houses built trees planted regardless on whose land money earned produce of labor utensils guns mats pipes and magic charms consisting often of herbs and medicines discovered by hunters in the forest who then could sell the formula to others there were complex rules for inheritance of personal property the slaves never accepted the french ideas about property and used their control of the internal market to buy freedom for themselves and their fellow slaves from the french point of view it was wholesale theft and dealing on the black market and they passed many laws to try to curb these operations they required slaves to have a written permit from their masters authorizing them to sell certain things anyone buying goods from a slave without a permit from his master was subject to fine imprisonment and even corporal punishment slaves were forbidden to sell sugar cane even with the masters permission it was hard to enforce pass laws because most of the french colonists were illiterate the colonial administration could never control the black market some of the documents describe how it operated one document complains that the slaves were stealing indigo and other merchandise which was easy to carry and selling to black market operators traveling from plantation to plantation and this trade was thriving so much that the public markets were poorly attended another document describes the operations of the black market another way for the slaves to get money was monopoly price fixing especially of food sold in the cities and towns another document complains that there were was motivated by the desire for freedom and they tried to control the black market by forbidding masters to free their slaves in return for money explaining why emancipation without government consent were being outlawed they said most of the disorders that occur in the french islands among the slaves come from the facility which the colonists have of giving them freedom in return for sums of money which they agree upon with their said slaves some even abandon the service of their masters engaging in private affairs under the pretext of working by the day in return for a small recompense which they promise to their said masters others abandon themselves to all kinds of vices to amass the sums agreed upon getting together and carrying on their commerce in the houses of those who have already been freed most of them having cabarets even among whites who are low enough to receive them day and night traffic with them and suffer their infamous and immodest commerce and this is very common in spite of the ordonnances and the prohibitions already made published and posted but this did not help and laws continued to be passed throughout the colonial period to try to control theft and the black market flight was an even more effective means of organized resistance the slaves ran away to the spanish part of the island where they were safe and to colonies of runaway slaves called marons up in the mountains they built towns cultivated the soil raided the plantations and defended themselves from assault by the french they sent messengers to the plantations to encourage other slaves to escape the french authorities knew that the marons were a serious threat to french rule emilien petit a member of the conseils superieurs des colonies wrote in a colony which has the misfortune to have to fear establishments of slave deserters enters from that moment into a state of war the danger of which can only increase with time documents show that in spite of the brutal penalties passed for flight the french could not control the situation in march we read the island finding itself devastated by fugitive slaves the council orders that we negotiate with francisque slave of mr fabulet and leader of a large band the conditions of this treaty are that francisque will have his freedom and a thousand pounds of tobacco and that no punishment be inflicted upon the members of his band from there is a large number of fugitive slaves who have committed several disorders and violences taking cattle stealing food crops and kidnapping even people passing along the highways and we have learned that these negroes live in common in the woods where they have plantations under cultivation houses built and food planted rewards were offered for the capture of fugitive slaves mutilation of he leg and even death become penalties for flight raiding parties were organized against the maron colonies in we read that the divers raid which we have ordered against the marons negroes have not had the success that was expected and larger detachments are ordered into the field masters are told that slaves found off their property without a pass will be shot on sight but the fugitive slave colonies continued to grow and prosper in we hear the following complaint escaped slaves have a way of getting together in the woods and living there exempt from service to their masters under leaders whom they elect among themselves others hiding themselves in the canefields during the day await the night to rob passersby on the highways and go from plantation to plantation taking cattle which they find to eat or hide themselves in the cabins of their comrades who ordinarily participate in their thefts knowing what goes on in their masters house and advising the said fugitive slaves so that they can take their measures for the said thefts without being noticed by we hear of mass desertions the number of slaves who have become marons for the past few years and especially during the war is excessive because of their libertinage they leave in bands and desert to the foreigners with whom we were at war so that several of the colonists have had the misfortune of seeing themselves deprived of the cultivation of their lands and reduced to seeking the help of their friends to provide for their families and it is certain that in none of the neighborhoods the enemy has not taken so many as those who have given themselves of voluntarily and that a great number who remain do so only for the return of some and the desertion of others from the island in a militia is organized to cope with the disorders of the maron negroes which increase every day in the neighborhood of cap and cause great prejudice by the establishments they make in the mountains obliging us to search all means to destroy them and procure to the colonists tranquility in their work and security in their neighborhoods m m m r in the marechausee a permanent body of troops to fight the marons was first organized the reason the negro slaves desert every day with arms and horses and everything they can steal from their masters or from other colonists and even join together in large numbers to be in condition to defend themselves if anyone attempts to stop them and it has already happened several times that thus assembled or alone armed or unarmed they leave from all over the island and go to the spaniards where they are perfectly well received and from where it is impossible to get them back and the news of this favorable reception from the spaniards has spread among the rest either through spanish agents or by means of the negroes themselves sent back to foment desertion this reception has made in their minds an impression which tends towards a general revolt and by consequence the total ruin of the colonists of cap and even the loss of the entire colony in their desperation the administrators became more savage the heads of negroes shot were to be exposed upon pikes any colonist could shoot and kill any negro who he met at night who refuses to stop when first commanded to do so masters were to keep all arms and munitions under lock and key spaniards entering the colony were warned not to speak to nor have any kind of business with any slave under penalty of being thrown into jail at once prices were put on the heads of certain leaders of fugitive slaves in a price was put on the head of a slave named noel who has assembled a considerable number of slaves around him notably several foremen of different slave gangs and he has succeeded in so frightening the colored people that they no longer dare present themselves before him the colonial authorities committed mass tortures and executions in public to terrorize the slaves there are many examples this is only one it is a judgment against slaves men and women blacks and mulattoes hand cut off before the church drawn and quartered by four horses this done their members thrown into the fire and their ashes into the wind and their heads exposed on pikes planted across from the cabaret where the assassination was committed the said accused first to be subjected to interrogation under ordinary and extraordinary torture the executioner was a slave who had been condemned to death and was offered his life in return for being what was euphemistically called the executioner des hautes oeuvres the executioner of exalted works moreau de stmery said that several slaves when offered this choice preferred death the executioner was not very popular and upon at least one occasion the population got its revenge a document dating from tells us that on the occasion of the execution of the sentence of death against d the condemned escaped and the executioner was murdered in the town square by the outraged crowd and in its impotent rage the authorities forbade all persons of whatever quality or condition they may be to interfere with the executions of justice by excesses violences and emotions directly or indirectly under penalty of being pursued extraordinarily but they never found a culprit to pin the blame on all over the americas slaveholding nations tried to detach the slaves from their tribal gods they outlawed certain dances the beating of drums slave priests and herb doctors the possession of fetishes music at funerals and sometimes even marriage and funeral ceremonies in the spanish colonies where the slave population was relatively thin conversion to catholicism and education in that faith was considered the best way of controlling the slaves the french tried that in st domingue but it didnt work the slaves selected what they wanted from catholicism but continued to use their tribal gods to subvert the social order melville herskovits said in africa the conquest of one people by another meant the mutual interchange of acceptance of the respective deities the conquerors added to their own pantheons the gods of those whom they had conquered so that these forces might not wreak a supernatural vengeance upon them while to the conquered the power of the gods of those who had defeated them was selfevident this willingness to accept other gods indicates a flexibility which the french did not possess in other respects as well the west african tradition gave the slaves extraordinary psychological strength dahomean myths stress astuteness in the face of great power maintaining a sense of humor not judging by appearances realism in all relationships discretion in speech resiliency in social situations taking steps to meet problems forseen the west african is not a fatalist herskovits said neither gods nor men are pawns in an allordering system where individuals are endowed with supernatural powers they derive these from spiritual helpers who respond when they are called on but the individual is not moved like a marionette by these powers the slaves of st domingue were to use a current cliche highly motivated and sometimes the french came to believe in the occult powers of their slaves some masters believing that their slaves were sorcerers burned them alive or killed them by breaking their bones with clubs or hammers we quote a judgment against colas jambes coupees legless colas known for his maronages to the spanish seducing and carrying off other slaves leader of an armed band highway robber in broad daylight as well as at night attacking even whites having several intelligences and secret correspondences to abolish the colonies instigator or accomplice in the gangs of cezar jupiter louis and cheri all of whom were punished with extreme torture and death accused furthermore of sorcery and magic for having a number of times escaped from irons and prisons and having poisoned several negroes and since all his crimes and his life are known all over the area and by everyone in the most minute detail the judgment calls for his prompt torture and execution before he escapes again drugs herbs and poisons were used on a grand scale by the slaves who knew more about these matters than did the authorities emilien petit suggested that slaves be given their freedom who have denounced and procured the discovery of unknown poisons and made possible the arrest and punishment of the authors promoters and accomplices of these unknown poisonings because of the loss of a great number of whites slaves and cattle dead of poisoning before one had often before one could have discovered the manner or the authors of these crimes and because of the danger of communicating this secret from one area to another the most widespread conspiracy using poison as its major weapon was the one masterminded by macandal who was burned alive by the authorities in the judgment against him convicted him of rendering himself feared among the negroes and corrupting and seducing them through his prestige and inducing them to commit impieties and profanations to which he delivered himself as well in mixing sacred things in the composition and use of packets pretended to be magic and tending towards evil deeds which he made and sold to negroes and having furthermore composed sold and distributed all types of poisons they were especially shocked because macandal used incense holy water and small crucifixes as well as herbes and poisons in the fetishes he sold after the macandal conspiracy the french colonists seemed to have lost all enthusiasm for converting the slaves to catholicism they passed the following law all colonists are forbidden to allow the superstitutious assemblies and ceremonies which certain slaves are accustomed to hold at the death of one among them and which they improperly call prayers all freedmen and slaves are forbidden to compose sell distribute or buy fetishes or macandals so fearful did the colonists become of assemblies of slaves that the use of christian churches by them was severely restricted in spite of the protests of the jesuit missionaries claiming that the temples of god have become the temporary refuge of fugitive slaves and serve often as a theatre of prostitution the authorities ordered all churches closed to slaves after sundown and between noon and pm no religious offices even minor ones could be held by slaves to protect the security of the colony no slave free black or mulatto could preach either in towns or in the countryside the slaves of st domingue resisted fiercely because it was a matter of life or death they had to be lucky to survive conditions in the slavetrading ships and pens they had to be even luckier to survive conditions on the plantations especially on the sugar plantations during the grinding season which lasted seven or eight months out of the year the slaves were driven day and night with only a few hours to sleep they were so overworked that pere labat an expert on how to run a sugar plantation advised planters to keep a long sharp knife near the canegrinding machines to cut off the arms of slaves who fell asleep and got their fingers caught in the grinders since the machines could not be stopped in time and the slave would be pulled through the grinders only his head falling off slaves should be forced to sing to stay awake so they would not fall into the boiling cauldrons of syrup the slaves were always hungry and neglected when they were sick because the planters believed it was more profitable to work a slave to death and then buy a new one instead of going to the expense of giving him food rest and medical attention the average working life of a slave was seven years french slave law held that a master could punish his slave only by giving him up to blows with a switch or a rope but there is one case of a master who murdered over of his slaves some by what was called total mutilation the master was fined and allowed to keep the rest of his slaves masters tortured and burned alive their slaves suspected of being poisoners forcing them to reveal the names of their accomplices real or imaginary who were in turn tortured and burned alive the slaves were faced with cold calculated conscienceless exploitation and an early grave a fate not very different from that of black youth in our ghettoes today only the form is different no one sees no one knows but death is the great dissolver of irrelevancies the slaves of st domingue were able to resist effectively and finally win their freedom when the right moment came because they never accepted the values of the white colonists and because the black underworld played a largely protective role towards the black community it exploited the white community for the benefit of the black in the united states today it works the other way around the black underworld exploits the black community for the benefit of the white underworld maybe because the black underworld is too attached to the symbols of success and worthiness held by the white world to use its extraordinary talents for the benefit of the black community if you have not read the novel the confessions of nat turner random house by william styron before you do i suggest you read thomas greys confessions of nat turner in which nat turner a negro slave describes in schizophrenic eloquence how he and a few other slaves massacred whites in an abortive attempt to rid this country of slavery now with the rhythm of nats own account reverberating in your head try to guess answers to this question what really was behind this mans thinking or what made this coon behave so badly after all we did for him if you guess that he had an extremely liberal master who like frankenstein created a monster by educating him and whose family treated him like one of them that his revolutionary drive is traceable back to his sexual fantasies about the great white woman which he mistook for the divine spirit that he was a priggish pampered and wellfed houseboy who loathed field niggers then your guesses coincide with what mr styron believes went on inside nat turner in the name of fiction mr styron can do whatever he likes with history when his interpretation however duplicates what is white americas favorite fantasy ie every black maleespecially the leaderis motivated by a latent desire to sleep with the great white woman he is obligated to explain in the structure of the novel of course this coincidental duplicationor to be criticized accordingly since there is no such explanation in the technique of the novel and since it offers no vision or new perspective but rather reaffirms an old stale shameful fantasy which is still quite saleable it is at best a good commercial novel and mr styron is certain to get movie rights out of it it has been said and i think it is true that ones enjoyment of the novel will depend in part on his view of civil_rights the book does have a strange kind of contemporaneity about it it is not for example nat turners repressed obsession for the white woman margaret whitehead that is so appallingly familar but styrons own compulsive persistence in believing that this really is nats obsession thus the novel is not so much about a black slave in a white world as it is about a contemporary white novelist engulfed in a black one it is not so much about the existential predicament of a condemned man as styron declares in the new york times oct as it is about styrons own attempt to explain to himself the origin and destiny of the black world he sees around him every single day and in this sense the mind of the man before us is not nat turners but william styrons someone who has not experienced or felt a thing has to have it explained to him in this i think is the key to this novel and its author as emotional inheritors to slavery few negroes need an explanation of what it was like there are some people who are not so fortunate mr styron for example tells us oct the new york times how for many years he was haunted by the subject of slavery read also his essay this quiet dust harper april after a number years of reading everything he could find on the subject mr styron could explain slavery to himself and to anybody who needed an explanation but he was not finished until he had created a character who could explain it all back to him his version of nat consequently is that of an extraordinarily logical explainer this version of nat turner as a rational sensitive houseboy makes it difficult to believe he could have pulled off such a gutsy revolt and styrons decision to put the story entirely in the mouth of his hero is a structural error since we never know who is doing the talking nat or styron until the contemporary cliches force us to decide in favor of styron rational sensitive and with a good grip on the american class scheme styrons nat finds the field niggers disdainful and avoids them whenever possible in using the outhouse for example he avoided the morning rush training my bowels to obey a later call when i can enjoy some privacy why is it necessary for a major white american novelist to insist upon creating a nat turner who avoids his own people could it be that styron is trying to make his character plausible and for whom white middle class america maybe in stressing the logical rational side of nat styron ignored the emotional irrational schizophrenic charismatic powers of a man who for all who knew him was a witch doctor magician shaman and prophet these powers relate nat directly to the tribal preliterate society of africa in which the leader had to prove by extraordinary feats and prophetic visions that he was indeed possessed of the sacred mana no doubt this tradition tempered nats version of christianity he was not as styron invents the grandson but the first born of a spirited african girl who was literally just off the boat in order to be known to native blacks as a witchehman one had to possess at birth both physical peculiarities like a whopplejaw a harelip crooked or bowed legs one eye like fire and the other eye dead and uncommon intelligence in his actual confession recorded at the time of his trial nat says that he was thought by his father and mother to be intended for some great purpose because of certain marks on my head and breast and of his unnatural mental peculiarity he relates this incident when three or four years old i was telling them children with whom he was playing something which my mother overhearing said it had happened before i was borni stuck by my story however and related some things which went in her opinion to confirm itothers being called on were greatly astonished knowing that these things had happened and caused them to say in my hearing i surely would be a prophet nat convinced many others of his charismatic powers but he seemed to have been his own greatest believer this selfadmiration is best noted in his description of how he learned to read the manner in which i learned to read and write not only had great influence on my mind as i acquired it with the most perfect ease so much so that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet but to the astonishment of the family one day when a book was shown me to keep me from crying i began spelling the names of different objectsthis was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood particularly the blacks unlike john browns histrionics at his own trial nats confessions represent the real man throughout his confessions nat contemplates himself simultaneously as subject and object this schizophrenic view of oneself seems to be the natural results of a black man having to make do in a white world as leroi jones expresses it the negro could not ever become white and that was his strength at some point always he could not participate in the dominant tenor of the white mans culture yet he came to understand that culture as well as the white man it was at this juncture that he had to make use of other resources whether african subcultural or hermetic and it was this boundary this nomansland that provided the logic and beauty of his music styrons nat turner lives not in nomansland where actually he did live and black people are still living but in mr styrons white america where a white woman and a book are so symbolic of what poor nat thinks he needs that he fevers with insupportable excitement that i can feel a loosening in by bowels really although it gives more insight into turners apocalyptic disturbed and irrational mind than any single part of styrons novel nats own account of his education quoted above styron ignores when nat in the actual confession talked of his education he was really talking about himself his feelings his grandiose ideas etc but when styron comes to describe nats education he abandons nats account of his education for his own invented version he seems to suggest that nat revolted against the slavery of his people because of his education and not because of his sense of humanity provoked by identification with that group styron therefore replaces nats account of his education with what reads like a scene from up from slavery a la mode walt disney burning with the desire to be educated this little black boy spends his free time in his masters cellar learning the labels on barrels of sugar saltpeter etc then one day he gets up a lot of nerve and steals a book quite a noble fellow he is caught but instead of being punished he is assured by his liberal master that he will certainly learn to read after all styron says part of his intent was not to shirk what must have been after all the tolerable aspects of the situation ie slavery styrons nat turner is also a victim of his creators theories of revolutionary heroes in an interview styron said nat like most revolutionaries was basically puritanical and this is the reason that in the book he nat turner never had a sexual experience directly with a woman he has an adolescent homosexual experience quite innocent beyond that turner lived a sexual life of fantasy fantasies of women mainly white women which in turn led to imagined revelations and then finally to what turner supposed were revelations from the divine spirit new york times oct can we account for a caesar an alexander martin luther mao jefferson there is no real distinction between a born leader and a revolutionary leader it all depends on what side you are on by this theory and if not why foist it off on nat it is my guess that nat turners revolt cannot be explained by a theory it can only be felt possibly through art styrons book is too fettered by contemporary cliches to approach art he cannot begin to use his emotions because he has paralyzed them with his fantastic analytical ability to explain everything styron denies of course contemporary parallels in the book the central meaning of the book is not consciously contemporary because he began the book and was concerned with the subject back in the fortiesas though the negro problem just moved on the scene in the last years if a novel has new information the overshadowing of the artistic and aesthetic intents by the contemporary parallels may be justified but styron has nothing new to say what he says has been said over and over and believed by far too many in his views on the negro he only differs from the infamous enemy of the negro movement the liberal in using history as a buttress for his ideas styrons nat finally is a super conformist not only does he adopt white mannerisms and parrots their linguistic rhythms but if the truth be told he wishes he were white and the reviewer who said styrons nat turner was negro only in physical aspect is right styrons nat is telling the reader constantly that he is just like any other american yet only middle class america is convinced that any black man least of all a nat turner is an american like anybody else on this point leroi jones has said the negro as he exists in america now and has always existed in this place certainly after formal slavery is a natural nonconformist being black in a society where such a state is an extreme liability is the most extreme form of nonconformity available the vantage point of being both outside and inside at the same time connects the black writer with america in a way the white writer can never be connected to his country in the writings of w e b du bois e franklin frazier james weldon johnson richard wright james baldwin ralph ellison and leroi jones we have proof of this william faulkner was very wise in believing he could never imagine himself as a negro this is not to suggest that mr styron tried to be a negro and failed what i am saying is that there is the dark side of nat turner which mr styron never shows us he shows us not a black nat but a white nat at best a colored one in a white worldcecil m brown the pitman publishing corporation e th street new york n y has come up with an attractive and highly informative addition to the growing body of literature on the black mans role in american historv in eyewitness the negro in american history by william l katz the publishers offer a big book vhxvi inches pages full of fascinating and often unfamiliar facts and illustrated handsomely and with profusion the books contents are divided into fourteen sections beginning with the opening of new worlds and ending with americas civil_rights revolution plus a preface by mr katz and an index the nononsense tone of the book is set in the very first sentences to wit for all who came to these shores america was a land of freedom hope and opportunity for allexcept the negro he came in chains and for hundreds of years had to fight just to be free mr katz method which is used in another important book published a few months ago is to let history speak for itselfthrough the words and the actions of those who were present ator participants inthe historical events the african slave trade for example is described by george w carleton in the suppressed book about slavery which was published in such obscure black patriots and adventurers as salem poor and james armistead heroes of the american revolution are brought up front and some fresh light is cast on the close relationship between black men and red men in the territory of florida when that semitropical area was in the possession of spain there are rundowns on the familiar black explorers and inventorsjames beckwourth george bush benjamin bannekerand cameos on less well known innovators such as norbert rillieux of new orleans who in revolutionized the sugar refining industry in europe and america with his invention of an evaporating pan eyewitness is not without its intentional ironic humor one of the fabulous pieces in the book is a reprint of a learned paper by a perfectly respectable medical doctor at the university of louisiana who in held forth in a most scholarly manner on two diseases indigenous to black men the diseasesdrapetomania or the disease causing negroes to run away from slavery and dysaethesia aethiopica which overseers called simply rascality and which it turned out was the blacks habit of unintentionally through stupidity and clumsiness of course breaking and destroying valuable property belonging to the slaveholders the book is rich in documentation examples of which space does not permit more listing mr katz indicates in his preface that he has been in the process one way or other of producing his book since his high school days its comprehensiveness speaks of such tenacity and concern he now teaches american history at woodlands high school in hartsdale n y and is a member of the westchester county curriculum committee the westchester county people are fortunatehwf all right to begin with it is expensivebut it is also very rare and even more special there has never been anything quite like it made available to the general bookbuying public and it very possibly will never be made available again in this edition what is itit is ethiopian painting a collection of color reproductions and photographs of the art of ancient abyssinia from the late middle ages and during the gondar dynasty arranged by jules leroy and published by frederick a praeger in his preface to this grand volume m leroy points out that ethiopia is usually conspicuously absent from histories of art both general histories and those which are concerned specifically with african works of art any reference that does occur is very limited and bears no relation to the actual significance of the subject he says the book sets out to indicate just how significant ethiopian art has been particularly in the area of coptic christian representations the story of ethiopian painting is closely allied to that of the countrys political and religious development the author states it mirrors ethiopias various links with the outside world and the influences which these contacts have had upon her cultural development it is m leroys bias to explain ethiopias glories and her unique culture almost wholly in the light of the countrys christian history but that can easily be overlooked in reading and absorbing the capsule report on the ethiopian past which m leroy provides certainly many of the paintings shown in the book are close in style and technique to those of a contemporary period in europe but the most fascinating specimens are those stamped with that special flavor which is neither european nor african nor even suggestive of the familiar art of neighboring egypt but oriental some are strongly reminiscent of ancient chinese tapestries but it has to be accepted that they nevertheless are distinctly ethiopian m leroys text is solid intensive and instructive and it would be useful as an essay on ethiopian art and history even without the elaborate illustrations which incidentally must have been set on the pages by hand there are keys to the various plates indicating their location whether in churches or ecclesiastical buildings in ethiopia or in museums in ethiopia or in other countries and there are captions to the plates which provide a rather comprehensive rundown on the background and historical significance of the art works there also are bibliographical notes which under the circumstances the first encyclopedic references to ethiopian art were entered around the turn of the century reveal a paucity of research in this area furthermore nearly all the research material is in french german and italian and there is a general index the book was printed in italy by fantoni artegrafica venezia apparently it was first published in milan in and the english translation is by claire pace whatever the case ethiopian painting is a singular book a proud specimen for those concerned with african art and history the costat is indeed quite high but great care and artistry joy adamson is well known in naturalist and moviegoing circles as the white britisher who wrote so persuasively of her relationship with the lioness elsa there were three or four of the elsa books and a film based on them and elsa has as a consequence been established as one of the more gracious heroines of all animalhood mrs adamson has now tried her hand with a book on humans in the land of elsa kenya by name the book is the peoples of kenya harcourt brace world and it is a big book well suited for children of all ages if not of all outlooks which is not to say that it is not a remarkable book for it is even more remarkable than apparent when one realizes that nearly all the photographs and entirely all the paintings reproduced in this lavishly illustrated book are the work of mrs adamson mrs adamson set out to record on canvas the flora of kenya but she became so fascinated with its fauna human and otherwise that she decided to put some of them on canvas too the kenya government presumably under the british commissioned her to do so after she had undertaken the work on her own initiative and at her own expense the emphasis is on the various peoples of kenya as much as possible in their native state that is in the areas as removed as possible from the influences of encroachingwesternization in this mrs adamson and her book have performed a most useful service she deals knowledgeably with the different tribes of kenya and with their customs and clothing the pages are crammed with valuable information humanized by mrs adamsons uncomplicated personalized narrative style there is an epilogue written in a more sophisticated if also more technical style by g w b huntingford an anthropologist excellent features of the book are the index and the elaborate map of kenya and neighboring countries on the inside covers of the book which locates the major tribal and ethnic groups discussed in the book there also are helpful explanatory notes and a glossary of abbreviations plus a bibliography the reader will not find in the peoples of kenya any photographs of the modern metropolis of nairobi nor any reference to the fact that kenya is the most industrialized of the newly independent countries in east africa but that is the subject of some other book hwf the dance through the ages madison square press by walter sorell is one of those big handsome profusely illustrated books which appear every autumn just in case someone is thinking of the holidays and the gift problem and the dance through the ages it should be said directly will make a splendid gift for the dance buff holiday or not the text is comprehensive mr sorell begins with a consideration of primitive dancing elaborating his simple thesis that dancing is a medium of mans selfassertion an outlet for surplus energy a supreme means of expression the succeeding chapters of the plus page book ranges through such diversions as the rules of ritual folklore and theater the triumph of romanticism pioneers of modern dance martha graham graces the cover and after diaghilev there are chapters on the dances of the east the renaissance man and cancanization and there are chapters on the mass media and the dance dealing with the movies the stage musicals and television and recording the dance of very special interest to negro digest readers of course is the chapter on jazz and the negro dance which mr sorell has handled with perception and knowledge some of the most beautiful of many extraordinary photos in the book are shots of alvin ailey and his dancers against a black backdrop the dance in africa of course also is considered in the opening chapter of the book the dance through the ages is rich in illustration both photos and drawings and both color and black and white walter sorell teaches the history of the dance and theater and dramatic literature at columbia university and at the new school for social research in new york city he also is a contributing editor to dance magazinehwf i there have been many books about south africa but ernest coles house of bondage random house gains extra force with its expressive photographs which bring before our eyes the conditions which mr cole with thomas flaherty describes in the text after seeing photographs of a starving baby a schoolteacher exhausted after a day in an overcrowded schoolroom and ragged streetboys huddled in a park one gets a deeper feeling of the land and of the conditions the people have to endure ernest cole had to pose as a pilgrim to lourdes to escape from south africa with his photographs previously when he had been questioned by the police about them he had to pretend that he was working on a story about juvenile delinquency to prevent the police from confiscating them the photographs are excellent they range from striking portraits to action shots of tsotsis from zoot suit picking the pocket of an afrikaaner and mugging another to mood shots of the loneliness of the exiles village of frenchdale there is an introduction by joseph lelyveld who met mr cole while he was new york times correspondent in south africa in the text which precedes each section of photographs mr cole describes various aspects of south africa the mines transportation the police the locations servants apartheid bantu education hospitals religion streetboys and tsotsis shebeens and beer halls the middle class banishment education now has become education for servitude in the stricter apartheid today the state in its haste sometimes tears down the old locations to remove the blacks before it has built new towns for them and consequently they have to live in tents the best jobs are reserved for whites outside of a few doctors and awyers to serve the blacks the best that an african can hope for is to be a servant or messenger the result of this blocking of advancement is the streetboys and the adult tsotsis who live by crime and robbery since they are used to violence if there is a confrontation between whites and blacks the tsotsis would be the spearhead of violence since the middle class cannot advance they measure their status by the difference between themselves and those who are poorer or less educated they pathetically treasure tea or dinner with liberal whites and scorn to serve on committees with someone who may be a servant thus their potential leadership is often lost both the text and the photographs make conditions in south africa vivid to us but the pictures add extra values of emotion interest and aesthetics which make it a desirable purchasedudley randall at bull street denmark vesey stood in r front of his mirror carefully knotting his cravat he spent a few seconds searching his beard for gray hairs then he slipped into his coat set his hat squarely on his head and picked up his bible and a package wrapped in brown paper from the top of his dresser he gazed thoughtfully at the package and then dropped it in his pocket after one last glance at his short dark frame in the mirror he went out the back door and down the dirt path toward his buggy where peter poyas waited squatting beside the horses as he crossed the yard he heard the cannon at fort moultrie booming across the charleston harbor shaking the city out of its sunday afternoon lethargy he watched the cannon smoke billow up into the still carolina sky and catch the last copper streaks of sunlight as the sun like a huge ball of fire slipped down behind the ashley river sending long shadows creeping up the narrow twisted streets over wooden fences across wide flowered yards and into the cool frame houses of the town the horses stirred rattling their harnesses as denmark approached the buggy and peter poyas rose shifting his shoulders in his stiff sunday coat his great neck straining against his shirt collar i still dont see why you have to go through with this denmark he said handing denmark the reins if everything goes right it wont be long fore you haveem with you anyways denmark took the reins and stepped up into the buggy i got to make one more try peterjust one more try but you done tried a lotta

your temper you hear ill watch it ill watch it see you tonight after church peter nodded and slapped the flank of the near horse and the buggy whirred down the lane alongside the house two deep lines creased his brow as he stood gazing at denmarks erect back then he followed lane out onto bull street wagons and buggies filled mostly with negroes dressed in their sunday finery rolled softly up and down the street as the people passed peter poyas their faces brightened evening peter evening hidee peter coming to the services tonight on my way there now sister on my way now peter started across the street where ned and rolla bennett waited in one of their masters wagons ned sat rooted in the high front seat like a black buddha patiently flicking the reins at the flies buzzing around the mules beside him slouched rolla his long legs jutting out over the wagon his eyes wandering over the passing girls while his hands caressed the polished back of the guitar that rested in his lap when peter reached the wagon rolla quickly stood up moved behind the front seat leaned over the side and helped peter into the wagon ned clucked at the mules and they lumbered east towards kings road a carriage driven by a large black man glided past them fluttering with reds and greens and blues worn by a mulatto woman and three brown girls the driver smiled and waved his hand peter and ned smiled and waved rolla grunted there goes that ol jim pencill mista god amighty hisself just cause he free he thinks he bettern the rest of us niggers sheeit he wont even let his daughters dance with us ned

sure they reached kings road and turned north on it they crossed calhoun street and ned urged the mules on to escape the sharp odors of the stock pens as they rolled past the old citadel rolla peered into the shadows surrounding the high gloomy walls he shivered remembering the tales of ghosts and torture and blood and rape and cocked his head to catch some whisper from the stillness they passed into open country and the darkness closed in fast the june night was clear and starless a pale yellow moon sneaked up behind their backs and glided along the tops of the trees that hustled in the shadows alongside the road from a close by pond frogs bassed out their songs nearer crickets clicked out their mes sages up ahead they saw the lights of the african methodist episcopal church glowing in the darkness ned stuck his pipe in his mouth for one last smoke peter shifted his shoulders in his tight coat rolla stood up swaying in the middle of the wagon and began to tune his guitar hey mista peter rolla said aint ol jim pencill supposed to preach tonight uh huh well i sure hope he dont stand up there and talk all night so well have some time left for singing and dancing id druther hear mista denmark preach anytime i reckin we aint gonna have no time for singing or dancing tonight peter said i think wed better get back to denmarks house right after the preaching im a little worried about him new glanced quickly at peter and said why whats the mater peter said denmarks took it in his head again to try to buy bell and benji free from ol mista faulkner and you know as well as i do how its gonna come out yeah ned said nodding slowly he twisted around in his seat and looked at rolla i dont wanna have to come looking for you rolla and find you gallivantin out in the woods you be at the wagon right after preaching you hear the buggy reeled down the moonfilled road and still denmark cracked the reins across the backs of the drumming horses a moan slipped out of his lips and was snatched away by the wind his head whirled his ears roared suddenly he felt his stomach heaving and he hauled back on the reins before the horses had stopped he leaped from the buggy and stumbled into a grove of pine trees at the edge of the road vomit spewed from his mouth and nose a spasm shook him his knees buckled and as he fell face forward into his own waste the sharp scent of pine and cedar rose in waves around him slowly he regained consciousness he struggled to his knees and looked around down the road he saw his horses and buggy standing quietly in the moonlight above him he heard an owl hoot and flutter its wings he crawled to a tree and leaned his back against it as his head cleared what had happened back at the faulkner house flooded back into his mind and a scream surged out of his chest cutting through the tall trees and shattering the still night when he wheeled his buggy into the faulkner driveway he had seen bell standing in the doorway of her cabin which lay behind and to the right of the rambling unpainted main house he knew that she had been watching for him and he smiled and threw up his hand he saw her shift in the doorway and place one hand on her hip shes all of fifty he thought and still as fine a looking woman as ever ill be down directly he called aloud i gotta see mista faulkner first he saw her nod and sink down in the doorway behind her in the dim light of the cabin he thought he caught a glimpse of benji and he smiled again he drove around to the back of the main house whoaed the horses and climbed down from the buggy he patted the brown package in his coat pocket clutched his bible under his arm and marched up to the back door as he rapped on the door peters voice flitted through his mind now you remember you aint got no right to go stirring up things the door swung open and conroy faulkners tall wide body filled the yellow block of light denmark said evening mista faulkner i came to visit bell and benji but first id like to talk a little business with you come on in denmark faulkner said i been meaning to talk to you too come on in he retreated into the room dragged a chair from under the kitchen table and sat down crossing his legs at the ankles tufts of reddish hair streaked with gray peeped from under his widebrimmed hat that shadowed the upper part of his face the galluses of his breeches flapped down and his massive chest was bare and pale against the red brown of his neck and lower arms he clasped his hands over his stomach now ringed with fat and looked up at denmark who had followed him into the room denmark he said ive knowed you for a long timeever since i bought bell and ive alius gave you leeway to see her even more so after you got benji by her aint that right yessir and thats what i want to see you about what im saying is that i cant have you coming to see bell and the boy no more you ruining the boy just today i had to i whatre you talking about denmark took a step forward look i got three thousand dollars and ill give it all to you straight out for bell and the boy he drew the brown package from his coat pocket and thrust it in faulkners face three thousand dollars and you wont have to worry about seeing me around here no more faulkner let his eyes slide away from the money cant you get it through your head that bell and benji aint for sale they mine and i dont want you round here no more you ruining the boy you but mista faulkner didnt you promise me years ago and each year after that that i could buy bell and benji now didnt you faulkner lowered his chin on his chest and said softly yeah i did but things was different then my wife was living and conroy junior was still at home but i aint gonna sell bell and the boy to you now his voice dropped lower they all i got and you gonna have to stay away coming round here filling the boys head with all kinds of stuff youyou even got bell acting like she dont belong to me denmark felt the anger rising in him and the shame he pressed his bible tighter under his arm trying to still the tremors running through his body he had thought that he had grown accustomed to the shame that unique humiliation that swept over him each time he had to obtain faulkners permission to visit bell and benji but now it struck him like a hammer thoughts that he had suppressed for years rose to the surface of his mind this was not just a matter of his trying to buy two slaves but of two men wanting the same woman had peter known is that why he had said aint no amount of money gonna matter is that why faulkner had made excuses year after year suddenly he realized that he was not at all sure of bell didnt he after all have other women and children and had he failed year after year to buy her freedom he felt his heart pounding again peters words flashed across his mind you aint got no right but he spun on his heels stepped to the door and jerked it open his voice shoving the light spilling out into the dark yard bell you come up here right now you come up here and you bring the boy listen nigger whats got into you no nigger can come on my property cause you free you still a nigger denmark turned from the door and approached faulkner again holding out the money to him he saw faulkner glance at the money three thousand dollars mista faulkner he said with this money you can move into town and be near mista conroy junior denmark paused wondering why he was all at once a little concerned for this man then he continued and i tell you what ill fix up a small place for you therereal cheap aint i one of the best carpenters in town what do you want to stay out here for anyhow the lands wore out youre going deeper and deeper into debt every year he heard bell enter the room but he kept his eyes on faulkner who still sat with his chin on his chest the anger in him that had died down momentarily flared again now that bell was here hed show this man what was what what i cant understand mista faulkner is why you wont sell bell and benji free now bell already knows that you promised faulkner jerked up his head nigger you shut up then he saw bell and his voice dropped ive said all im gonna say denmark now you get off my property denmark looked at bell she stood quietly just inside the door her hands folded across her shift her wide eyes darting from him to faulkner her bottom lip caught between her teeth he held her eyes and said but mista faulkner all im trying to do is buy two nigger slaves for three thousand dollars now why would you a white man refuse to sell two niggers for three times what theyre worth faulkner shoved up from the chair his face livid denmark turned facing him and he could see that he was plunging past the danger point but even as peters warning was beating through his brain words were tumbling out of his mouth bells my woman mista faulkner she might be your slave but shes my woman keeping his eyes locked with faulkners he stretched out his hand toward bell and said come here bell come over here he saw faulkners mouth open and then clamp shut the silence seemed like twenty years he noticed a vein throbbing in faulkners temple and felt his own heart pounding in his throat at the edge of his vision he saw bell pressed against the wall beside the door again he motioned with his outstretched hand and said come on over here bell he saw her sway almost imperceptibly in his direction and his heart sang his happiness died before it was born he saw faulkners eyes darting around the room and the blood draining from his face you aint got no right to go stirring up things not right now just for your woman and boy he had to stop bell he tried to run his tongue over his dry lip and he felt his face cracking as he forced himself to grin he couldnt risk everything just to satisfy himself dont look like shes gonna come mista faulkner he said must be hard of hearing aint worth no three thousand dollars nohow he saw the tenseness disappear from faulkners body well nigger im glad you came to your senses for awhile i thought i was gonna have to he knows im lying denmark thought but he cant do nothing aloud he said hell aint no old nigger woman worth that much bother faulkner was conciliatory you gonna have to git it through your head denmark that you a nigger even though you free the next time wont be no next time mista faulkner denmark grinned he knows im lying denmark thought but he wont do anything about it because then hes admitting to bell and to hisself that she is a woman to him and not just a slave but what is bell thinking he looked at her she wouldnt meet his eyes her shoulders seemed to droop he clenched his bible and screamed silently you awful lucky i like you denmark you a good hard working nigger most of the time but i cant have you round bell and the boy no more his tone changed now you git on home and consider yourself lucky yessir mista faulkner denmark grinned i sure will he felt the room swaying but he kept the smile on his face he looked again at bell her eyes were still on the floor his bell of over twenty years bell with the strong thighs and tender hands bell who nodded and understood even urged him when he alone bought his freedom and left her with only promises you aint got no right to go stirring up things i got to get out of here he thought i got to get out of here he began to move backwards toward the door the grin still pasted on his face and the next time i catch you on my property ill put the law on you or shoot you and you stay away from that boy you the cause i had to whip him today anyhow that boy got to learn denmark thought i got to get out of here before i kill him right now before i kill him right now before i kill him right now still moving backwards he stumbled out of the back door dropping his bible and as he regained his footing he saw benji standing in the darkness silently his eyes glowing like two moons had he heard benji he took a step toward him but benji shrinked along the wall and slipped through the doorway benji benji the loner the swift who ran all day through the woods and fields who wasnt yet broken to the harness the promises he started for the door you aint got no right not right now he stopped the air rushed out of his lungs perspiration stung his eyes he saw the block of light in the doorway waver and begin to spin and he turned and fled he scrambled into the buggy and fumbled for the reins as he wheeled his buggy around he spotted his bible the pages fluttering laying in the path of light streaming out into the yard he slapped the reins across the horses backs sending them bolting down the driveway now he staggered to his feet made his way out of the grove of pines to the road and headed for his horses and buggy that still stood quietly in the moonlight down the road pulling his handkerchief from his pocket he began to wipe the vomit from his clothes his body still shook and his knees were weak he paused to catch his breath then started again ill wait no longer he said aloud ill die if i wait any longer the sound of his own voice stilled his trembling and strengthened his legs he the prayer ended jim pencill rose from his knees and stepped up to the pulpit as the congregation shuffled and scraped and settled back on the benches he thumbed the pages of his bible finding his place he held it with his finger and looked out over the sea of black faces brothers and sisters he said tonight im going to take my text from the book of exodus the twentysecond twentythird and twentyfourth verses he looked down at his finger and read haltingly and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up to god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them jim pencill paused to let his words sink in then he laced his fingers together rested his elbows on his bible and said brothers and sisters i want you to pay real close attention to these holy verses and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt diedin the process of time rolla shifted in his seat he crossed and uncrossed his legs folded and unfolded his arms then he glanced down the bench at ned and peter ned sat with his eyes closed his hands folded across his stomach rolla didnt see neds lips move at all and barely heard the angry murmur i dont aim to die a slave in the process of time and after hearing their cries and moans god had respect for the children of israelrespect because they kept his commandments even while in bondage rolla saw peters composed face slowly turn toward him and their eyes met catching the tiny light in peters eyes he smothered the smile forming in his lips he wasnt sure if the flash had been of laughter or of anger then his eyes dropped to peters lap and when he saw the clenched fists he knew and in time god delivered the children of israel out of their bondage in the process of time god rolla crossed his legs again his guitar in his lap and let his eyes roam over the crowd of black faces hoping to catch the eye of some pretty girl mron karenga is a spokesman highly endowed not only with the power to rap in a manner black but with a cois severely systematic this means it is possible to read a succession of declarations on art for instance that require no more space than three pages and gain at the same time a definitive introduction to his thought his powers of compression are no less remarkable and are eloquently spoken for by the fact that the entire text which is entitled the quotable karenga and which covers at least seven major areas requires no more than thirty pages also due to close philosophical kinship to both malcolm_x and to leroi jones his remarks help to clarify by their wealth of implications far more than his own distinctive position that position being black cultural nationalism nationalism be it black or white must by its very nature conceive of revolution as a public rather than a personal event as a result individualism is one of its primary objects of attack and diversity one of its first casualties this initial attack is prompted by a sincere desire for unity and reasonably enough public minded movements have never been content to pursue unity without also seeking to control the people they would unify therefore no one should be surprised that karengas opening remark on art is a simple declaration of social control over it black art must be for the people by the people and from the people that is to say it must be functional collective and committing this is a very important premise for the last three words are used at a later point to explain what art must be in order to be revolutionary in addition we learn that all art is the reflection of the values of the people this is understood in such a way as to allow karenga to dismiss individuality and the concept of art for arts sake now this dismissal of these two concepts is partly explained by a general concern for what might be continued from page called renegade brothers those who reach for what is thought to be above the heads and interests of the general black public sometimes this reaching out and beyond is hasty careless and in a certain sense selfdestructive because of the bland unexamined values that often support it and karenga like malcolm and jones has a number of penetrating things to say about mixedup values but it should be admitted that part of this singular striving is also due to honest dissent to bringing ones own values and attitudes not to mention those of ones community ones black community into serious question but more significantly it is the effort to go ones own way to follow ones personal bent ones individual path there is a very subtle link between the question of individuality and the notion of art for its own sake it is taken for granted that there is a relationship between the two what that relationship is however is another matter it is usually reduced to subjectivism which is scandalous enough to those critics who insist on defining everything in social terms charges of artificiality and decadence are also popular objections with regard to the nature of art karengas two key words are collective and functional and he is being very shrewd in making them so the first term has to do with origin art is seen as the product of the people all art should be the product of a creative need and desire in terms of black people and again all art reflects the value system from which it comes it should be noted that function and origin are related especially when the purpose is said to derive from the needs of a people black people of course in this case any artist who believes this does considerable violence to his calling and it would be a very serious matter were it not for the miraculous wonderinspiring resilience of art to which the much abused notion of art for arts sake is a very stubborn witness this notion declares nothing less than the selfdetermination and the selfsufficiency of art it is one way of confronting us with the powerful suggestion that what makes us alive and what makes us artists is one and the same force it is another way of saying that art makes the artist rather than the other way around it does so by allowing him to tap his own inner resources and one consideration that should be kept in as steady a focus as possible is the meaning of individuality for there is no better way of calling attention to the irrelevance of bringing up the issue of subjectivity and collectivity more popularly called objectivity individuality means wholeness the sort of indivisibility one associates with the classic notion of an atom collective and subjective refer to the relative point from which reality is to be viewed individuality on the other hand is concerned with reality itself and not with the position from which we may view it it is a level and an order of reality beyond which one simply cannot go like a real atom it can not be reduced any further it is a matter of foundation and anchorage and art itself furnishes the artist with a self a new self just as a guitar or a piano grants new fingers it makes one conscious of a true and sobering individuality and its initial work its initial relationship to the artist reveals itself to be a most rigorous severe exacting sweeping and delightful as well as thoroughgoing system of a truly radical reorientation both for the artist and for us the audience ray charles not only sings the blues he is also the product of the blues that is to say he is the product the extoller the champion the creation of his own art form and his music which is also our music without the necessity of regimenting him allows for a number of things it allows him to be a man it does so by allowing him to be a real individual this it does by not only allowing him to tap his own vocal resources but also by transforming his blindness and his whole body as well if you really want revolutionary change here it is the spectacle the drama of a man changed and charged and turned into the mysterious power of a vocabulary and a grammar called the blues a whole language in fact somethings got a hold of me it must be art if its a musician thats being grabbed art takes care of its own just as it takes care of us administering to the spot where we need to be moved and stirred the need which drives aretha to sing to moan to shout is identical in source to what drives us to hear her now these are real live needs and her art attends to hers no less than to ours talk about function and change and what do we think puts this art and these artists before us as vital resources for us life there are some people who need coltrane more urgently than a drink so karenga must be mistaken when he suggests that black artists should go around following the people the case would almost appear to be the reverse but not quite for both artist and audience go around following pursuing hungering for what keeps and makes them both alive persons who regard the social aspect of a humans reality as the whole story or as the most significant part cannot be blamed for their misguided efforts to apply an external rather than this native function to art since it can hardly occur to them that art has its own natural inherent builtin reason for being which is to liberate by being lifegiving and lifewitnessing and therefore a reflection of life now if art really went about as karenga and jones insist simply docilely following the people and what they take their needs to be there would be little chance of liberating them the notion that we are merely social beings is part of the chaos from which art has the power to free us and the notions which people bring to all the vital areas of life are in reality part of the deadly folly in which men black and white individualists and nationalists are forever perishing all people spend endless effort artists included in resisting the truth about their lives this question of the selfsufficiency of art and its connection with revolution cannot be overstressed art is inherently revolutionary part of its real force as a criticism of people and society is derived in part from its very diversity it is no accident that karenga harps on the values of the people he takes pains to do so in such a way as to suggest they are familiar to all indisputable and above all simple the needs of the people receive the same shortchanged treatment in the utterances of malcolm stokely carmichael and jones negroes are ruthlessly streamlined and standardized for convenient oversimplification theres nothing like it for enhancing ones persuasiveness but art with its diversity of points of view always manages to reveal people to be far more complex and various than we are otherwise willing to admit or to face for we seldom know quite what to do with this disturbing complexity this unneat unpredictableness human nature surprises and trips us up both jones and karenga stress change and movement this is central to their understanding of what a revolution should accomplish this is also central to an artist why else is the artist forever talking about freedom he needs freedom to move and freedom assumes an order of diversity in art that bewilders even the artist but the relevant point is this art is inherently revolutionary because the change it requires not to mention the changes it requires of the artist himself and the nature of that change is transformation it is also essentially personal rather than political and by being personal it is therefore at bottom religious which takes us to karengas real objection to the blues our creative motif must be revolution all art that does not discuss or contribute to revolutionary change is invalid that is why the blues are invalid they teach resignation in a word acceptance of realityand we have come to change reality this is a very curious position to be backed into it would surely relieve some of the absurdity if karenga would only allow just enough individuality to justify accepting so personal an attitude as resignation then he wouldnt be forced into the even more untenable position of rejecting so major a part of the peoples value system as the blues it would certainly behoove him to accept just enough reality to enable his objection to the blues to constitute a real objection shouldnt he accept just enough reality to come by some real alternatives to real resignation but it would never do for a person determined not to accept reality to accept real standards with which to replace the one he really doesnt like but of course karenga hasnt real reality in mind but simply a social one that is to say he has only a real part instead of the real whole so he can perhaps be forgiven nor is it his fault that he rejects his peoples past ways and past thinking a black nationalist can not escape assuming his peoples sense of reality is unreal how else could he reasonably define as his goal the establishment and the development of a culture for his people without first rejecting as mistaken the stubborn belief that black people already have a culture a tradition of which both the negros speech and abundant musical expression are a definitive and irrefutable part it is instructive to remember that karengas views are no random affair they are rigorously achieved and arrived at they form inevitable parts of a system that system being black cultural nationalism we now come to the third and final element which forms his criteria for an art that would be revolutionary in addition to being collective and functional black art must be committing this term turns out to be not a third element at all because to insist that art is to be revolutionary is simply another way of saying it is to be committed to revolution and knowing that art is to be collective we can assume that commitment cannot be a matter of personal choice since black art is accountable to what is called the people and apparently under their control any art whether black nationalist or not which has the misfortune to be so collective as to allow for no individuality must be totally impersonal as well and therefore a perfect paternalistic formula and framework for black slavery and black suicide and by way of conclusion let us refocus on this element of paternalism for it is the most characteristic and widespread feature to be found in the rhetoric of all sorts of spokesmen for black revolution not only artists renegade or otherwise but the people too who get flattered and burdened with so much tyrannical power are treated in this manner we all are we all are looked upon and regarded by our socalled black liberators as so many sheep there is a serious problem here among these our own revolutionaries they seem to have a serious case of shepherdcomplex and it is a tragedy for a people such as we to have produced a generation of youth who seem on the evidence so utterly indifferent to what all the fuss has always been about who no longer remember that revolution is aimed at freedom not control not regimentation not a mass of afroheaded robots but freedom and the black artists who jump into such a constricting bag for the sake of unity have surely placed themselves in a black straitjacket and with their mouths wide open to swallow a black mans cup of hemlock mitting or committed since this is traditionally valid it stands to reason that we should attempt to use it as the foundation for a rational construction to meet our present day needs and by no mere coincidence we find that the criteria is not only valid but inspiring that is why we say that all black art irregardless of any technical requirements must have three basic characteristics which make it revolutionary in brief it must be functional collective and committing it must be functional that is useful as we cannot accept the false doctrine of art for arts sake for in fact there is not such thing as art for arts sake all art reflects the value system from which it comes for if the artist created only for himself and not for others he would lock himself up somewhere and paint or write or play just for himself but he does not do that on the contrary he invites us over even insists that we come to hear him or to see his work in a word he expresses a need for our evaluation andor appreciation and our evaluation cannot be a favorable one if the work of art is not first functional that is useful so what then is the use of art our art black art black art must expose the enemy praise the people and support the revolution it must be like leroi jones poems that are assassins poems poems that kill and shoot guns and wrassle cops into alleys taking their weapons leaving them dead with tongues pulled out and sent to ireland it must be functional like the poem of another revolutionary poet from us clyde halisi who described the masters words as sun genies dancing through the crowd snatching crosses and st christophers from around niggers necks and passing the white gapped legs in their minds to simbas to be disposed of or in terms of painting we do not need pictures of oranges in a bowl or trees standing innocently in the midst of a wasteland if we must paint oranges and trees let our guerrillas be eating those oranges for strength and using those trees for cover we need new images and oranges in a bowl or fat white women smiling lewdly cannot be those images all material is mute until the artist gives it a message and that message must be a message of revolution then we have destroyed art for arts sake which is of no use anyhow and have developed art for all our sake art for mose the miner sammy the shoeshine boy t c the truck driver and k p the unwilling soldier in conclusion the real function of art is to make revolution using its own medium the second characteristic of black art is that it must be collective in a word it must be from the people and must be returned to the people in a form more beautiful and colorful than it was in real life for that is what art is everyday life given more form and color and in relationship to that the black artist can find no better subject than black people themselves and the black artist who does not choose or develop this subject will find himself unproductive for no one is any more than the context to which he owes his existence and if an artist owes his existence to the afroamerican context then he also owes his art to that context and therefore must be held accountable to the people of that context to say that art must be collective however raises four questions number one the question of popularization versus elevation two personality versus individuality three diversity in unity and four freedom to versus freedom from the question of popularization versus elevation is an old one what it really seeks to do is to ask and to answer the question whether or not art should be lowered to the level of the people or the people raised to the level of art our contention is that if art is from the people and for the people there is no question of raising people to art or lowering art to the people for they are one and the same thing as we said previouslyart is everyday life given more form and color and what one seeks to do then is to use art as a means of educating the people and being educated by them so that it is a mutual exchange rather than a oneway communication art and people must develop at the same time and for the same reason it must move with the masses and be moved by the masses for we should not demand that our people go to school to learn to appreciate art but that an artist go to school formally or informally to learn new and better techniques of expressing his appreciation for the people and all they represent and his disdain for anything and everything that threatens or hinders their existence then and only then can both the artist and the people move forward with a positive pace rooted to the reality of revolution the second question raised is the question of personality versus individuality now this question is one of how much the emphasis on collective art destroys the individuality of the artist we say that individualism is a luxury that we cannot afford moreover individualism is in effect nonexistent for since no one is any more than the context to which he owes his existence he has no individuality only personality individuality by definition is me in spite of everyone and personality is me in relation to everyone the one a useless isolation and the other an important involvement we have heard it even said that the individual is like an atom that which can no longer be reduced or the essence of humanity however aside from this being a rather strained analogy it does not prove that a man who wants to be an individual can stand alone for the atom itself is a part of a molecule and cannot exist without interdependence and even then it is at best a simple theoretical construction for the convenience of conversation we say that there is no virtue in a false independence but there is value in a real interdependence the third question raised with regard to collective art is an extension of the second one and that is does unity preclude diversity our answer to that is an emphatic no for there can be and is unity in diversity even as there can be diversity in unity what one seeks however is not a standardization of every move or creation but a framework in which one can create and avoid the european gift of trial and error one can seek the reality of the concept of diversity in unity or unity in diversity in listening to a trippin ensemble in a trippin ensemble the leader sets the pace and others come in or go out as it pleases them but in the end they all come to a very dynamic and overwhelmingly harmonious conclusion so it is with our dance two partners dance together the same dance and yet they provide us with a demonstration of that which is unique in each of them but that is not individualitythat is personality for it is an expression of uniqueness not isolation from but in relation to each other and the collective experience that they both have shared the last question is one of freedom to versus freedom from this is really a political question or social one and is one that raises contradiction for the artist who rejects the social interpretation of art however when he demands freedom to do something or freedom from the restriction that prohibits his doing something he is asking for a sociopolitical right and that as we said makes art social first and aesthetic second art does not exist in the abstract just like freedom does not exist in the abstract it is not an independent living thing it lives through us and through the meaning and message we give it and an artist may have any freedom to do what he wishes as long as it does not take the freedom from the people to be protected from those images words and sounds that are negative to their life and development the people give us the freedom from isolation and alienation and random searching for subject matter and artists in view of this must not ask for freedom to deny this but on the contrary must praise the people for this in conclusion the concept of collective art can best be expressed in the african proverb showing the interdependence of all by saying one hand washes the other the final thing that is characteristic of black art is that it must be committing it must commit us to revolution and change it must commit us to a future that is ours in a word it must commit us to all that is usyesterday today and the sunrise of tomorrow it must tell us like halisis poem maulana and word magic that we must give up the past or be found out and exposed as the notes of a new day come tripping through searching each ones heart for any traces of pevton place it must commit us to the fact that the earth is ours and the fullness thereof as leroi jones says you cant steal nothing from the white man hes already stole it he owes you anything you want even his life so black people take the shit you want take their lives if need but get what you want what you need dance up and down the street turn all the music up this is commitment to the struggle a commitment that includes the artist and the observer we cannot let each other rest there is so much to do and we all know we have done so little art will revive us inspire us give us enough courage to face another disappointing day it must not teach us resignation for all our art must contribute to revolutionary change and if it does not it is invalid therefore we say the blues are invalid for they teach resignation in a word acceptance of reality and we have come to change reality we will not submit to the resignation of our fathers who lost their money their women and their lives and sat around wondering what did they do to be so black and blue we will say again with brother leroi we are lovers and the sons of lovers and warriors and the sons of warriors therefore we will loveand unwillingly though necessarily make war revolutionary war we will not cry for those things that are gone but find meaning in those things that remain with us perhaps people will object violently to the idea that the blues are invalid but one should understand that they are not invalid historically they will always represent a very beautiful musical and psychological achievement of our people but today they are not functional because they do not commit us to the struggle of today and tomorrow but keep us in the past and whatever we do we cannot remain in the past for we have too much at stake in the present and we find our future much too much rewarding to be rejected let our art remind us of our distaste for the enemy our love for each other and our commitment to the revolutionary struggle that will be fought with the rhythmic reality of a permanent revolution there is a spirit of revolution abroad in the shadowy world of letters in black america not all black writers are attuned i f to it of course and some are even opposed to it which is to be expected also one supposes great change is always terrifying especially to those who have found niches in the established structure and wish to remain secure but change is upon us there is therefore a wide divergence of opinion among black writers as to their role in society as to their role in the black revolution as to their role as artistsall these considerations tied into and touching on the others negro digest polled some black writers both famous and unknown asking the questions which are published on page the questions elicited from the writers opinions relative to the books and writers which have influenced them the writers who are most important to them in terms of achievement and promise and what they think about the new movement toward a black aesthetic and the preoccupation with the black experience aspects of the larger black consciousness movement the replies from the writers are extraordinarily rich and no attempt will be made in this issue of the magazine to collate and analyze all the material rather pertinent statements from the questionnaires are published on these pages dealing primarily with the last dozen questions along with a general essay intended as background and summary richard wright once wrote that both black and white americans resist facing the truth of the racist nature of this country a statement which on the face of it does not seem so profound and vet it is at the beginning of with at least half a dozen various government and private agencies engaged in studying the causes of upheaval in the cities the sharpness of richard wrights insight falls into focus both black and white americans accept the proposition after years together in this land that it is necessary to spend millions of dollars hold dozens of hearings and engage the services of platoons of sociologists and myriad other social scientists in order to determine why black americans are raising unholv hell m against the conditions of their lives which white americans have forced upon them and richard wright also understood why black americans cling more desperately than white americans to the rules of the game of illusion the game is easier to play for whiles after all they have all the advantages and guilt and a nagging feeling of indecency however uncomfortable at times are bearable black americans on the other hand have no defenses at all beyond their flimsy veil once that is torn away and they must confront the reality of what they are and of their collaboration against their own humanity they will have no alternative but to act but actiongenuine effective actionis w what thev fear most in succumb ing to the rage and bitterness which are the natural fruits of their degraded existence thev would face the ultimate dangersimprisonment or death and of course thev cannot do that they have made the other choice they have chosen to live however dishonorably and they have found a million w wavs of rationalizing the failure to act the refusal to end the limitations other men have placed on their freedom richard wrights knowledge of the truth about americans was the strength of his work or as many of his critics would argue its weakness for these critics would no forgive him for not diluting his rage and clarity in obscurity of saunders reddings distinguished career as professor and author spans more years than many of the writers polled have been alive and of course unlike many of the younger writers mr redding is familiar with an extraordinary range of literature his answers to the questions naturally reflect his solid base in traditional literary approaches and attitudes mr redding is one of the living writers who was personally acquainted with richard wright and mr redding has no doubts that the later works of the late richard wright suffered because in his european exile wright had lost touch with the living american reality and wright himself thought so too mr redding says saunders redding does mr redding see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic no not in america besides aesthetics has no racial national or geographical boundaries beauty and truth the principal components of aesthetics are universal and should the black writers journey toward art lead through exploitation of the black experience the journey should carry the writerblack or whitethrough the familiar country of his mind and heart through what he knows best and feels most mr redding grew impatient with the question as to what is the most important novel written by a black writer since invisible man again youre asking for absolutes and damn it in this business there are no absolutes except in a negative sense theres no such thing as the most important novel and theres been no really good novel by a negro in years mr redding also said that there have been no important black playwrights in this or any other centurynot in americaalice walker a very talented young woman out of rural georgia has been fantastically busy in the past few years but has now settled down in mississippi for serious work like samuel allen she finds both john a williams and mari evans among the promising and important writers and she thinks the man who cried i am is probably the most important novel by a black writer since invisible man as to whether black writers should direct their work toward black audiences miss walker replies black writers should direct their work towards an audience some imaginary ideal audience that will appreciate what they have to say novelist as the most important black american writer of all time there was no attempt by n egro digest to poll only those writers who have published books or to exclude those whose ideas are different from the editors and so the writers represented here cover the whole ranse of creativitv from those authors highly esteemed by the literary establishment to those who arc known only to a small coterie of local readers some of the writers are grandparents and others are barely in their twenties unsurprisingly then there are contrasting and conflicting viewpoints and the distance between the educational qualifications of the respondents is sometimes very great indeed generallv the older writers and profit from it to write solely for a black audience is limiting and presumes too much that they will appreciate your efforts that they will try to understand you that they will care enough about your work to buy your books and that white people could never get anything be made better one might say from what one writes my own family has squashed my illusions that black audiences are more perceptive or moved more than white ones the only time they will read my material is when l send it to them i think it is only important that we write from within ourselves and that we direct our efforts outward period i would have liked for victor hugo to like my stories quite as much as i admire his one of the younger writers whose work most of which is as yet unpublished shows uncommon talent carolyn rodgers replied yes of course to the question do you see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic and her reply to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences was eloquently simple yes when they want to and no when they dont want to and ultimately they always will when the realization comes that the only audience which will listen to anything that takes guts to be said is a black audience charles wright an alumnus of the handy school where james jones wrote his first novel from here to eternity is author of two published novels the messenger and the wig mr wright is unknown as individual and as author to most black readers and indeed to other black writers although his two novels received favorable notices it came as a surprise and perhaps also as revelation to have mr wright suggest the novel the confessions of nat turner by william styron as a book dealing with the negros role in history which is recommended for study by negro children the literary value of mr styrons novel aside most black writers have reservations about the book and some black writers have reacted violently against it beacon press will publish a collection of essays by black writers dealing with mr styrons work which incidentally has received only race reviews in the white press mr wright answers hellno to the question of whether richard wright had lost touch with the living american reality in his european exile however he does not think that the black writer should deliberately direct his work toward black audiences nor does he feel that the black writers journey toward art should lead deliberately through exploitation of the black experience as to whether there is a future for the idea of a black aesthetic mr wright says perhaps julian mayfield returned to the united states recently after several years in africa and europe an able novelist he has not been represented by a published work since his third novel the grand parade mr mayfield who is working on a new novel is a teaching fellow at cornell university perhaps surprisingly mr mayfield agrees that richard wright lost touch with the living american reality by remaining in exile and mr mayfield is one of the experienced authors who did not select richard wright as one of the three most important black american writers of all time he named w e b du bois james baldwin and ralph ellison in that order mr mayfield was tothepoint in his reply to the question as to whether the black writers journey toward art should lead through exploitation of the black experience a silly question of course what other experience is he the black writer going to have mr mayfield believes that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences even if they cannot persuade black people to buy writing by blacks to mr mayfield there have been no novels bv black writers worth mentioning since publication of invisible man to a younger more militant poet as a racist and a nazi because of the unadulterated hatred expressed toward white americans in the younger poets recent work the older poet points out quite logically that racism is just as stultifying from blacks as it is from whites and yet the older poet admits the power and beauty of the younger poets work without also admitting its poetic honesty the essential question it would seem is this are not black people in america systematically and literally murdered and degraded by white racism and arc not rage and bitterness and hatred perfectly natural and legitimate responses to this murder and degradation is the hatred of the jews for their nazi executioners merely equivalent to the germans hatred of the jews for their jewishness but back to the poll the second choice as most important black writer was langston hughes although the late poetplaywriglu edged out james baldwin and ralnh kllison bv only a few votes baldwin and ellison were evenly matched and web du bois had the next largest number of votes the third choice as most important hack writer was james r i f j t conrad kent rivers is a poet whose work has appeared in nearly all the recent anthologies of poetry by black authors sometime in the near future paul breman will publish a collection of mr rivers poems in london currently on leave from teaching duties in the metropolitan chicago area mr rivers is trying his hand at freelancing and intensive work on a major project the system of dantes hell by leroi jones is mr rivers choice as the most important novel by a black writer since invisible man and novelist ronald fair gets his vote as the most promising young novelist mr rivers feels that richard wright did lose touch to a degree during his exile but his techniques continued to improve is there a future for the black aesthetic idea yes the only hope we must create a black aesthetic must the black writer exploit the black experience to achieve art it is only through our exploitation of our experience that our vision and our ventures will ring true for the literate should black writers direct their work toward black audiences we must being there first our literature is our legacy if we fail to write for black people wein effectfail to write at all keorapetse william kgositsile is a refugee from south africa known affectionately as willie among his friends and acquaintances because it is difficult at first to learn to pronounce his name mr kgositsile has the advantage of being familiar with many african writers unknown in america but he also is very much a part of the contemporary black writers scene in america mr kgositsile does not believe that richard wrights work suffered because he had lost touch with the living american reality he sees other reasons why that work suffered believe that his wrights later works suffered because he became concerned with humanity instead of specifically black people humanity is a tricky abstraction and the establishment of a black aesthetic is the only future the black writer has in mr kgositsiles opinion there is no other way it could be if the art reflects and reflects upon the lives of black people the point of view of black writers is black and their experience as black people colors their ethics and aesthetics if they are honest people should the black writers journey toward art lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience through honest involvement with the black experience a writers language that is his images rhythms earliest memories and so forth come from his peoples experiencereal or imagined and art like clothing belongs specifically to a people and is identifiable that way should black writers direct their work toward black audiences yes they should they must unless they are schizophrenic l dont think the question even arises every selfrespecting artist addresses himself to his people rrooks and margaret walker was w mentioned most after jones as most important black playwright lcroi jones again received most mentions followed by lorraine hansbcrry and langston iimhes i the second choice as most important black playwright again was lcroi lone with langston hughes loften mitestci and the nigerian wole sovinka named in descending order the third choice as most important black playwright was lorraine hansbcrry langston hmihcs was runawav first choice as the most important black poet of the century with to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences poet margaret danner replied a writer should write what he feels and yet i believe that we should help each other if our talent is writing we can help in this wayby deliberately directing some of our work toward black audiences because of the predicament that the black man is in and faces those of us who are black should unite to extricate ourselves and each other do you believe that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience i believe and have tried for many years to do something positive about this conviction that the black should be awakened to his vast beauty he will then be so enthusiastic that he will automatically write of the experience and is there a future for the black aesthetic to the extent that this group includes those who have proven similar intentions by accepting and utilizing their help i feel that their exclusion of interested lovers of black is a hindrance jean wheeler smith is a detroiter who reversed the usual arrangement by making a life in mississippi her deep involvement in the civil_rights movement during snccs most dramatic days in the south had a lot to do with her making that decision and finding the strength to follow it mrs smith has published short stories and a moving autobiographical statement in a national women s magazine and she is now working to complete her first novel mrs smith does not feel competent to judge whether richard wright lost touch in his european exile never studied wrights works chronologically i think i read a range of his works though and to me theyre good over the years mrs smiths reply to the question of whether the concept of the black aesthetic has a future was refreshing im not sure i know what the term means i do think though that writing about things because theyre black and need to be recorded is legitimate for a few years and then later on a minor scale after the record has been made think the literature will have to be good just because it is good and makes its point that doesnt mean it wont still be about being black she believes the black experience should be exploited by black writers seeking art i think that the black experience has great historical and social significance for black and white people and it should be the focus of black writing where the writers temperament and background permit should black writers then direct their work toward black audiences yes anything you write for white audiences probably isnt going to do you and other black people much good except if you get get paid well for doing itwhich is another matter what you write for white folks is probably going backward or at most remaining stationary since all you can do for them is explain what already happened instead of explore new ways for things to happenor at least new ways and useful in the struggle of looking at what happened john wideman is a former football hero and rhodes scholar whose first novel a glance a way received generally good notices last fall mr wideman admitted that he is unfamiliar with that school of black writers which seeks to establish the black aesthetic and pretended not to know the meaning of the black experience he had not read richard wrights work and had no opinions on which writers and books were important explained mr wideman sometimes i havent sampled enough of the relevant writing at other times i just react negatively to any such popularity polls the only interesting aspect of opinion is the ground upon which it is based the skeletal history of preferences retains only an arbitrary hierarchy to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences mr widemans reply was a sharp one if thats the best they can do or what they want to do what about the future of the black aesthetic idea if by a black aesthetic you mean art and literature which is blackoriented i would say yes it has a future and l would say the word writers is too restrictive black creative artists i feel would more aptly serve as the black creative artist applies to his own works the discriminating standards of excellence by which he judges the works of others and as he remains involvedas do all artists with self and situation regardless of the manner of projection he will inevitably create a mystique in which excellence craftsmanship and blackness have interfused miss evans had some provocative things to say about black poets and craft if black poets share a fault it may be that we are through with a poem before it is crafted many black poets have excellent material but are evidently too impatient to wait for the results they could get this is true of aspiring white poets also but since being published is more of an achievement for a black writer the published work of a black poet is accorded a status it might not receive if he were white robert hayden is a craftsman leroi jones not only crafts but also has something to say and ted joans has a sincerity which transcends any weakness in crafting leroi jones i feel is important the other two are simply able poets as i see it should black writers direct their work toward black audiences some things should be said at home and some in the marketplace black writers should decide whether what they have to say needs to be said to white or black folks and attempt to market their work accordingly there are some other things whitey needs to be toldand some things the brother needs to hear there was a long period between publication of her poem for my people and publication of her novel jubilee when readers saw little of the work of margaret walker and she was missed apparently the poet had parceled her time among three important endeavors rearing her children teaching and researching and writing her long novel now she is being seen and heard again asked if black writers should direct their work toward black audiences miss walker replied in the affirmative who else can verify what is writ ten or identify with the work writers should not write exclusivlv for black or white audiences but most inclusively after all it is the business of all writers to write about the human condition and all humanity must be involved both in the writing and in the reading is there a future for those writers who want to establish a black aesthetic why not the black aesthetic r has a rich if undiscovered past this goes back in time to the beginning of civilization in egypt babylonia india china persia and all the islamic world that precedes the renaissance of the europeans we have lived too long excluded by the anglosaxon aesthic as to whether the black writer should exploit the black experience in the journey toward art miss walker was eloquent where else should the journey lead the black writer is the black experience how can the human experience transcend humanity its the same thingalternating desire for assimilation and separation but the division is both deeper and more subtle than that there are those writers who arc committed to the truth as reflected through the prism of their own experiences and of their total heritage and there are those writers who have adjusted their vision and their goals to the guidelines established by people who not only do not share with them crucial life experiences but who in effect are historically and culturally placed in a position which demands that the validity of the unshared experiences be denied all the writers polled here say that black writersand all writers should direct their work towards truth it is like coming out for god and motherhood but whose truth and who is to judge whether truth has been achieved clearly some of the w riters have set out on an independent course shucking the chains the literary young s e sam anderson is one of the few under writers who believe that richard wright lost touch with the livins ameriw can reality in his european exile a merica went through some very significant changes visavis black people and one would have had to be here to really dig upon the sophistication and institutionalization and acculturation of racism against blacks at home and abroad aesthetic what alice ch january negro digest the journey toward art mr anderson believes should lead through a conscious and deliberate exploration of the black experience real art is life or a mirror of life or an improver on life and since people are life and since they live in a society then art must be in our case black first and socially educational should black writers direct their work toward black audiences we are an oppressed people what is therefore needed is a revolution a revolution of self family society nation values culture the black writer including the cinema photographer radio dj and photographerjournalist must necessarily aid in the liberation struggle he cannot aid by talking black songs and programs to the enemy ofayswhites he must talk and listen and talk and help black people this will not only aid the liberation but also help perpetuate black art and humanistic art in other words in the process of directing his work toward black people he is creating a new man a new humanism unlike the pallid and selfcentered old humanism of the exploitive west ulia fields who returned to the south north carolina after living in new york city is a winner of a national endowment for the arts grant for this season the young writer believes that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences and this work should be at the service of the peopleart for the peoples sake it ought not to be schoolmarm stuff or dinner and a show stuff for unreffective bored people that leaves out the majority of black peoplea truly vast audience the real problem at this time ought to be how shall we reach black audiences miss fields comments on the question of the black aesthetic the negro caravan is read by people who have not heard of recent literature in the future the only relevant literature will be that a which has gone directly to the heart of blackness as to whether the black writers journey toward art should lead irected toward humanity which is indisputable but when humanity is interpreted as wearing a white face then what is the black writers alternative if the black audience does not constitute humanity then what audience does on page of this magazine is a quote from a review by louis simpson a white poet of gwen through exploitation of the black experience miss fields had some specific footnotes to add to her reply the black experience seems the most intense experience in the modern world it is better that black people write it ourselves rather than have it written for us exploitativelv the exploitatively is a reference to the three white writers miss fields selected as most important william styron robert penn warren and allen tate all southerners in excellent standing said miss fields by their good literary fortune they remind us that they are still assumed to understand blacks better than blacks understand themselves woodie king jr is a young playwright out of detroit now living in new york city and working through mobilization for youths with young people interested in the theater arts he is founder of the it is not generation january negro digest i t a i concept east theater in detroit where his first plays were produced and he once toured universities performing in malcolm boyds plays mr king also writes stories and is working on a novel mr king does not agree that richard wrights later works suffered because wright lost touch with the living american reality by remaining in europe he feels that wrights works suffered because he had money and security and did not live close to the lifeline in both europe and america mr king also feels there is a future for writers of the black aesthetic school because more black people are going to be reading because of the rise in education and the new leisure black writers should direct their work toward black audiences mr king feels he also thinks that john a williams the man who cried am is the most important novel by a black american writer since invisible man and that leroi jones is about miles ahead of the next living poet ernest j gaines published his second novel of love and dust last fall and will be represented by a collection of his short stories in the spring relatively unknown on the writers conference circuit he nevertheless is highly regarded by his fellow writers he lives in san francisco but wants to return to his native louisiana to research an important novel he intends to write mr gaines agrees with those who feel that richard wright lost touch with the living american exile by remaining so long abroad wright was a man of strong passionnot an intellectual he had to get his material out of the american soil not out of a european library mr gaines response to the question of whether there is a future in the black aesthetic concept as long as they black writers write about people people people people and not just about problems and should the journey toward art lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience ive always said that a man black writer or not should do what he can do best should black writers direct their work toward black audiences no more than french writers should the artist is the only free man left he owes nobody nothingnot even himself he should write what he wants when he wants and to whomever he wants if he is true he will use that material which is closest to him those people who have experienced much of what he the artist has will see themselves in his work if they dont then no amount of preaching by the artist will do any good robert boles background has been markedly different from that of most of the writers whose opinions are published here he grew up in the relatively more enlightened east traveled extensively under privileged circumstances and was removed by circumstance from the center of the racial w hirlpool in america and yet his published works show very clearly that he has not stood clear of the maelstrom his first novel was the people one knows and one of his stories appeared in langston hughes anthology the best short stories by negro americans later this spring his second novel curling will be published mr boles does not feel that richard wrights long stay in europe resulted in wright losing touch with the living american reality as to whether black writers should exploit the black experience in straining toward art mr boles is ambivalent dont believe that becoming a professional negro benefits art and one does not have to be one a professional negro to write about negroes the negro has enough working against himwhy should he limit his output to the black experience there are other experiences and he does not think that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences black writers should direct their work to the biggest audience they can find to their countrymen and to people all over the world to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences gwendolyn brooks replied no they should concern themselves with truth truth should be put upon paper that phrase direct their work suggests a secret contempt for the intelligence of the black audience her reply to the question do you believe that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience was the following i dont like the use here of the word exploitation but i believe that integrity essential and artistic will require not only involvement with what is known as the black experience but saturation does the famous poet see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic certainly a most exciting concept because definite because an entity because distinct gwendolyn brooks is the only black poet ever to be honored with a pulitzer prize she has published six books including one novel and recently delivered the manuscript of her seventh book the mecca to her publishers in new york a housewife as well as a distinguished poet miss brooks also has a full schedule as instructor at two chicago colleges chicago teachers college north and columbia college and also doubles as advisor to a group of young writers who meet regularly in her home her published works are selected poems the bean eaters annie allen a street in bronzeville bronxeville boys and girls for children and maud martha the novel like most of the writers polled miss brooks feels that richard wright who lived in chicago during her youth is the most important black writer produced by america in fact she does not feel he has any peers i am not intrigued by any novels written by black writers before or since native son she says like several of the older over writers playwright william b branch displayed a certain amount of impatience with the content and implications of some of the survey questions he declined to state an opinion relative to the questions dealing with most important novelists poets playwrights etc im afraid you lose me with all this most important jazz he said this implies a critical faculty and audacity im not sure i have or want to have asked if he believes the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience mr branch replied to each his own i for one think a black writer would be foolish to ignore the wealth of material and theme involved in the black experience but i would never confine anyone to it alone art is to be found ultimately in any human experience it depends upon who is doing the looking should black writers direct their work toward black audiences again to each his own though this has long been a subject of speculation and confusion i think ultimately each writer must be allowed to decide for himself there are some writing situations which would demand this others which would not some in which this would be an admirable opportunity others in which it would not m l think the schizophrenic aspects of a black writer in largely white america have been and still are a crippling load on an already overburdened entity perhaps he can solve this on an imwritingonlyformeandmypeople basis perhaps not know for me it is a dilemma l must wrestle with each time l try to write sometimes l lean more heavily in one direction sometimes in another hopeful that both black and white audiences will gain some though necessarily differing insight from what results all of this is complicated of course by the unfortunate fact that the black audience reading public book and ticket buyer etc is still a small and largely undeveloped group especially in the theater john o killens whose second novel and then we heard the thunder was one of the three novels listed as most important since invisible man sided with those who feel that the late richard wright had lost touch with the living american reality in his long european exile said mr killens think that a couple of his wrights later books such as the long dream reflected a loss of contact with the then black american reality nevertheless he remained to his dying day and to this day the greatest black novelist in the world living or dead despite mr killens opinion that wright had lost contact he still chose a wright novel the outsider as the most important novel by a black writer published since invisible man a ithough there was much in this novel did not care for in terms of bad writing neverthless the symbolism captured the black mans situation in american life as no other novel has before or after we are essentially outsiders in the land of our birth owing loyalties to no one but our black selves is there a future for the writers seeking to establish a black aesthetic yes believe that each creative writer must ultimately find that aesthetic which works best for him must find that rhythm that structure that style that idiom which the materials of his art and life dicate to him he ultimately becomes a slave to his aesthetic at the same time his aesthetic becomes the writers slave to be bent to his moods to be broken down from time to time and molded and forged into something new and altogether different at the whims of the writer and to suit the writers artistic purposes the writer is the ruthless exploiter faced with his aesthetic since the materials of most black writers come out of the black experience it would seem that a black aesthetic would be a most viable and fruitful one for the black artist but only if he continually seeks to reach the stage of a langston hughes or a charles white painter where he sees beauty in his be too gloomy a picture to bear with any kind of patience we are in a subservient position the smallest and the greatest of us we have cajoled pleaded tommed protested achieved rioted defied unified you name it but white supremacists have dug their heels into the ground and will settle for nothing less than outright confrontation in the streets of america welfare and poverty program are the white powers answer to our demand for freedom meanwhile we feed upon each other and hungrily pick unbuttered crumbs from massas table meanwhile we have no theaters or any other means of production and any attempt to buy our own puts us in the position where they can cut off our supply lines via unions and real estate holdings at a moments notice there is no artist among us whose individual success will free the rest of us there is no substitute for human rights not even art miss childress departed from the specific questions to speak with eloquence and passion about herself black people and america have ever been in the position of having to study and understand the greatness or meanness of others and of making whatever adjustment is necessary to exist in their world the oppressed forever studying the oppressor to be oppressed is hard but it is harder yet when one is expected to appreciate it the one who holds me down tells me how to react to his action in order to survive with his goodwill it is ever painful i do believe that the action of white supremacists have cut us off from the enjoyment and appreciation of the finest white artists and has benumbed the appreciation on ourselves as a peopleas a whole look to the white society which surrounds our ghettos a white child or adult who has been unloved by a parent neglected in some way or other must be nursed by psychologists for years in order to lead him back to a sense of well being my god what will it take for us to feel a fraction of that wellbeing after the hatred and attacks we have been subjected to for centuries the plaster now slapped on our wounds is welfare and poverty programwhich is another and more subtle attack this society tells us they would rather support us as charity cases than to open the doors and let us win or fail live or die as full citizens of this country if one lacks an appreciative attitude about this then you are bitter we can be bitter or numb there is no other choice a negro without feeling numb seems to survive a few moments inoger than we who are bitter as to who are the most important white american writers miss childress had the following comments i doubt if i am capable of summing up the best and the greatest food served at other peoples tables i remember best what has somewhat slaked my thirst and eased my hunger pains people who pity us leave me cold i dont even feel like evaluating walt whitman and i know he was different and new to a great extent and belongs in the company of thoreau there was only one john brown and one elijah lovejoy but then they werent writers were they addison gayle jr is one of the few contemporary writers who wins the approval of both the revolutionary and the conservative wings of the black literary world an instructor of english in the prebaccaulaureate program of the city college of new york mr gayles articles and stories have appeared in a number of periodicals mr gayle is emphatic in his disagreement with the contention that richard wrights later works suffered because of his long exile in europe wright lost some of the pow er displayed in native son in his later novel the outsider but two of his most powerful works white man listen and eight men were written abroad however mr gayle does not see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish the black aesthetic the black aesthetic has always been a part of the lives black people to investigate these lives and the conditions surrounding them is to reveal an aesthetic inherent in the soul of black people nor does mr gayle support the idea that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience do not believe in the journey art must always be subordinated to truth and that truth no matter how uncomfortable can not be denied by adhering to romantic criteria proposed by critics who have no cognizance of truth and less of life on the other hand mr gayle does believe that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences serious consideration however must be given to this question perhaps this is where black literature should have first directed itself perhaps wright was wrong in arguing that black people knew about the conditions under which other black people lived and that the w riter should therefore importune white people to listen one may editors undoubtedly since white america goes out of its way to make the black man negro feel that he is a part of this country this melting pot why indeed do we need the word negro why do we need ghettoes poor schools substandard housing workless fathers unpublished poets and other accidents of the melting pot and if this melting pot does exist why did blacks get burned so badly mr hayden what are television radio movies newspapers and weekly news magazines if not ideological weaponswhite ideology twentyfour hours a day at every conceivable level white concepts are inforced and reinforced upon black people what we do not need mr hayden is people like you telling us what we need the editor continues his drive against blackness with this assertion a belligerent race pride moves these celebrants of black_power to declare themselves not simply poets but negro poets i would say a belligerent ignorance moved mr hayden to make such a statement such an ignorance enabled him to use a term like black_power which clearly shows that he has no concept of white power or even of selfpower for that matter an ignorance that should realize that those celebrants of black_power are really in essence celebrants of self of a people of me and yes mr hayden celebrants of you and few if any would reduce themselves to defending a tired overused cliche like black_power obviously the editor is not only out of touch with black poets but wishes to antagonize them by calling them negro poets no such animal when used in that frame of reference exists most if not all of the black poets writing today contend that being a negro is only a state of mind ie just like negroland the editor counters with words from one of the first widely read negro poets countee cullen in which mr cullen states that he be considered a poet not a negro poet for he did not want to be restricted to racial themes nor have his poetry judged solely on the basis of its relevance to the negro struggle first mr cullen and mr hayden continue to perpetuate a very dangerous myth in that they presuppose that poets other than black poets or black critics are qualified to judge black or negro poetry i believe that this is an absurdity to say the least how can one who is not a part of our culture a part of our immediate life a part of us judge us how can they wasp have a proper perspective to work from if there is to be judgment then we as afroamericans are better prepared to pass judgment on them we blacks have a much wider perspective to work from for we are the products of a dual culture ie shakespeare during the day and leroi jones at night or americanism during the day and survival at night and to john henry you taught us that a man could go down like a man and to you sterling brown you taught that in poetry the people their lifestyle their language and their culture should not be forgotten arna bontemps who is best known for his prose leaves little doubt in my mind to the validity of his poetry he is lyrical and his poems denote a musical quality langston hughes who left us in may of shows that he is still alive i believe that hayden errs in telling us that mr hughes at his death had the distinction of being the only american negro man of letters able to support himself by writing if i am not mistaken james baldwin has this distinction also langston hughes being one of the most important writers of the century could and should have been better represented i too and jazzonia lead the sad array of his poems i have recently completed his the panther and the lash and know too well that the editor had much more to select from the emasculated countee cullen as one would expect if one was under the influence of robert hillyer john keats and a e housman emasculates most of his poetry even with these handicaps cullens feeling comes through in for a lady i know she even thinks that up in heaven her class lies late and snores while poor black cherubs rise at seven to do celestial chores a shade of light were the poems of frank m davis his sarcasm was biting and left pains try arthur ridgewood md he debated whether as a poet to have dreams and beans or as a physician have a long car and caviar dividing his time between both he died from a nervous breakdown caused by worry from rejection slips and final notices from the finance company i also liked robert whitmore and giles johnson phd of robert haydens poems frederick douglass moved me most owen dodson and margaret danner will be heard dudley randalls booker t and web is printed here which contradicts something dudley once told me about having poems printed and reprinted in anthologies the forementioned poem was in beyond the blues edited by rosey pool margaret walkers for my people continues to stand out as does her lineage and molly means gwendolyn brooks one of my favorites displays her work with all the irony and surprise that is only hers she has a downtoearth use of images and an easy flowing rhythm i espe dally liked negros hero and hunchback girl she thinks of heaven james a emmanuels poems are tight and full as in the negro never saw him never can hypothetical haunting man eyes asaucer yessir bosssir dice aclicking razor flicking theness froze him in a dance aness never had a chance mari evans continues to play with words beautifully naomi madgett and g c oden are ably spoken for as is oliver pitcher ted joans voice in the crowd captures the true meaning of the poet if you should seea manwalking down a crowded streettalking aloudto himself dont runin the opposite direction but run toward himfor he is a poet you have nothing to fearfrom the poet but the truth calvin c herntons young negro poet tells a good story as does his madhouse gerald w barrax and conrad kent rivers are worth reading and rereading leroi jones one of the few black poets in this book is not properly represented most of the poems are from an earlier transitional period and do not reflect his blackness as i am sure leroi would have wanted it mr hayden says that mr jones is an advocate of art as protest and propaganda and he favors the cultivation of a black art which would reject white aesthetic values first if i may be so bold to speak for jones leroi advocates an art of and for the people ie art for peoples sake he also believes as i do that black art in its purest form will not only educate entertain and elevate but will instill in the people an awareness of self jones believes in bringing black art to the people and in essence bringing them survival survival as a people and as a culture he rejects pure imitation and brings about new standards new values new art ie black aesthetic values mr hayden also states that much of jones poetry is in no legitimate sense racist or propagandist this is to say that some of jones poetry is racist etc etc etc i find that statement racist and thats going some for a negro jones poetry is black which is problack propeople proliving ie protomorrow the editor feels that jones poetry is favored by the nonacademic poets does that mean that he is favored by poets ud and me are running j so fast that the two i f birds over neds head kztksis are slowin down in the sky and now they are passing behind the low cloud which must be the one sprinkling these few rain drops on us but we are still running faster than the drops me and cud they know where the devil is at cud is ahead because he aint afraid of the devil but i am and we are running along the fence and cud is leaping over i am sliding on the little slope beside the fence catching myself on the leaning old fence post pulling up and then i am standing high on the fat fence post looking at cud as the big hole in the seat of his overalls shows his black skin and his legs roll away over the field ned is standing near the stump waving at us like he found the greatest secret in the world and am standing higher on the post puffing stretching out my arms like a bird so that i can see if i can see the devil beating his wife if i can see from here i am staying here i am a waterfall flying off that post and i must be a river because the fence is shaking and trembling and snaking like the dead trees did in the stream when we were fishing a waterfall can put out the devil in a hot hell so i am running faster and then the sun stands on top of me and then hides his head again and you should see my shadow leap away from the side of myself just like when i was swinging from the oak limb on cuds rope yesterday and higher and higher and im gone look at ned but i am looking only at cud when he slows down whats he slowing for he must see something ned stops waving me on if i really see this devil im gonna be scared of everything for the rest of my life but cud he sees something and he keeps seeing it and now hes waving and it is my turn to see but i am slowing then i am running faster and faster as the sun comes out over the center of the field like a fat pillar of golden air and the rain is catching up with me and i can see it on the grass and feel it climbing over my muddy bare feet cleaning the stink off hurry blue you missin it man what they yelling me on for they see im coming and while im coming i strain to see what they see but i dont see nothing but the sun shining down from the sky and the dark field all around shaking in the wind and the rain striking across the light and on the grass i slide and i am there look ned is crazy they dancin cud he crazy too he leans in on the stump squinting at two figures like little carved dolls on top of that old stump its an old stump rotten and a hole is right in the center the rings for age are around that hole which is a rot hole and the rings are like little ditches splinters and twigs stick out of that stump but not like the two figures dancing in the light around the center hole and when i see it i close my mouth shut then my mouth drops open on its own and i feel the rain spirits soaking into me and cud is whispering a little and am shivering because the sun was hot but now it is raincold and the little dolls on the stump are dancing faster i see the devil dressed in red swinging a whip around his head snorting smoke when a rain drop strikes striking the other on the back the devils wife is dressed in white and the devils wife is falling and she falls into the hole but she catches the edges of the stump and the devil pulls her up and gets on top of her and i am watching him straddle her and then i hear a scream and the wind is slashing me with rain sun is gone just like that and in the field i am alone cud and ned are racing away yelling and when i look at the stump only the twigs dance in the wind slow back and forth growing bigger and bigger as the sun flicks off and on off and on clouds running and both of them are getting taller and taller giants with hands so big that the fingers are reaching for me now and then i am stumbling over my legs leaping with my heart which i can feel driving a river all over my body and i fly they are way ahead of me and i dont know whats in back of me and dont see anything but the devil chasing me and at home i am puffing out everything watching cuds eyes and neds eyes when we all climb on the back of papas wagon which papa is driving into the yard and i know its my turn to feed the mule but i still am puffing when papa gets down and thats my papa he knows everything yall git your chores did fore it start lightnin i am puffing and cud and ned climb down but i cannot stop puffing and papa hears me puffing and i cant talk because the devil is still chasing the road and i point into the sky where the sun is setting and where the rain is still coming and going my papa dont care nothing about it and he is saying boy that aint lightnin and i am still puffing and then i have to get off the wagon and they all looking at me rainin and sunshinin at the same time says ned and he whispers something to cud who dont say nothing except work his mouth and papa says rain under the sun you stick a pin in the ground and put your ear to it and you can hear the devil beating his wife we know it says ned i tell my papa i know it and my head is nodding up and down up and down dizzy and i have to say it i have to say we didnt hear the devil beating his wife this time because we see him do it and my papa is looking at all of us he is going to holler at us but he dont because he sees something maybe over our heads he sees him coming and maybe out of my eyes too raining and i have to tell him but i dont right then how come he beating her i ask my papa is unhitching them mules and we all around him and he tells us the truth and the truth is because it is raining and sunshining at the same time the rain spirits are coming strong now and my papa he says ah you got to do is to stick a pin in the ground or a stump and put your ear to it and you can hear the whole thing now yall git and do them chores but we are standing there dripping which is a lot of rain by now and i feel a river rising up in me and i see cuds eye and cud he looks at ned and ned he looks at me and i am licking my bottom lip with my tongue tasting the sunny salt in the rain and i am going to be the first to tell him im going to tell my papa we see the devil during the first half of the s there were no events that mirrored the utter impoverishment of negro creative intellectuals so much as those publicized glamorous meetings that go under the imposing title of negro writers conferences these literary conventionsinblackandtan are without a doubt the nearest thing imaginable to those congressional talkfests in washington d c where every elected representative knows it is his bounden duty to be presentfor the record but only for the record because no one has any intention of passing one bit of positive pending legislation this is another way of saying that negro writers conferences settle nothing solve nothing pose nothing analyze nothing plan nothing create nothingnot even a decent new literary reviewwhich is the least any bunch of serious selfrespecting writers with a gripe ought to do these conferences are comic parodies on the serious substance and reality of negro life which negro literature is alleged to reflect they are engineered by leading writers who when they are not sweating over the manuscripts of secondrate protest novels are chafing at the bit for a dialogue in public with white liberals and the metropolitan press but the inconoclastic nonparticipating observer at these conferences has to wonderwhy these writers who have the unmitigated gall to pursue a dialogue with whites cannot monitor even a positive selfcritical dialogue in john o killens and the harlem writers guild staged such a conference under the auspices this time of the new school for social research in new york in there were two writers conferences one in april staged by killens and his literary group and one in february by the american festival of negro arts at fairleigh dickinson university the latter represented a radically dissident outgroup neither of these conferences can be fully understood unless one is explained in terms of the other and both have to be interpreted in terms of another organizationthe american society of african culture this background also takes in the controversy of several years standing in american negroafrican relations over the philosophical and aesthetic concept of negritude the cultural mystique considered applicable to all peoples of african descent the american festival of negro arts afna conference was the direct result of a split from the american society of african culture amsac this split came about when amsac hedged on carrying out satisfactorily the parent bodys implied cultural program among american negroes relations in amsac had been festering since about and finally a rival movement of international prestige splintered offf the killens group remained inside amsac and afna came on the scene in conjunction with the emergence of the new young negro creative wave in new york many of these young negroes who attended the afna conference were not invited to the killens conference the uniqueness of afna its readiness to deal with negrowhite cultural fundamentals both ideologically and institutionally was indicated by the fact that the afna affair was not just a negro writers conference it attempted to deal also with painting music the philosophy of negritude literary criticism and enlisted the participation of africans interested in the negro cultural image the conference was administered and projected by the cultural independents and the young generation it was not wellattended yet was a publicrelations and institutional success representing a solid and substantial new direction its discussions and deliberations were orderly mature most of the time intelligent critical and probing and educational it foreshadowed the cultivation of a new literary and cultural critique among the younger negro creative intelligentsia by contrast the much more crowded sessions at the new school in april saw the killens literary and cultural entourage approaching the end of its yearold reign this conference was painfully frenetic and pitifully rhetorical attempting to analyze the negro writers cultural precariousness in american society and the fate of the american negro in american culture as a people here the crisis of the negro intellectual was acted out in vivid detail with truetolife players mouthing lines and speeches they had rehearsed for years all the ingroup members were there with representatives dating back to the heyday of harlems committee for negro in the arts at the new school was represented the whole left traditionfreedom newspaper harlem writers guild association of artists for freedom inc freedomways magazine american dialog with its echoes of masses and mainstream and for good measure shades of political affairsthe communist partys official theoretical organ the leftwing literary elite was in full control in a desperate bid to reestablish its status within the stream of the new cultural and literary trends the new school conference was staged in memory of the departed lorraine hansberry with the exception of the poetry panel every other panel was policed by one member or two of the harlem cultural ingroup thus the literary cultural and other opinions of killens john henrik clarke sylvester leaks alice childress sara wright william branch ossie davis and ruby dee in absentia and lorraine hansberry through her exhusband robert nemiroff dominated this writers conference james baldwin not originally a charter member of the group was nevertheless the literary lion of the performance but not in the eyes of the ranking members of the exharlem leftwing elite next in order of importance on the panels came certain whites of leftwing literary and critical fame like herbert aptheker and walter lowen fels we shall see in this writers conference how the radical left continues to wield its influence over negro writers the new york times said of the new school conference they hissed and hollered and debated one another for about seven hours yesterday sunday april and when it was all over words laterthey could not agree on much of anything but that is the way it was supposed to be free and flailing in the course of yesterdays program james baldwin was called a literary prostitute the new york times was condemned for covering harlem like a police beat and the national broadcasting company was chided for offering a talented negro playwright a job as a janitor the conference might still be going on now if the moderator allan morrison of ebony magazine had not simply stopped the show but not before he himself had been criticized by the audience both white and negrofor suggesting that perhaps some negroes are not now sufficiently qualified to take advantage of all the opportunities open to them in the creative and communications fields of movies theaters television and journalism a young woman named myrna baines called mr baldwin an extremely talented literary prostitute the truth is however that the total conference was not all chaos and confusion there were many papers readsome historically informative eloquent and pointedsome anecdotal trite rhetorical and superficial but the discussions around these various papers became emotional and intellectual bedlams several of these papers posed problems and conceptions raised questions and suggested directions which the panelists could neither debate nor pursue to any definitive conclusions the conference led the participants into unknown and unsurveyed regions of black and white cultural reality but once there killens and his faction were able to give not one modicum of intellectual or programmatic leadership the problems of negro writers in terms of craft content and opportunities integrated jobs in the cultural media have been taken up over and over again but these are individual problems when the real substance of what negro writers are dealing with but cant pursue is the group cultural status of the american negro ethnic group the future individual status of the negro writer is predicated on this group cultural status if the two sides of this question are separated the negro writer continues to be what he always wasa craftsman taking his chances as an individual running after whatever support and patronage he can get wherever he can find it even in the communist partyand often selling out what principles he has if any to maintain himself the harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite did precisely this they were all launched as writers by the political leftwing which gave them patronage and support in harlem and beyond through leftwing connections in publishing theater and the broadcasting media some of them actually got more support than their individual talents really merited they were awarded prizes and jobs profitable marriages and social contacts which furthered their careers now they come before the public in writers conferences pretending to be leaders in intellectualcreative thought who are going to advance the negro movementpurely on the strength of the dubious example of their own selfadvancement the emptiness of these pretensions was soon revealed when conference panelists demanded to know where do you go from here what is your plan do you have a new program killens literary faction had no answers when a conferee demanded i want to know how are you going to get this cultural message to enough people to make it effective when most of the people dont read novels what other forms are you planning on using killens answered i would like to redirect the question and ask the whole audience what are you doing because when we write you know it is going to be up to you to help us get to you it is quite a bit to ask the negro writer to write this thing and figure out how it is going to get to you i think this little exchange between negro writer and audience shows clearly why writers conferences are worthless another participant asserted i would like to suggest that the novel is a useless form of art for the urgency of the problem confronting the negro americans specifically and in my own particular case the problems confronting me most important is my urgent desire for freedom first of all end the novel all these people on the panel were talking about the directness that a person should have this young lady novelist said she was not interested in writing a novel about the bourgeoisie in her society she was interested in writing a novel about the poor man unfortunately you are not a poor man but there are some negro writers in america whom this conference has entirely overlooked one of whom spoke in this auditorium at ten oclock this morning saying that i came here to destroy western civilization in effect not to let a ford be a car that i build new parts on to make a jet plane but to offer a jet plane that is different than the thing itself i am talking about poetry and the directness of the people who are in the streets of selma or all over the south and the young people whoi dont know whatbut it is certainly more complicated than sitting for two years at the typewriter and knowing something about a family unit john o killens had no response to this and sylvester leaks the chairman of this panel said all right we accept your statement ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming we must adjourn now roughly thirtyfive negroes in the literary arts the media and the press including the leftwing elite members took part in the conference added to these were several white writers and critics of the negroes interestingly enough there were only seven at the new school conference who had participated in the afna conference in february they were writer and critic wilmer lucas poets samuel allen calvin hernton and gloria oden and playwrights william branch loften mitchell and ossie davis of these seven only samuel allen had figured personally in the amsacafna split as one of the leading founders of amsac and as the only ranking amsac spokesman who did not boycott the afna conference various other writers who had participated in the afna conference either were not invited or did not appear as panelists at the new school conference what is happening here in all this tentative crossing of lines sorting eliminating and jockeying is that the decline of amsac and the emergence of afna has left killens faction without the influential base it once had within amsac these conferences actually reflect an incipient cultural power struggle within the new york representatives of the negro creative intelligentsia involved in this burgeoning struggle are several factions the literary and cultural left the literary and cultural nationalists the oldguard and the new the unaffiliated negro literary establishment in the universities and certain negro publications behind these lie the crucial issues of africa and the afroamerican image in the arts at the very root of the problem are philosophic and cultural implications of negritude as propounded by the society of african culture in paris and africa interestingly enough while the afna conference had a panel discussion on negritude the new school conference did not at the final session of this latter conference dr john everett president of the new school said of the affair in some ways i have been dismayed by it and in some ways greatly heartened i am dismayed by the fact that the white intellectual community obviously does not know of nor does it have any real comprehension of the vitality and the true strength of the negro intellectual community this has been for me consequently a dismaying experience the dialogue that should be going on between the white intellectual community and the negro intellectual community obviously has not been going on it is one of the functions of the new school to see that this dialogue proceeds and continues the good president had ample reason to be dismayed but he is no doubt a liberal and was being quite kind and maybe even sanguine yet most of what happened at the new school was not a dialogue but a frustrated diatribe a dialogue demands a cultural methodology that these negro writers do not have and that the whites cannot give them a cultural methodology must be predicated on a broad grasp of the totality of cultural factors in life which these writers have never possessed for dr everett to suggest a continued dialogue between negro and white intellectuals means that such a dialogue must proceed on one and the same level with both whites and the negro community however killens group was already blocked from this kind of dialogue by the very presence of the apthekerleft and the ideology it represents the new school conference could not separate literary art as content theme and form from the material basis of cultural expression ie the organizational and administrative nature of the cultural apparatus which has to be treated separately to indulge in analogy these conference writers behave like a bunch of defenders of morality protesting a certain residence being used as a whorehouse instead of a sunday school when the residence is owned operated and built by a professional madam such a situation would suggest a twosided strategyhold the sunday school elsewhere and in the meantime wage a fight by any means possible to oust the madam from ownership of the residence but these conference writers want to hold their sunday school in the madams house while the girls are working on other days besides sunday a whorehouse by any other name is still a whorehouseeven if it is integrated thus these conference writers want to join the prevailing cultural superstructure of america while protesting its standards and values under the misapprehension that the injection of their values whatever they are alleged to be can change that superstructure this is ridiculous no one can hope to change americas cultural standards and values unless the proprietorship the administration and the uses to which the cultural apparatus are put are changed to allow for more democratic social control it is only on this basis that there can be any dialogue between the negro and the white intellectual and it is only along this methodical route that the white intellectual can be prodded and challenged into taking a stand on social change the white intellectual will never take this position on his own because there will always be some establishment posture and privilege he will want to defend be it anglosaxon supremacy the jewish intellectual mystique or the assimilationist worship of the wasp ideal in the cultural arts that there are some blacks participating in this latter category can certainly be deemed a source of ideological confusion for all concerned this very schizoid ambivalence is what befogs the clique consciousness of the writers who staged the new school conference most aptly this conference was dedicated to the memory of the late lorraine hansberry for indeed ideologically she was the groups inspiration and her literary and aesthetic ideals are theirs consequently not a mumbling word that smacks of criticism of hansberrys work will ever come from this group for that would be tantamount to criticizing themselves they could never admit that thev have been accepted by different establishments mostly on the basis of inferior work or that they are talking out of both sides of the mouth projecting the afroamerican image in literature as negro writers today and tomorrow switching images a la hansberrys brustein yet swearing that they are still projecting the black image just as if everybody were truly colorblind sylvester leaks opened his panel discussion with a paper titled the failure of the black writer a most brave and intrepid declaration considering who was listening and watching he then proceeded to criticize not a single negro writer by namepresent or absent the topic of the panel was what negro novelists are saying however the first person to speak on this panel was lorraine hansberrys husband robert nemiroff not previously listed on the panel of six nemiroffs only reference to the subject at handnegro novelistswas that his late wife had started a novel that would not be published this panel opening up the dam of confusion seemed to establish an approach designed to forestall any threat of serious criticism of any literary ingroup member hence with the exception of the blasts at ellison and baldwin nothing emerged but bland critical platitudes and impersonal generalizations at one point killens delivered his prepared assault on ellison herbert hill newly blossoming literary expert on negro affairs acclaimed ralph ellison for all the wrong reasons because ellisons work according to mr hill transcends the traditional occupation of the negro writer well now mr hill aside from the insufferable paternalistic arrogance of this statement let us take up this question of the mainstream and face the fact that it contains some rather sickly fish from top to bottom killens obviously thinks the literary mainstream rather polluted unless one of course enters either from the left or from the urbanite at the time of freedom newspaper however the word mainstream had not come into vogue rather it was negrowhite unity plus socialist realism john henrik clarke also got in his blows at ellison i particularly wanted to take up with mr hill this continued love affair with ralph ellison who is standing outside of his peoples struggle making olympian remarks about how that struggle should be conducted hill who is the naacps labor secretary replied i would categorically deny that by the way i am sorry that we dont have a chance to discuss mr ellisons work i would simply challenge that point of view clarke i hope mr hill can be brief with this exaggeration of the role of ralph ellison who has spent so much time in the last years in flight from his own people and has not even answered most mail addressed to him by his fellow black writers and has said positively that art and literature are not racial he wont come into any afroamerican writers conference i think ellison wrote one very interesting thing from the point of view of craftsmanship it was a very good and powerful work whether ralph ellison will follow up whether ralph ellison has grown up is open to question in many quarters starting with me let me say that i do not see how any intelligent person not committed to a previous bias can read invisible man and affirm that mrellison stands aside from the struggle for racial justice in the united states i am not authorized to speak for mr ellison he speaks very well for himself enter herbert aptheker i just wanted to say that i assume mr clarke has read ralph ellisons book and probably many in the audience have and i have also the invisible man was done about years ago clarke nineteen fiftytwo aptheker it is unfortunate that mr ellison is not here i would say that his work since the invisible man even though he is not here and i prefer not to talk that way in his absence but in terms of what he has published and also his published assertions he has made himself rather not particularly visible in the struggles of the negro people clarke i want to take the qualification further than that i think dr aptheker put it correctly i was referring to the last years and the last years when baldwin took flight and went to paris hating himself and his people literally but did come back and enter the mainstream of the struggle whether he is psychologically back home completely opens maybe a question but at least he knows the road that leads to home but mr ralph ellison seems to have been going further away from home in that sense we can see now that the killens group in a precarious situation these days cannot attack ellison on craftsmanship or even content any more as killens did on freedom newspaper because none of them has written anything even remotely comparable to ellisons achievements hence they must assail him on the question of participation in the struggle and the fact that ellison once stated that art and literature are not racial but clarke forgets that lorraine hansberry their great mentor said precisely the same thingraisin was not racial it was not a negro play it was about americans at the writers conference sponsored by kittens group and amsac lorraine hansberrys paper was not about negro writers problems but about the decadence of such white writers as tennessee williams and others nobody protested that her remarks were not racial nothing was said until after this conference when hansberry scandalized the leading lights of the harlem writers guild by declaring that negro writers are retarded that raised some ire however even if ellison did express the view that literature and art are not racial as clarke insists the evidence remains that all of ellisons work as exemplified in invisible man and shadow and act is definitely racial i would rather believe that ellison expressed this view in when he refused to attend the amsac conference in order to avoid being involved with kittens whose freedom newspaper review of invisible man ellison had every right to resent on more than political grounds moreover ellison never went as far as miss hansberry did to show all concerned that she truly believed literature and art were not racial the literary leftwing has always functioned on the principle that some negro writers are more privileged than others but there is much more behind this clarkekillens attack on ellison than comes out kittens has a personal literary stake in all this which clarke does not moreover kittens leftwing background precedes that of clarke by several years the truth is that the racial leftwing will never forgive ellison for writing invisible man no matter what ellison does or does not do about the struggle thus for clarke to chide ellison for refusing to attend any afroamerican writers conference is naive in the extremeespecially conferences run by all the leftwings favored negro writers with political axes to grind in the presence of the leading white communist party theoretician and historian on the negro moreover there would be little value in ellisons attending a killensled conference unless permitted to discuss socialist realism and negro writing on the left but there are no pasternaks among these leftwingsponsored negro writers thus in both kittens and julian mayfield refused to allow a debate at the amsac conference on the influence of socialist realism on the freedom of negro writers since ellisons writing career on the left precedes that of kittens ellison knows much better than clarke what happens to negro writers on the left who refuse to submit themselves to the standards of socialist realism clarke who is not really a creative writer never had to cope with this question ralph ellison does not owe the left anything since the left did not make him as a writer hence ellison is not morally obligated to support any struggle or any negro writers conferences initiated by the left let the leftwing writers clique in the harlem writers guild get their own house in order and beamed in on reality they have no right to demand that other writers fall in line behind them because the struggle is larger and broader than they are with more ramifications and complexities than their limited imaginations can encompass let them remember that there are still writers functioning today who long ago assumed their writers prerogative to tell the radical left you people do not understand the black peoples dilemma in the united states what has happened to those writers but note how obediently john henrik clarke the africanistafroamerican nationalist mouths every twisted hypocritical ambivalence of the leftwing integrationists in killens group hill was right when he intimated clarke was critically moved by a previous bias in the same killens crew decided that frank yerby was no longer to be considered a negro writer having joined wright baldwin etc in paris to rewrite new versions of the foxes of harrow that got whiter and whiter would clarke put ellison in yerbys category he would but clarke ought to go back to the may issue of urbanite and read the last paragraph of lorraine hansberrys article there he will see that in her mind frank yerby was in the same category with charles white leontyne price lena horne harry belafonte james baldwin john killens nina simone paul robeson langston hughes julian mayfield odetta p j sydney eartha kitt and pearl bailey they were in her words a band of angels hurling forth the art of twenty millions well this was miss hansberrys opinion and clarke should take note of the multicolored witches brew of ethnic imagery comprising this list of candidates for high honors in the field of racial identity john henrik clarke is to be respected for one thinghe has never equivocated on his pride in being black and africanesque today however it seems clarke has been placed in a most awkward and degrading ideological position he has to defend and play secondfiddle to certain johnnycomelatelys whose black pride in literature and art is turned at will according to its cultural marketability instead of attacking ralph ellison clarke should have been asking for some clarification from herbert aptheker as to what aptheker meant by this statement thus the components of what veblen saw in the intellectual preeminence of european jews and what ashley montague saw in the natural superiority of women and what karl marx saw as the saving quality of those who labor all are present in the american negro men and women one does not have to move from these opinions to perverse distortions leading off into insidious nationalism but one should see in these opinions additional suggestions towards understanding the centrality of the negro question notice that aptheker did not ascribe natural superiority to the working class but only a saving quality no longer even a revolutionary quality however apthekers paper propounded what he calls the superiority of the american negro in the abstract mass concept aptheker used to view the negro people across historical vistas as a beautiful untarnished and noble folk struggling for equality these were the ingredients of that peculiar genre of leftwing romanticism in negro history writing that historical stream continued unbroken from nat turner and denmark vesey to sojourner truth from john brown and frederick douglass to w e b dubois and herbert aptheker and ultimately to the communist party but this abstract mass concept was applicable only to apthekers brand of writingso easily translated into dogma to most negroes in the flesh he was quite arrogant today this peculiarly inverted racial attitude holds the negro superior a patronization carried to its ultimate dogmatic degree for political purposes for a black muslim to say this doubtless would bring from aptheker the charge of reactionary race chauvinism similar to his own attitudes to the garvey movement the new school conference was valuable in that it demonstrated clearly the limitations of a conference composed only of writers rather than practitioners of all the arts this conference revealed that negro writers are struggling under severe illusions intellectual handicaps and many societal and cultural misapprehensions about reality as david boroff pointed out whether intentionally or inadvertently the negro writer is up against the real ascendancy of the jewish writer and artist in a country of white anglosaxon protestant dominance in every field but the creative and cultural for david boroff to admit that the white anglosaxon creative impulse is just about dead might be news to some of killens group but in truth it has been on the wane ever since its last spurt in the s since that time jewish writers and artists have not only filled that particular creative void they have also preempted a considerable portion of negro thematic material both in literature and in the field of social science studies during the s when the anglosaxon creative artist was still fecund and original there was much anglosaxonjewish collaboration especially in the theater the late lorraine hansberry condemned the stereotypes of a porgy and bess far more significant is the fact that this great symbol of the negros secondclass status in the cultural arts was a product of jewish and anglosaxon collaboration civilwriters however like lorraine hansberry will be very careful to limit their charges of literary paternalism to writers like the frenchman jean genet far removed from the home ground where native wasps and jews have been battening off the folk for decades both in literature and music as a play the blacks does not touch the heart of the american cultural problem moreover it is in a class by itself as theatrical literature in terms of its newer quality and form it shows up writers of the level of the killens group as rather pedestrian parochial uninspired unimaginative latecomers to the s tradition of protest and pure realism now when baldwin killens hansberry and others have finally caught up with the s the jewish writers are doing something else hence the killens group stands helpless albeit vocal before a situation in american culture whose historical derivatives they do not comprehend yet they themselves unwittingly played certain purblind roles in the recent history of this cultural development no one can much blame negro writers for drifting leftward in culture and politics at some point in their individual careers but once they do too many either become captives for the balance of their intellectual lives or else are ultimately disillusioned if not expelled and drift into a negative kind of isolation or exile few of them ever seem to learn anything positive about reality from this experience the radical left of the s and s was not a movement of anglosaxons or their ideology it was an ethnic movement dominated by negroes and jews and it was the jews who ideologically influenced the negroes thus the radical left in america has developed in such a way that the jewish ethnic group one of the smallest in the country had more political prestige wielded more theoretical and organizational power than the negro who in fact represented the largest ethnic minority consequently all political and cultural standards on the radical left were in the main established and enforced by jews for and on negroes this negrojewish state of affairs was paralleled outside the radical left as well in the civil_rights organizations one can explain this development rationalize it excuse it condemn it or uphold it call it negative or positive but the fact remains that it was ethnically undemocratic more important it has retarded and smothered the negros intellectual and political development on the cultural front it has prevented negro writers and artists from grappling in a creative fashion with the underdeveloped cultural status of the negro within a multicultural and multiethnic society the negro has been boxed in politically economically and culturally he has been unable to improvise on another groups standards and rules of playing the game on the other hand many negroes have developed their own brand of laissezfaire acquiescence to the status quo these writers did not realize they were limiting the range and the scope of their own talents so bent were they on making it nor did they see through the cultural ruse being perpetrated on them and the cultural paternalism and control exercised behind that ruse herbert apthekers tumultuous praise for william branchs play in splendid error in masses and mainstream went unchallenged no one would admit that it was actually a bad play that happened to be about john brown and frederick douglass thus praiseworthy as an historical civil_rightsprotest play leftwing jewish writers however were not writing this kind of a play one of the big theatrical hits of the time was the world of sholem aleichem a dramatization of the jewish folk writers stories and certainly no protest play the killens group were very impressed with this example of creative jewish theater artmainly because ruby dee was given a white role to play as an integrated casting giftthis was the great achievement john o killens summing up of the new school conference was an exercise in literary and cultural doubletalk he took no stand on a single question of literary principle simply paying lip service to all points of view on that intangible called universality while killens did not openly say he favored the blackoutsidewhiteinside literary school or the i am just a writer who happens to be a negro stance of james baldwin and others he did make the following revealing comments but most of the writers that were here this weekend seemed to be askingdoes art have any nobler purposehas art ever had any nobler purpose the question kept being raised on the platform and from the audience and it reminded me of sidney brustein and the sign in sidney brusteins window the question how the how is important i should say the how is damned important how do we reach the ears of the negro people of our country note the flicker of the twinimage the negrojewish identityexchange motif of the hansberry dramatic saga referred to by one who has always maintained that he was never in doubt as to who he is and what he is as a writer i am a negro writer said killens and my materials are basically the negro people but after all is said and done killens must still peer from the outside into sidney brusteins window to find out how to reach the ears of the negro people the new school writers conference demonstrated without a doubt that the former harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite are possessed of an intellectual literary and creative ethnic duality they refuse to admit taken as a whole they are neither white black nor jewish but an amalgam of all three unless the negro creative intellectuals as a stratum can evolve creative and artistic policies that will govern cultural programs organizations and selfsustained and administered research institutions they cannot achieve cultural democracy against the competitions of white andor jewish intelligentsia america today is a cultural desert strewn with the corpses of commercialized commodityart where sweet voices sing lullabies of cultural degeneration its aesthetics are antilife its images those of lunacy and the propaganda of destruction in america the political power and economic status of the white anglosaxon are considered ample compensation for the nations lack of cultural prestige imposed on it by wasp rule in this void the jew has played a manysided role as the ethnic middleman of culture whereas the negro has been a mere commodity on the cultural market to be bought out sold short sold out or else frozen out this situation cannot long endure if this nation is to haul itself out of its own internal mire and rehabilitate its image in the eyes of the world the negro creative intellectual has a potentially powerful role to play in this process if he can master a literary and cultural critique reorientation which it is doubtful the oldguard negro writers of the new school writers conference can achieve new younger more willing and imaginative creative forces are needed back in wallace thurman wrote a novel in which he satirized the negro artists and writers of the s negro renaissance one of the characters complained that the average negro intellectual and artist has no goal no standards no elasticity no pregnant germ plasm after praising only one negro artist of that time who had the elements of greatness the character observed again the rest of us are mere journeymen planting seed for someone else to harvest we all get sidetracked sooner or later the older ones become warped by propaganda we younger ones are mired in decadence none of us seem to be able to rise above our environment wallace thurman called his novel infants of the spring yet in over years the negro writers of the new school conference the former harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite have not really advanced much further than the negro renaissance writers in terms of ideas if the s negro writers were infants of the spring the present elite are adolescents of the long hot summer they are intellectuals in a crisis but a crisis occasioned not merely by an inherited backlog of unresolved history but by the fact that they are not truly intellectuals by any historical and cultural definition this is one mans reaction to a damn good book harlem is a very expensive piece of real estate bounded on the east by the east river and on the west by the hudson river and on the north by white folks and on the south by white folks it is many things to many people it is the neighborhood el barrio to some it is the jungle to so many others it is moreover a colony on the mainland of the mother country and the country is a mother right the last of the great white mothers stepmother dig it down these mean streets alfred knopf is a book about the neighborhood an autobiography a couple of years back my son wrote to me dad as walk through the negro neighborhood i suddenly realize that the negro ghetto is not a ghetto it is home it was a revelation that shook me to my hominy grits langston hughes of course knew it all along he never bought the jungle bit to the great man it was home sweet home bitter home loften mitchell always knew it but white men designated it as the jungle and the jungle it was to many black folks conservatives and radicals and all the variations in between moderates liberals militants many of whom lived in the neighborhood all of their lives unharmed physically but were scared to be out after dark because the man had called their home the jungle dig called it the jungle thereby creating the image of a place where only beasts and savages abided save for a few courageous white men missionaries mercenaries and such who ventured into the jungle at their own peril to christianize the savages and bring them progress and glad tidings of the wondrous blessings of civilization according to the script the priest the explorer the merchant were the good guys always and forever repeat if the man says it is the jungle then of course it must be the jungle existing only to be exploited for its raw materials its people but comes the native insurrection when the costs of exploitation become prohibitive then the jungle must be destroyed along with the beasts and savages who dwell therein and most of the great stories depicting the jungle written sometimes even by black would you believe colored writers have been in essence all about how i lived through my jungle days and made my escape to civilization and transcended my cultural deprivation and wrote a best seller about it meaning if i did why not you why not every man down these mean streets is an autobiography written by piri thomas a black puerto rican who looked upon east harlem not as jungle but as el barrio the neighborhood his neighborhood home not a ghetto but home he was not always a black puerto rican that is what the core of his story is about one mans lonely journey to his blackness it is moreover because he possessed the artistry to make it so the universal story of the manofcolors journey to his selfhood his identity piri thomass parents were of course from puerto rico his mother was visibly white but was blacker in her psyche than his father who was black visibly but who was for the most part in full flight from his blackness piri was the oldest child in a family of seven children the oldest and the blackest and thereby hangs a significant aspect of his journey to identity through most of his young life he loved his father even though he felt a sharp rejection from him much of which he attributed to his and his fathershigh degree of visibility poverty alienation disenchant ment gang rumbles love discrimination sex dope addiction robberiespiri thomas journeyed down many and varied mean streets in a searchofdesperation for his manhood selfhood most of these mean streets turned out to be escape hatches ephemeral as a tornado and equally as devastating elusive as a willowisp some were deadends pure and simple there was a stint in the merchant marines an abortive stickup in a downtown manhattan nightclub a sixyears stretch in prison all the beautiful ugliness of life is within these pages down these mean streets piri was a man in motion in a perpetual state of war against the formidable windmills of establishment and these mean streets do not stop at central park they go with piri and his black and afroamerican brother all the way to galveston texas where he does a thing in a white hotel with a white whore who thinks she is making it with a spanish cat then i stepped in front of the mirror and put my jacket on the broad was still on the bed wondering if i was going to make her again when walked to the door she smiled and said in broken texas spanish did i like it and did i want more i opened the door and said baby i just want you to knowand i watched her smile fall off and a look of horror fill the empty space it lefti just want you to know i repeated that you just got laid by a nigger by a black man and i didnt wait to hear her gasp or to watch her jump out of the bed i ran i disappeared because i learned a long time ago to hit and run right back to the turf and my turf was that goddamn ship the characters in this book are many and varied fleshandblood and nittygritty people the language is real and fresh and true for the most part it is a gutsy idiomatic blending of puerto rican and afroamericanese dig it mean streets has a terrible beauty a work of art it is a fine job of writing feeling living moreover it is a book that breaks with the tradition of most books written about harlem about all the harlems of the usa harlem is not the ghetto in this book for ghetto is yet another european word formulated out of contempt for the inhabitants of the ghetto in the american context it is another word for jungle in the good old usa it means that any neighborhood inhabited solely by black men is ipso facto an inferior place too many black folk have bought this view this definition of every black community this image of the black mans capacity for nationhood for neighborhood if you will for black community hood having accepted this negative view of blackness and black potential this for many middle class black folks has meant a lifetime of running away from self and selfhood it is time far past time brothers and sisters to stop running and come on home come on home and affirm your dignity and your manhood here they are no place else but here with us security for black folks even middle class black folks is rooted in el barrio in unity with the black masses supreme court appointments appointed mayors of washington etc notwithstanding your true strength must come from us from blackness all else are mere tokens of ol massas affection and whatever of massa giveth he can damn sure take away bless him so come on back home to the turf the neighborhood and help to make it all of these mean streets a fitter place for human habitation this was brother malcolms vision this is the last clear chance for your salvation come on home brothers and sisters and let us together take charge of our community and rid it of the lecherous gringos and we will create our own definitions of ourselves and our communities we will designate them all anew is wherever black men live the ghetto or is it the neighborhood the turf home what is the word in afroamericanese for el barrio come let us reconstruct the neighborhood in our own black image weve often wondered in the dim caves of our jealous heart just how fair it is to ask a trying to be writer to give an appraisal of a first published effort by a real writer would the fangs of hurt sink so deeply that a wounded animal would shriek its pain across the page called looked for spelling errorsfaults in book review its very important to consider the source before accepting the word and we would like to assure the reader that if we could have found fault with the flagellants farrar straus giroux we would have we read it twicewe sentence structureanything we were so upset by not finding anything that we read it again for its hate content it is small and the print is such that our weak eyes sent a sighful prayer to the black madonna for realizing that colored people like big print and warming the white mans heart to make him give it to us there are two minor white women in the story of ideal and jimson and we looked and looked to see if miss polite had been unduly prejudiced again we must report that she was fair much nicer than perhaps we would have been had they messed with us like they messed with ideal then we went to jimsonand we believed every black woman has had her jimsonto see if he was treated with the proper respect due a black uncastrated man jimson was not as fully developed as he could have been but he was as fully developed as he should have been for miss polite takes both the black man and the black woman to their naked selves beyond even the black skin all the way down she takes us into the black bones with all unnecessary organs removed down into back bones with only black hearts raw nerve endings a black thimble inside the skull holding the required responses and the black organ that is a delicacy in southern states presented only after an involved ceremony to the purest and truest of southern ladies she puts these to us in her novel and it hurts not because she creates sympathy it is too late for either to deal with sympathy not because she creates guilt guilt has no meaning for black people but because it is so near a truth we hope it is not the truth for if the black man and the black woman must leave each other to be happy and fulfilled people then we are damning untold generations to hopelessness and we would not deny a truth because it hurts but we cannot accept the separation of the only true human beings as the answer to their and our salvation nor would we force a unity of black delicacy with black hallow just for the sake of unity anything for anythings sake is nothingness and in the process of natural selection a panther may play in a field of sheep he may run and jump and do many delightful things but when the dinner bell sounds and the hunt begins he will join the other panthers in making a meal of the ewe and the ram who objects will be put in his place miss polites novel is excellent reading her style is very definitely her own and the style is a part of the story telling there are dreams and images and feelings that all merge and flow with back flashes to her past and forebodings about the future it becomes clear to ideal that she is being abused not because jimson doesnt work isnt a poet or a man but because he no longer loves her and will not allow her to go at a point of happiness he cuts the fruit from the vine at its overripe state and forces ideal to drool for the sweet juices that once were hers while watching the maggots fornicate on it and multiply neither ideal nor jimson is strong nor are they weak they are simply one black man and one black woman trying to find the sweet black life it was denied ideal and jimson it need not be denied us all the flaggelants describes beautifully a relationship in a given period it may well become one of the major novels of the sixties it is an enlightenment and we heartily recommend it we would like to remind our readers that we give this praise under the strong protest that we didnt write itnikki giovanni somebody on the ins side said once that i g politics is the art of the possible but for saemsm the ack outsider in america politics in america has been the art of the impossible it has been the art of the impossible because it has been the art of trying to make a fundamental change in a political system by using the structures and instruments that were designed to perpetuate that system it has been the art of the impossible because it has been the art of trying to make a social revolution with moderate tools that were invented to prevent social revolutions it has been the art of the impossible because of the nature of politics which is the art of making some things impossible for outsiders and because of the extremity of the black mans situation which cannot be changed unless all things are made possible because of the black mans situation which is radical by any definition and because of the nature of american politics which is moderate to conservative by any definition the black man in america has been condemned to seek radical ends within a political framework which was designed to prevent sudden and radical social and economic changes for almost years now the black outsiders of america have been squirming within the halters of this maddening dilemma during this period the representatives of the outsiders in the councils of the insiders have made striking gains as individuals but black people as a group have not been able to change their status and their social and economic conditions with political instruments and the question we must grapple with now is whether it will ever be possible to achieve fundamental social and economic change by the practice of politics as defined by the insiders the question nowand the question is radical because the times are radical and because our situation is radicalis whether politics is relevant to our contemporary crisis which cannot be resolved without political programs of a depth and dimension never before attempted in america is the old politicsthe politics of deals and trades and patronage the politics of place and privilege and individual advancementis the old politics relevant to the issues of bread for the millions and housing and education for the poor is politics relevant to the question of the redistribution of income and resources and the restructuring of the fundamental institutions of this society is politics relevant to black reality beyond all that beyond the specific problems of black people we must ask whether politics is relevant to white people is it relevant to the emptiness and hysteria and the unresolved social and economic problems in the white community can the old politics create white individuals who will not need racial scapegoats to solve their social and economic and sexual anxieties watts and newark and detroit put these questions on the agenda of american life in a very real sense these rebellions were devastating critiques of the american way of politics in rebellion the black people of america said that they were voting more and enjoying it less in rebellion the black people of america said that politics in america has failed them and that it is necessary now to create a new politics that can address itself to the real problems of this profoundly racist society it is against this background that we must view the question of the black mans role in american politics and in the light of these events and the history these events reflect we must say frankly that black people have no role in american politics black people are the outsiders the disinherited of the american political system as human beings they live outside white america in numerous black colonies and as voters and political persons they inhabit the margins on the periphery of the system even the persons who represent these outsiders in the councils of the insiders occupy a marginal positionas the adam powell and the thomas dodd cases indicated from time to time the inhabitants of these black colonies have played crucial roles as pawns of persons inside the system more significantly they have crucially affected the system by their presence on the periphery in other words they have acted on the system from a distance indeed one might say that the political history of america is a series of approaches and withdrawals from the pressing reality of the black outsiders on the margin in summation then the role of the black man outside american politics is the dual role of a political pawn for insiders and a protagonist from the outside of the whole political system in considering this dual role we have to deal with what j d b miller the political theorist calls the politics of the center and the circumference we have to deal in other words with a wwcolonial relation as kenneth clark noted in his book dark ghetto the dark ghettos are social political educational andabove alleconomic colonies their inhabitants are subject people victims of the greed cruelty insensitivity guilt and fear of their masters these colonies are controlled politically from the outside ultimate policymaking power lies in the hands of aliens who have their own representatives many of them black on the spot with power to see that the will of the white center is obeyed in the black circumference we must note also that the inhabitants of the center and the inhabitants of the circumference do not deal with each other directly black people and white people as gunnar myrdal noted deal with each other like two foreign countries through the medium of plenipotentiaries i say this with bluntness to emphasize the fact that when we talk about black politics we are not talking about ordinary politics and we are not talking about ordinary politics because the american political system has not created a single social community in which the reciprocal rules of politics would apply conventional politics cannot solve this problem because conventional politics is a part of the problem it is a part of the problem in the sense that the political system is the major bulwark of racism in america it is a part of the problem in the sense that the political system is structured to repel fundamental social and economic change we hear a great deal about the deficiencies real or imagined of certain black leaders but not enough attention it seems to me is paid to the framework within which they operate that framework prevents radical growth and innovationand it was designed to prevent radical growth and innovation what we have to deal with here is what arthur schlesinger jr called the paradox of power the fact that power within the system is necessary to do certain things but that power within the system makes it impossible to do most things when john f kennedy became president he was no political novice but he didnt realize schlesigner tells us how beautifully the government structure was organized to prevent anything from happening from the very beginning the american political structure has been beautifully organized to keep anything from happening we need not deal here with the theory that the constitutional convention was a conspiracy against the revolutionary ideals of the declaration of independence but it is obvious from a cursory examination of that document that the founding fathers were animated by a desire to protect property and privilege from sudden social experiments the theory of checks and balances for example is based on the theory that privilege must be protected from people thomas jefferson a large and wealthy slaveowner protested against the antipeople biases of the new government but he did not prevail and additional safeguards were later built into the system to protect the rising in dustrial directorate one of these safeguards of course was the twoparty system which was designed in part to filter out radicalism and to force dissent to express itself within two moderate channels insofar as the black man is concerned one can say of the two parties what a political insider said to lord bryce they are like two bottles of the same size the same color and the same shape with the same labelboth of them empty the criticisms i make here of politics in america could be extended to most political structures certainly of most political structures in the west governments cannot operate without support which means in practice that they must identify with certain interests in society and this means in america that government has usually identified with the interests of white people nothing illustrates this better than the central events in the political history of the negro contrary to the generally accepted idea that history began not in slavery but in indentured servitude the first black immigrants in english america landed at jamestown in august they came these first black men and women the same way many perhaps most of the first white men cameunder duress and compulsion they found a system which permitted poor people to pay for their passage by working a stipulated number of years as indentured servants in virginia then and in other colonies the first black immigrants fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic groove which carried with it no implications of racial inferiority during this transitional period of years or more a period of primary importance in the history of america the first black immigrants mingled with whites on a basis of substantial equality black and whites worked in the same fields lived in the same huts and fraternized in the same places some perhaps most of the first black immigrants worked out their term of indentured servitude and were freed within a short time they were accumulating property pounds and indentured servants the record indicates that these black settlers were accorded substantially the same rights as freed whites they voted in eleven of the thirteen original colonies and some of them became the first black officeholders in america by filling the minor posts of beadle and surety all this changed dramatically with the opening of the new world and the introduction of sugar planting in the west indies this new situation created a demand for men that could not be satisfied by the casual kidnapping of poor blacks in africa and poor whites in europe beginning around the leading men of the colonies passed laws that made black people servants for life this was a fatal and perhaps irreparable break in the sense of community between black and white americans it was the starting point the first turn on the road to the summer of and the dangers beyond this ominous decision was later made a part of the charter of america at the constitutional convention where northern delegates gave in to southern threats and wrote slavery into the constitution within a few years slavery had become a cancer in the heart of the american political system with incalculable results that are still re sounding in the streets of america today during the whole of the slave period black people had no political history in the narrow sense of the term political but it is impossible to understand the political history of that period without reference to the black man although black men were disfranchised in both the north and south black people voted in every election influencing the political process by their presence and by the cause they embodied some black people voted with their feet by escaping in the tens of thousands from the south others acted on the political process as nonviolent abolitionist demonstrators it is a matter of record that great black abolitionists like frederick douglass and henry highland garent participated in the founding of the liberty and free soil parties both of which were forerunners of the republican party still another form of political action for the slaves was violence as evidenced by the nat turner rebellion of when all these currents linked up with that great american agitator yankee selfinterest the stage was set for the civil war emancipation and reconstruction it was during this period that black people came onstage and spoke lines in their own name for the first time and it was during this period that the seeds were sown for the political crisis of today the period began with a promising political revolution largely as a result of the radical political vision of two republican leaders representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senator charles sumner of massachusetts the freedmen were enfranchised and federal troops were sent into the south to protect them in the exercise of the fundamental rights of american citizens with the passage of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and a civil_rights act which was a great deal stronger than the act passed in reconstruction came to a legal climax but this legislation so similar to the legislation of our day only touched the surface of the problem no one knew this better than the freedmen who saw clearly that it was necessary to complete the political revolution by a social revolution and what this meant in the context of that day was forty acres and a mule thaddeus stevens an old white man from pennsylvania who was the most powerful politician in washington and who was perhaps the most relevant politician in the political history of black americans made a valiant effort to give the radical reconstruction program the economic thrust it lacked but he was thwarted by the paradox of power after repeated attempts to push a radical land reform bill through congress stevens announced that the dream was stillborn he had fondly dreamed he said in a house speech that when any fortunate chance should have broken up for a while the foundations of our institutions and released us from obligations the most tyrannical that ever man imposed in the name of freedom that american institutions would have been so remodeled as to have freed them from every vestige of human oppression of inequality of rights or recognized degradation of the poor and the superior caste of the rich but alas he said bowing to the inherent limitations of the system this bright dream has vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision the failure of that dreamthe refusal of the political leaders of america to ground political freedom on economic freedom doomed reconstruction and paved the way to our present crisis before the curtain that lifted for a moment dropped black men and their white allies carried the south and the black man to heights of democracy that have not yet been equalled in this republic during the heyday of reconstruction from to black men served in the legislature of every southern state and in south carolina during this period black men had a majority in the legislature in every session save one black people also sent representatives to the house of representatives and two black men were elected to the u s senate from the state of mississippi there were also treasurers secretaries of state and superintendents of education in mississippi south carolina louisiana and florida and for a brief period the brilliant black politician p b s pinchback served as governor of the state of louisiana despite mistakes which were inevitable under the circumstances black people made large strides in renovating the political structures of the south people who say that black_power is simply white power in blackface ought to think long and hard about the reconstruction period black people had considerable power in south carolina mississippi louisiana where they constituted a majority of the population and a majority of the registered voters the record indicates that the black reconstruction governments gave poor and middle class white people rights aristocratic whites had denied them not only that black people in perhaps their greatest contribution created in the south what had never existed before a public school system supported by public taxation perhaps the most important development of this period was the expansion of the political horizons of black people since politics was real since it was an activity that corroborated reality and promised to change reality black people gave to politics the kind of attention their children and grandchildren would give to entertainment and religion black people lived in that faraway and mystical period in a primary relation with power they turned out in the thousands for political meetings and they followed politics day by day month by month throughout the year reconstruction was a supreme lesson the right reading of which might still mark a turning point in our history for years in this country for months men tried democracy black people and white people married each other in the southand the world did not end little black boys and little white girls went to school togetherand the confederate dead did not rise did not in fact make a sound at all although the klan said they were turning in their graves all over the south in these years blacks and whites shared streetcars restaurants hotels honors dreams the sun rose and the sun set and the constitution of the united states had some meaning from maine to mississippifor years reconstruction was a lesson first of all for black politicians it demonstrated clearly the need for bold honest and imaginative leadership and it established beyond doubt the black mans right to participate in power on the debit side it can be said that many of the black leaders of reconstruction were too anxious to prove that they could live up to the anglosaxon idea they were too anxious to prove that they could do what white politicians could do even more decisive was the failure of the black leaders of reconstruction to mobilize a black_power base and to remain in close touch with the cottonroots of their constituencies too many men then as now were living too far away from the people they said they were representing we need not concern ourselves here with the myth of corruption men used to overthrow these governments the black leaders of reconstruction were not overthrown because they were corrupt they were overthrown because they couldnt shoot in a very significant failure of the american political system the reconstruction governments were overthrown by an open and violent revolution and this open and violent revolution was legitimized by the compromise of a political bargain which gave rutherford b hayes the presidency in exchange for a suspension of constitutional safeguards which protected black voters in the south backed by every structure of power in the north the south pushed black people back towards slavery by a white terrorist campaign which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people and this campaign of terror was sanctioned by the supreme court which sucked the meaning out of the fourteenth amendment and invalidated the reconstruction civil_rights laws black people protested they organized protests and called on the president but nobody was listening and nobody really cared the democratic party was openly hostile then and there was no real alternative for black people who continued to vote republican out of habit and out of despair black people were driven from power in the south by terror and fraud but individual republicans managed to hold on to power for several years in several states and black voters sent representatives to southern legislatures and congressmen to washington until the dawn of the twentieth century as the years wore on the area of black expressiveness narrowed and by world war i it was considered subversive for black men to hold public office the violent overthrow of reconstruction set the stage for the great migration to the north which began around and continues today like the various immigrant groups black people were soon organized into political machines but these machines were composed of mutually hostile groups pursuing a politics of patronage and stalemate within the boundaries of this situation black people could veto openly hostile policies but they could not translate voting power into fundamental group gains as a result black people were penetrated by feelings of political powerlessness since politics had no relevance to their agony since it was not an activity with which they could lift themselves they began to look on it with indifference worse some black people came to see politics as a marketable activity involving the trading of votes for petty political favors for all that political involvement brought some gains at least to individuals in oscar de priest inaugurated a new era by becoming the first black congressman from the north and the first black congressman in america since the turn of the century de priest was elected as a republican from the first congressional district of chicago six years later arthur mitchell became the first democratic congressman by winning election from the same district after black politicians republican and democratic were elected to the legislatures of most northern states and the border states of kentucky and west virginia they also filled elective or appointive positions in the public service of every major city the disaster of the depression widened the political alternatives in america and with the coming of the new deal black people deserted the republican party and gave their votes and their hearts to the politics of the welfare state after world war ii and the internationalization of the race problem the political horizons of the black community widened there was a new and ominous restlessness in the black community and negro protest organizations began to mobilize mass pressures the government responded to this new mood by intervening dramatically on behalf of black americans in the fifties and sixties a series of supreme court decisions and civil_rights acts reopened the national compromise of black people began to vote again in substantial numbers in the south and in the south and north black people were named or elected to unprecedented political positions by it was possible to speak of the beginning of the second reconstruction this period of political growth brought striking gains particularly in the black middle class but the record shows that black people as a whole lost ground relative to whites in the rate of unemployment for negroes and whites to use president johnsons figures was about the same thirtyfive years later the negro rate was twice as high to continue with the figures president johnson cited in his speech at howard university in the eight per cent unemployment rate for negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites by last year the rate had grown to per cent as against per cent for whites between and the income of negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country from to the median income of negro families compared to white actually dropped from per cent to per cent since the number of white families living in poverty has decreased per cent while the number of poor nonwhite families decreased only per cent the infant mortality of nonwhites in was per cent greater than whites twentytwo years later it was per cent greater moreover the isolation of negroes from white communities is increasing rather than decreasing as negroes crowd into the central cities and become a city within a city this is a record of failure despite political success and it has led to a general crisis of confidence in the fairness of the american political system a voteless people a national fraternity used to say is a hopeless people we know now from the example of chicago and watts and detroit that a voting people can also be a hopeless people and i think it is incumbent upon all black americans in the light of this knowledge to rethink their relation to american politics i have suggested here that conventional politics is designed to prevent fundamental change i have also suggested that it is impossible to meet the fundamental needs of black people without a social revolution if these hypotheses are correctand i offer the whole history of america as evidenceit is incumbent upon us to either revitalize conventional politics or abandon conventional politics a new politics is necessary in america because the old politics has failed us and the salvation of the black man in this country and the creation of democracy in this country depend to a very great extent on the creation of a new political vision in the black community we must make a radical reevaluation of all our traditional political alliances in the light of the needs and the interests of the overwhelming majority of black people black representatives must dare now to redefine themselves in terms of the interests of their people they must ask themselves who they are and who they really represent and if their ultimate allegiance is to the black community and not to the democratic party or the republican party or labor or some white political boss they must dare to make that allegiance real by creating independent power bases in the black community at the same time black people must assume responsibility for the financing of the campaigns of black candidates they must come together as a group and provide independent bases for a new and independent politics the most urgent need of this hour is the political education of black people they must be made aware of their political and economic interests and the general nature of the opposition beyond all that it is necessary to make black people recognize their unity with others in the same situation it may be necessary for some people to operate as democrats and republicans but black people should realize that their real need is results not names the socalled alienation of the urban black voter is based i suspect on a very sophisticated analysis of the american political system black people by and large dont believe politics can bring about a realthat is to say effectivechange in their basic situation if the black masses are to rise to the requirements of this hour they must be shown that politics is their affair and in their fundamental interests bayard rustin has said that the civil_rights movement must become political i would add that the political movement must become a civil_rights movement i believe the relevant black politician must carry off the difficult feat of blending the traditional political skills with the skills of the reformer it is encouraging to note that this process is well underway in michigan for example a black mayor threatened to resign over a human rights issue and when the political process failed in wisconsin black officeholders redefined their roles and went to jail another indication of this same process was the skillful talkin staged by illinois legislators i believe it will be necessary in the future to extend this process for years white politicians have used the whole range of parliamentary weapons to deny black people human rights it is time now i think for black officeholders to use the whole range of parliamentary weapons in a nonviolent campaign within the political process this would be a service not only to black americans but also to white americans for black people embody the most advanced social and economic interests of this society and action on behalf of their interests is action also in behalf of the real interests of whites today as in black people embody the truth of the declaration of independence and the mission of the black politician is to do what white politicians have failed to do define and actualize liberty and equality as a faith and a way of life in the final analysis as emmett john hughes pointed out the art of politics is the subtle and sensitive attuning and discipling of all words and deedsnot to mend the petty conflict of the moment nor to close some tiny gap in the discourse of the daybut to define and to advance designs and policies for a thousand tomorrows and that is the historic mission of the black politician today the advancing of designs and policies for a thousand tomorrows for blacks and whites born as smoke still hovered over the rubble of the nations worst not detroits militant federation for selfdetermination at first seemed fated to help prevent future confidently its members fires proclaimed themselves part of the new black establishment this establishment included fiery black nationalist minister rev albert cleage jr bearded college radicals graysuited intellectuals and grimeyed activists from the socalled black underground and suddenly rev cleage and the others were everywhere urging black control of the black community on scores of television programs and haranguing sweaty crowds at dozens of emotional unity rallies that was last fall this past spring as gunbuying continued at an alltime high in both the suburbs and city the federation quietly expired its demise was vaguely attributed to the desire of members for new alliances and to work on individual projects actually a combination of forces had sapped the groups strength lack of financial support probably was most damaging to the federation but internal feuding clannishness and fogginess of purpose all contributed to its decline most observers here agree more significantly detroit contributed incredible rumor after incredible rumor concerning the aims of black nationalists was swallowed whole by a white community hungry for scapegoats the rumor kept alive most persistently in the suburbs was that black guerrillas planned to invade outlying areas this summer and kill the firstborn in every family but most whites were wellprepared for them it has been estimated that about onethird of suburban dwellings contain some kind of firearms and that new permits for hand guns will be issued in the metropolitan detroit area this year the white communitys generally belligerent response to the disturbance of last summer is credited with increasing the federations difficulty in obtaining needed support from white industrialists politicians and foundations and disenchantment with the liberal white establishment was apparent during the federations final cut and dried meeting the meeting had been delayed nearly two hours as the groups mostly youthful membership straggled in after huddling in little knots in the hallways rev cleage was over an hour late but once seated his face carefully blank he became the focal point of eyes it had been his dream it had not withstood the stresses from both within and without there were few moments of drama no peaks of excitement to the meeting with no particular inflection to his voice lorenzo freeman federation vicechairman stated that the board of directors after reassessing the groups purposes had recommended that it be dissolved a motion for dissolution then was proposed by young attorney kenneth cockrel of the association of black students it was quickly approved a hint of the conflict said to have plagued the group suddenly flashed into view like an ugly word scrawled on a wall members voted down a suggestion that the federation retain a skeleton structure that would bear its name and solicit funds in the hope of the groups eventual rebirth they opted instead for legal dissolution if theres ever any need for us to come together again we will one young man flung out but the process of dissolution was well underway before the april meeting at any rate wayne state universitys dr karl gregory had resigned as executive director in march at that time it was revealed that the federation had little over in its treasury dr gregory continued to offer his services to the group on a voluntary basis but this alone could not reverse the dark course of events a person close to the organization blamed its collapse on the industrydominated new detroit committees failure to offer financing without strings they had an opportunity to make this a meaningful movement he said now all that has happened is that the real militant movement in this community has gone back underground if the aims of the federation are not realized it can only be blamed on those who failed to make available the necessary funds for its operation the federation spurned a grant from the new detroit committee after the committee decided to fund a moderate negro group as well and stipulated that the federation cooperate with this group yet this was not the sole cause of its troubles a young militant bitterly spoke of the lack of integrity and the personal ambitions of those who had the responsibility of making the federation operative anyone who questions the integrity or possible lack of it in individuals within a group of course is on shaky ground but it is a fact that certain members of the federation doubted the dedication of other members in private conversations it was alleged that a member of the board of directors was continuing to receive his salary from another job while being paid by the federation it was further alleged that another officials financial irresponsibility helped deplete the groups already scanty funds people outside the group complained that it was clannish and insular the same little clique always runs the whole damn show snorted one woman who has been prominent in activist causes a disgruntled federation member alluded to the same issue during the final meeting maybe the problem is this organization has been too much us here and not enough the people out there another problem may have been the groups lack of a clearcut program for action the stress going instead to calls for black solidarity black consciousness and black pride selfdetermination was a goal yes but any new complex of ghettocontrolled cooperative apartments and supermarkets would have required the initial support of white industrialists the only major activity sponsored by the federation during its short span was a malcolm_x day memorial which raised for malcolms widow so for whatever the reasons detroit faces this years long hot summer just as illprepared as it was last year the big rumor stalking the streets of the ghetto is that armed white nuts will provoke an incident leading to a riot so that they can destroy the inner city presently no group and no individual stands as a buffer against these fears the glaring vacuum of leadership exposed by the insurrection of has not been filled as the detroit contingent of the poor peoples march discovered recently when they were trampled upon by mounted policemen downtown no one took up the cause of the poor and no one is capitalizing on the acceptance of a militant approach by many middleclass negroes meanwhile many black people are looking forward to a bigger and better rebellion this summer according to a recent survey by prominent local psychiatrist dr paul lowinger i am not looking for any oversimplified answer to the question who am i it is obvious by now that i am not going to be a great white american dancer but i have little patience with people who suggest that to be a black choreographer one must limit his scope and deal exclusively with traditional afroamerican material the question of an artists identity is one that he continually asks he asks it through his chosen medium by experimentally probing into different aspects of his identity and environment whether one functions as a choreographer who also happens to be black or as a black man who happens to be a choreographer is determined by his point of view at a given moment the ideal point of view at any given moment for the individual artist is the one which best allows him to create the most profoundly exciting art if he cannot produce beautiful and exciting art there is no point in discussing his political or ideological commitments in relation to art the militant black revolutionary may think of art in terms of the whole machinery of the revolution as a means of bringing forth the rich heritage of the african in america and to create a sense of identity for the sake of the revolution most of the existing dance companies which are the instruments of black choreographers have placed their emphasis on traditional afroamerican material they are exploring through their artistry the proud afroamerican heritage and they can evoke poignant images which will encourage intolerance of racial suppression but these images are not the only means of communicating a black consciousness while traditional black art is playing a vital role in the awakening of a black cultural identity now it is equally important for black artists to discourage the crystalization of new stereotype limitations by not confining themselves to oversimplified traditional images i am not suggesting that black artists should or could cut themselves off from afroamerican tradition artist or layman our past experience inevitably affects our articulation of present ideas but if an artists individual sense of immediacy is to vitalize his work he should have freedom to decide which ideas he feels a need to communicate at a particular time artists have felt compelled to create images which called for social changes long before their own people were ready to initiate them otherwise one might never be moved to focus his art on sociohistoric events it is not a question of art for arts sake it is a need to be true to ones own feelings though masterpieces have been created on commissionwith the idea of fulfilling some sponsors visioninfinitely more poor art has been produced by artists who were working with ideas about which they had no deep feelings an artists assumption that he knows exactly what his audience needs often results in art that is at best patronizing the highest compliment an artist can give his audiences is to invite them to witness his exploration of the maximum possibilities of his art based on his total experience the dance that i do is afroamerican simply because i am afroamerican my blackness is part of my identity as a human being and my dance exploration is evolving in relation to my total experience as a man it is simply a question of what is more important in the act of creatingmy total living experiences or those experiences which i consider particularly relevant to my blackness the myth that afroamericans function well only in certain predictable areas is one that both white and black americans have long been conditioned to accept and it must be dispelled the black artists refusal to confine his work to convenient categories will contribute to the destruction of this limited notion each dance i create has grown out of my personal experience as a black american each movement i explore is part of my own personal heritage my emphasis is on exploring through my medium experimenting with dance trying to find fresh ways of evoking physical and spiritual images to make new poetic comments about mans eternal beauty and pathos my function in the revolution will be to share my personal experience through dance a vital and growing experience not to show only old stereotypes or to create new ones james frazier is a yearold detroit musician of more than exceptional ability and promise last spring in a singularly important musical event mr frazier conducted the detroit symphony orchestra in a performance of the difficult beethovens ninth symphony the event was heralded with great pride by musicminded detroiters who had watched the young man develop from a student of local music teachers to a confident conductor already known on two continents for as a matter of fact mr fraziers march stint before the detroit symphony orchestra was not his first four years earlier he conducted the orchestra in a full program of beethoven ralph vaughn williams strauss and rachmaninoff at ford auditorium the occasion marked a first for a black man in michigan in june he won a special award in the international conductors competition at liverpool england where he was the youngest contestant during that same month he also conducted the royal liverpool philharmonic symphony and the british broadcasting corp orchestras mr frazier received his musical education at the detroit conservatory of music and at the university of michigan at ann arbor where he was a student of professor e h green at the young man was minister of music at peoples community church the same church where tenor george shirley and contralto georgia davis received early exposure the church encouraged his musical career and with the united negro college fund inc sponsored mr fraziers conducting debut with the detroit symphony orchestra upon mr fraziers return from england in he was selected to study at the prestigious national music camp at interlochen mich under william smith then associate conductor of the philadelphia symphony orchestra eugene ormandy the famed conductor of the philadelphia orchestra observed mr fraziers performance at interlochen and wrote the following it was with delight that i lismy opinion frazier has the makings of an excellent conductor he has my best wishes for success in his conducting career mr fraziers supporters include the detroit civic opera co inc as slave a black j a woman was woman jr f power instead of woman she was more important as a laborer than as a wife or mother this is still true today today when the average american woman has more freedom than ever before in history to choose her personal path to happiness and selffulfillmentwhether as wife mother artist teacher reformer or as anything and all things she may desirethe american black woman remains a slave to economic necessity the american woman struck a sharp blow for her own independence when she gained societys approval for working outside her home that was one battle the black woman didnt have to fight it was never thought unseemly for her to work in fact for a long time the proportion of black women who held jobs was twice that of white women who worked although since the s more and more white women have been partaking of the privilege of working still today a larger percentage of black women hold jobssome per cent in compared with per cent of white women it is not in history however that we will find the real disparity between white and black woman workers but in todays facts and figures white women today may work to fulfill themselves to fill their days or to earn extra spending money but as information gathered by the department of labor the bureau of the census and other us government agencies shows the black woman works because she has to how do we know lets look first at the jobs at which black women work only people who have to would work as household maids or cooks porters janitresses hospital attendants cooks helpers bus girls or as any of a number of other menial service personnel yet over onehalf of all black women workers held these jobs in not only do such service workers encounter some hard unpleasant labor they also earn salaries lower than those for any other jobs generally below a year add to hard work and low pay the absence from most of these positions of such fringe benefits as paid vacations job security or health insurance enjoyed by workers in other fields and you know for sure that few people would take these jobs out of choice in fact few white women do black women although they are only a tiny part of the entire labor force hold nearly twothirds of these lowstatus lowpaying jobs glance higher up the feminine career ladder and see how quickly the proportion of black women drops the percentage of black women in clerical and sales jobs is onethird that of white women in the professions whites outnumber blacks proportionally almost two to one and when teaching the career of many black professional women is excluded the blackwhite imbalance is greater still and the black woman is out of work and looking for it more often than the white womanin the unemployment rate for black women was twice that for white women now if she didnt have to have a job would she consider herself out of one when she wasnt working hardly if she cant as we have seen find a job that satisfies her soul does she at least have a job that fattens her purse it should come as no surprise that the black woman is the lowest paid person in the us labor force her average salary of a weekwas lower even than that for black men and of course way below the national average lest you wonder the black woman doesnt work to fill her days either she takes outside jobs when other important demands are placed on her time and energy for instance although the majority of white women do not work after marriage nearly half the black women workers are married and even more revealing of the black womans need to work is that although few white women work when they have young children over onethird of the black women do the black woman cannot afford to stay at home with her children the black woman obviously does not want to work in a poor job she must take what she can get with an education cut short most often by financial need for as you can see the black woman does not choose to work she must work because her family must have her income her family may look to her for support because she is the head of the household about onequarter of all black families were headed by a woman alone in but less than onetenth of all white families were half of these women work fulltime many others hold parttime jobs even if she is married she is more often than a white wife the sole earner in the family for the unemployment rate among black married men is twice that among white husbands or she may as do over half of all black wives work to help her husband keep their familys head above water that is she works not to bring in extra income but to bring in enough over onethird of the families in america with incomes below the poverty level are black with only one earner male or female the average black familys income is barely above that level one extra earnermost often a woman adds about to the black familys income and still does not bring it up to the income of an average white family with one earner the black woman works alone or with her husband because she must to keep her family out of poverty youre right of coursethere may well be other reasons for her working she may just want to get out of her house which is probably far from being the american homemakers dream come true in over onequarter of all black families were living in dilapidated or deteriorating housing the black homemaker hasnt money in her budget to fix up her home and she doesnt have the right color skin to move her family into a better neighborhood or too she may work to build a personal nest egg in case her marriage breaks apartand the chances that it will are many times greater than if she and her husband were white her life as a mother is also one that she might well want to escape motherhood can hardly be a joy with too many kids too little money a poor neighborhood bad schools and often no man in the house still underlying all these factors is the same financial need forcing black women to work of course we cannot ignore the fact that many black women have won tremendous success as workers in the professions the arts and in governmental or other careers these women may well work out of choice and for personal satisfaction but they are the exception not the rule among black workers nor can we exclude from these considerations the increasing number of black women who find themselves protected from want in the middle class with decent homes working husbands and the luxury of leisure many of these women still do work though to pay for their privileges the nonworkers among them cannot alter the generally bleak picture the statistics outline for most black women as more black families rise into the middle class more sink deeper into poverty the black leisure class is growing but still small and the nonworking black woman remains in a minority while a majority of her white sisters can afford leisure the average black woman as we have seen is forced to work because she is black in this country she is a slave to economic necessity and her vital economic role all but eclipses her roles as a woman now i am not saying that because she is a woman in america she should be forced to fit some socially prescribed mold of the typical happy american woman she may want to work she may want to combine many roles as do so many other american women she has a right to as full or as narrow a life as she chooses but she herself should be able to choose the path her life will follow only in choice is there freedom now the black woman has no choice now as for over years she is forced to work until she can pick a pattern for her life herself she will remain a slave drkenneth b clark is a scholar of the first magnitude when he comments on blackwhite relationships people listen his work on questions of the socialpsychological effects of discrimination have justly given him a nationwide reputation so that when he discusses such a vital question as black_power and its effects on interracial rapport one can expect his audience to weight seriously the positions he takes and the recommendations he advances it is precisely because of the respect with which he is held that the present remarks seek to reopen the question which dr clark recently attemptedor so it seemsto close in rather summary fashion i refer to his address given on october at the annual meeting of the association for the study of negro life and history held in greensboro north carolina and subsequently reprinted in the january issue of the journal of negro history my remarks are not designed to offend or belittle dr clarks ideas rather they are intended to pursue a question of vital importance to negroes and whites alike i must confess to being greatly disturbed by dr clarks address in greensboro and my subsequent reading of his paper has not lessened my uneasiness in the least i can heartily concur in his statement that the problems of the american negro are problems of america and that the negro remains the essential psychological reality with which america must continuously seek to come to terms moreover his suggestion that discrimination as practiced by insecure american whites is a psychological protection shaped and perpetuated by the dominant majority is also a most penetrating and cogent point and finally i agree that the walls of segregation are not only humiliatingbut given this type of chronic humiliation there develops selfdoubt subtle and flagrant forms of selfhatred personal and group frustrations internalized hostility aggressions selfdenial or bombast having found these important areas of agreement with dr clarks statements i must now take serious issue with his other points the overriding import of his paper is to advocate total and immediate integration as a means of resolving the nations racial problems as a scholar of and an activist in the twentiethcentury civil_rights movement i applaud this objective however deeply regret dr clarks assumptions that this goal can be achieved only by the complete rejection of the concepts and the efforts of black_power advocates in his remarks he makes no efforts to define black_power he gives no legitimacy to that phenomenon he affords it no chance to be heard nor does he try in the slightest to assess and analyze its several dimensions in fact he dismisses it out of hand as a negative and disruptive force the social scientist should make every effort to gather and evaluate his data in objective fashion on the question of black_power dr clark hasat least in the paper presently under discussiontotally failed to do just that he refers to black_power as ambiguous as possessing a nowin premise as being programmatically empty and pragmatically futile and yet he admits the tremendous psychological appeal which it has for the negro masses how can a social scientist cavalierly reject so important a phenomenon without making every effort to examine its substance dimensions and potential my remarks are intended as neither a defense nor a criticism of black_power they are designed simply to counter an intellectual position that would stifle objective discussion and repress analysis of a force in american life that fully merits open examination and serious consideration it seems to me that dr clark is wrong in assuming that black_power is merely a defensive mechanism grounded on hatred of white america and selfhatred among negroes and that its utility is of dubious value if nothing else the advocates of black_power certainly deserve an opportunity to be heard and to be taken seriously in positive terms dr clark admits that the situation for the masses of american negroes continues to deteriorate and yet he persists in believing that remedies of a traditionally approved natureinterracial cooperation to achieve redress through legislation the courts advanced employment opportunities and the likeare the only means to secure a full remedy does this not impose upon the negro whose position is already so difficult in this society the obligation of playing the game only by the white mans rules is it really so inconceivable that new and varied approaches might be tried simultaneously with the customary interracial efforts they need not be mutually exclusive what would prevent this nation if it really had the best interests of all in mind from advancing the cause of racial justice in a number of ways through varied techniques at one and the same time for over one hundred years black americans have played the game by the white mans rules and they have not yet won their full share of this nations promise this does not negate the possibility that they may yet do so nor does it deny the chance that they might do so more rapidly with a variety of strategies including black_power one is reminded for example of the very cogent article by william b hixson in the autumn issue of the american scholarin which he suggested that traditional commitments to law and order simply meant the formulation of a series of rules which protected and reinforced the position of the dominant elements in the society and thereby made more difficult any serious efforts for basic change and longrange reform one need not be against law and order to see that they can at the hands of a dominant majority have repressive manifestations and consequences for an aggrieved minority and if one relies only as apparently dr clark would prefer on a coalition of interested negroes and whites bent on achieving racial justice through interracial cooperation does not one run the risk of being in the very position of young claude brown and his father when they were represented by a white lawyer supposedly seeking damage charges on their behalf against a transit company following the incident in which young clark was struck by a bus in manchild in the promised land claude brown recalled his immediate suspicions well supported by subseqeunt events of the white lawyer in question and when he the white lawyer started talking to menot really talking to me just saying the stupid things that white people say to little colored boys with a smile on their faces and the little colored boys are supposed to smile toonothing in the world could have made me believe that cat was on our side we werent even people to him so how the hell was he going to fight our fight i wanted to ask dad why he went and got this guy but i knew why anybody could see that this cat wasnt so smart no he was just luckylucky that the world had dumb niggers like dad in it is there really any more reason to assume that even the bestintentioned white liberal is in longrange and fundamental terms better able than was this white lawyer to fight the black mans fight there are specific and necessary tasks in the struggle for racial justice that must be performed by negroes themselves on behalf of negroes and this does not in any way smack of racism or hatred for american whites if dr clark is to be believed and taken at his word on the basis of the essay in question he has given no credence to this fact indeed one sees little indication that he has considered it at all dr clark acts as though he does not understand and is not aware of the statements made by black_power advocates about what policies they would advance he talks merely as if they were bent on hatred and destruction this is not the case as clark could see from a reading of stokely carmichaels essay in the september issue of the new york review of books in that instance carmichael clearly emphasized that black_power was not a form of race hatred rather he stressed the need for white people to cooperate in giving black americans a chance to set their own goals and achieve their own objectives by developing a sufficiently solid economic and political base through which they could participate fully in matters affecting them and in the total pattern of american life this is hardly withdrawal it is rather a deliberate and conscious attempt to meet the problems of negro americans in very direct and positive fashion it merits a serious and open hearing and a chance to be tried it will require enormous effort patience and endurance for american negroes to implement black_power in meaningful terms they deserve an opportunity to do so it will take an extraordinary amount of understanding and patience for the dominant white majority to get out of the way and accord negroes this opportunity therein of course lies much of the problem the dominant white majority cannot readily sustain the psychic damage it would face if it truly recognized how corrosive its values and actions have been for black americans it will demand a profound commitment to racial justice for the american white to admit the grave injustices that his system and his leadership have visited upon the black minority once that awareness works its way to a conscious level however then the dominant majority might be willing as it ultimately must beto step back and allow black americans to define their own goals seek their fulfillment and in so doing redefine the landmarks and the guideposts that have customarily marked the path of interracial relations in this country this is what black_power seeks and whether or not its advocates are able to achieve it they fully deserve the occasion to make the effort unfortunately dr clark seems unwilling to accord them that fundamental chance dr clark argues that negroes and whites must cooperate to eradicate the intolerable aspects of ghetto life segregated schools inadequate housing job discrimination the sale and distribution of inferior merchandise the filth and drabness of ghetto streets and the repressive conduct of the police in ghetto neighborhoods black_power advocates share this goal too clark urges experimentation and the use of human intelligence and training in the development of constructive solutions to these problems here again black_power advocates concur what they are saying however is that these goals and objectives should be sought in a number of ways one of which includes policy formulation and implementation by negroes themselves is it really so unthinkable that this should be tried is it really so inconceivable that it might work and that by working it might make a genuine contribution to the overall solution to the racial problem in america by rejecting the possibilities of black_power dr clark really does himself as a social scientist the negro americans as a depressed minority and the nation at large as a troubled society a grave disservice he adopts the same type of negativism and repression that he has so long fought dr clark seems to close his mind to the potentials of black_power on the grounds that it represents a racist solution this is in no sense the case in their recent book black_power the politics of liberation in america stokely carmichael and charles v hamilton have given the lie to this assumption there is no reason to equate black_power with the racism of white supremacists the former seeks positive solutions leading to a strengthened and stable negro community that can take full advantage with whites of the promise of american life the latter is and has been motivated by hatred and the concept of perpetual racial separatism there is no parallel whatever between black_power and white supremacy in their motivations conduct and goals as carmichael and hamilton have explained the goal of the racists is to keep black people on the bottom arbitrarily and dictatorially as they have done in this country for over three hundred years the goal of black selfdetermination and black selfidentityblack_poweris full participation in the decisionmaking processes affecting the lives of black people and the recognition of the virtues in themselves as black people the black people of this country have not lynched whites bombed their churches murdered their children and manipulated laws and institutions to maintain oppression dr clark has failed to make this necessary distinction and yet it is a difference which is absolutely crucial for both the social scientist and the american layman to understand and accept if we are to fashion new instruments functionally positive instruments that will help us allblack and whiteto resolve the terrible dilemma of racial oppression in this country black_power may not be the answer certainly it is not the only approach which this society can and must take but the advocates of black_power deserve a hearing and the chance to make an honest effort their potential contributions merit the recognition and support of the nation at large such openness by the dominant majority is after all the true test of a free and democratic society it seems incredible that a nation grounded on the values of risktaking and innovation should seem so reluctant to accord the american negro this vital opportunity to make a series of efforts on his own behalf initially to the possible benefit of us all in longrange terms if black_power were given its day there is no reason why fullscale and active interracial cooperation could not proceed simultaneously there is no reason why a variety of strategies could not be implemented to meet a complex range of racial problems americas racial difficulties are sufficiently numerous and perplexing and the size and resources of the nation sufficiently ample that we can and should sustain for example a stokely carmichael a floyd mckissick a ralph abernathy a roy wilkins and a whitney young at one and the same time pluralism in action means just that in an open society to deny such a possibility as dr clark seems to do is to give away the ball game before we have even taken to the field that would be totally inexcusable my stance is racial and no apologies for that the world is in such a bad state today because of white racism because of the white worlds denial of the supremacy of the spirit because of the white worlds denial of love i do not write english the language of a

physical confrontationis going to be a second from now so will my son i hope that pernicious and wayward white lady lula in dutchman says she wants clay to have his manhood says she wants him to be a bad nigger what she doesnt know is that clay is already a bad nigger already has his manhood a manhood more potent than anything this silly white girl ever imagined when clay reveals himself to be a true man a black man who has no use for her kind she has only one alternative to deny that he exists or ever existed for not to do so would cause some seismic trembling in one of the universal laws you know the one that says niggers sambos uncle ts colored boys and wouldbe black men whose manhood is bestowed upon them by the merciful great white woman can exist but true black men cannot and so lula not prepared to alter the natural order in an effort to refuse him meaningful space stabs clay in the back this is what happened to marse william styron when he looked up and discovered nat turners manhood turner was so beautiful so black so together with his person and his people that marse styron set outdeliberately mind you to kill him to hide him away to pretend that he never existed this is the sick italian iago bringing the beautiful black othello down this is the white crackerpoliceman in an alley shooting some fleeing nigger boy in the back this is the dream of western civilization the black man never existed that marse willie styron distorted the character of the historic nat turner is an accepted fact see for example william styrons nat turner ten black writers respond published by beacon press but styron attempted to kill to obliterate a complete historical and political tradition of black people that tradition being this black people was and is a rebellious people ostensibly it seems that styron is favoring this tradition by making a black rebellion the subject of his major preoccupation a close examination however shows that his whole intent is rather to destroy that tradition completely unlike most white people who go around smugly halfbelieving that blacks as slaves never revolted styron leaps into the mouth of a black revolt takes out his can of white paint and goes to work when he is finished the thing is perfectly camouflaged against the equally white landscape which is americas sick white mind nat turners revolt taken in its simplest form was a political act an act that should be and it certainly is inspiration for his people today and this is what styron was afraid of so he avoided the political implications of the revolt by reducing the affair to a level of psychological stereotypes which has the added advantage of making this strange tale plausible to whites it is this psychological stress in the novel that makes styrons nat sound like some sensitive faggish art major whenever he opens his mouth this is why every time styron alias thomas gray pops a political question like why did he nat kill joseph travis who was a good slavemaster the answer to such a question is obviously because he is a white m f and there is no such thing as a good slavemaster this is a political response but styrons nat is not capable of that his response is psychological due to his extreme sensitivity for a moment i was so surprised that i couldnt speak i sat down slowly then the surprise became perplexity and i was silent for a long time saying finally even then thatthat l cant give no reply to mr gray page confessions before the novel is over styron comes right out and calls nat and his revolt a flatassed failure p and do you think nat gives him a political response back telling this cracker that there is no such thing as an unsuccessful black revolt because every time a black fist raises over a white head we are just that much closer to overcoming the vipers every white throat cut is a success in itself but styrons nat doesnt have a brain doesnt have an ideology his head has been addled with sensitivity and so his response is i felt myself shivering as i gazed downward between my legs at the plank floor and at the links of cold cast iron sagging like a huge rusting timber chain in the chill dim light suddenly i felt the approach of my own death my hands trembled my bones ached i heard grays voice pp this cats nothing but a bundle of nerves styron used this extreme sensitivity bit as a smoke screen behind which to hide the political implications of turners revolt consider the following statement a black leader and some black followers killed of their white oppressors from the point of view of black people this is a beautiful artistic statement and it is artistic because it unifies all sociological economical political etc implications of these black people it implies that these people are fighting a common enemy it implies brotherhood love and trust among these people it is a positive heroic inspiring optimistic statement it says a lot that only black people can understand its black poetry it is otherwise when a white man reads this statement first it is not a reality to white people that they can be killed by blacks in the free world the price of white life is very expensive and that of black life dirt cheap it is a tacit understanding between the gangs around the woodlawn area in chicago and the police that the gangs can take the lives of little nigger children but if they kill a white student for example from the university of chicago somebody has to payand it doesnt matter who as long as he is black nat turner stands in black history as one who didnt look at the price tag when he revolted he didnt give a damn who was a good or important cracker he went out to slaughter the white oppressor period and so he did styrons book is not a meditation on history its a meditation on the political implications of this simple statement some black men killed their white oppressors styron seeks to soften the hard impact of such political implication by expanding that simple statement into pages he set out to change the speed of a rifle bullet headed for some honkies brain into the soft drop of a tear shed for the miserable state of those colored people set out to change the flying crash of a flaming molotov into the familiar thump of the sunday newspaper thrown by the local colored boy the success of this attempt can be attested to by the fact that when one finishes the book he finds it difficult to believe even if he is black that real black men cut real throats for their freedom one finds that styron has worked some wicked magic the fact is changed into a phantasy the action into a reaction the black into white and you into a fool a fool because no black person needs to know what went on in nats mind he has only to consult his own status in life to know that white liberals like styron always want to know the black man but when they say they want to know what happened in nats mind they are assuming that the statement some black people killed their white oppressors is meaningless a black leader like nat doesnt begin to mean anything until they are told that he has a white mind and that all the influences in his life were white it is only then that he becomes a significant leader and so they gradually begin to know him the assumption behind this is of course only white really exists if l dont imagine myself a black man styron said to himself as he painted his face with black paint how am i ever going to know that black people exist one certainly cant take their word for it in short styrons confessions of nat turner is a deliberate attempt not to see the political reality of black people it is an attempt not to see the thousands of nat turners in the ghettos of hundreds of american cities it is an act of negative hallucination thats what the psychiatrists call itin an effort to pretend that black people are not a rebellious people the book seeks to deny the obvious political connection between nats revolt and the revolt of black people today indeed the two revolts are different only in the sense that lovers are different styron belongs to a tradition of southern writers that gives the impression of actually dealing with the problem of black and white relations when what in fact it does is attack any new reality that threatens its nostalgic southern order in its avoidance of real issues this tradition connects withand gains support fromthe artforarts sake school and this is how you get those stupid university of chicago types who want to see the novel just as a work within itself this is fidgeting art and propaganda styron represents the white mans last futile attempt to overhaul his shottohell and fagged moral psychic this man is desperate now he will do anything to absolve himself of his guilty past whenever there is a riot white liberals choke on their fright and guilt this is as it should be so it is understandable why they are willing to believe those huge lies styron tells in his book white people are beginning to realize that the oppressor is immoral and that the liberator is moral and free and hence beautiful this is after all a very recent idea for during the th century and the early th it was widely accepted that the oppressor the survival of the fittest was the moral being now its the other way around the survival of the fittest and white people know they are the oppressor and are immoral and sick creatures styrons book attempted to change this as incredible as it may sound by making the black people the oppressor and the white crackers those gentle benevolent landowners whose sole purpose in life was to liberate darkies the liberator this is why one black critic complains that in styrons propaganda piece nat turners rebellion is depicted as a worse crime than slavery ten black writers respond p styron didnt get that pulitzer prize for nothing styrons novel is an example of a sick literature and i mean the term sick in the most technical sense freud and normal o brown talk about mentally disturbed people as being at odds with their past either they deny it or accept it to be something it is not marse styron still thinks this is year dumb cracker and furthermore there is a great tendency to escape something imminent in the present styron says his book was not meant to comment on the black revolt of today while at the same time white reviews are using it as an argument against h rap brown and stokely carmichael in its attempt to escape the present to separate politics from art the past from the present history from existence in its attempt to fragmentize rather than unify styrons novel is sick literatureie propaganda art unifies it connects the past with the present sociology with psychology politics with art this is what leroi jones means when he says aesthetics and ethics are one but cracker willie styron cant say this because he doesnt want to see the relationship between the past and the present to do so would be admitting openly that marse w styron is an immoral racist oppressor etc and thats too close to home sick literature and propaganda fragmentize true art unifies black writing leroi jones represents a new school of writing and critical thought that is the exact opposite of that of william styron the principle that aesthetics and ethics are one is the foundation for this new school black writers and critics are the only people who can possibly launch this new literature the only people for whom it has meaning as they are the only people who will benefit from emphasizing the oneness harmony and integrity between the present and the past between what is said and what is done between history and fact between literature and for example eating habits the oppressor is always an immoral being people liberating themselves are the only moral people when facts history and sociological statistics oppress they become not fact but fiction not history but fantasy not statistic but alchemy a people liberating itself justifies all only a healthy and moral people can breathe life into letters literature is alive only when it can move freely between the past and present without the anxiety of stumbling on certain facts like america murders million people a literature is alive and free and beautiful and hence useful only when it is not guiltridden white literature is guiltridden and at odds with its past witness styron and needs to be psychoanalyzed hence alas norman mailer black writers need not attempt to salvage a sick white literary tradition that refuses to see black existence that refuses to give meaningful space to black bodies no we black writers have a responsibility to our people the styrontype you can hurry up and believe has his responsibility to his our responsibility is to expose the moral vacuousness of the white viper nat called him the serpent reveal to our people his immoral system and to prepare our people for the day when his sickness finally engulfs him the middle of the night mr stewart duff lay sleepless and in the most melancholy mood he reached for the lamp beside his bed he missed it and reached for it again this time he knocked it to the floor he grunted jumped from his bed and angrily flipped the light on now that he could see it and put it securely in the middle of the table he gave a gloriously resonant belch and sat down on the side of the bed his grandnephew slept in the next room in the deep quiet mr duff could hear the boy snoring unperturbed by the noise of the falling lamp mr duff wished he could sleep so soundly but he was feeling poorly again and how could he sleep when he could not lie down to rest he didnt know exactly what was wrong but he did know that he was ill he felt a cloud of dizziness and he again belched loudly during the afternoon mr duff had dined with his old friend mr alton the two of them had not seen each other for many many years mr alton had left the town when they were both hardly more than boys and the years had danced away leaving them old and heavy of feet and heart mr alton had lost his wife to the same death that stole his only son in war he moved back to his hometown and took a room at a boarding house a yellow building which seemed forever in a state of awkward peeling like an old piece of documentation parchment the encounter between the longparted friends was teary mr duff cried very easily mr alton wheezed a great deal and kept smiling he left most of his food untouched mr duff ate heartily sometimes through crystaline tear drops which were almost silverlike in the brash gleam of the lights mr duff was happy to receive a dinner invitation seldom had he gone anywhere lately for his contemporaries in the town were either moved away or living on the fringes of the lives of their children or grandchildren mr duff had a highly developed sense of self it was always there beneath the marks of time behind the wrinkles which cut gashlike into his face behind the eyes discolored by years of useage and it was present also in the manner of walking when he was strolling alone he could become brisker and more supple than younger men he knew still he liked to know that he was thought about emershed thus within himself mr duff had not contended with the possibility that people might be weary of listening to a man who had outlived all of his friends and most of his relatives many of whom had been possessed of such great charity that they had stood beneath the girdings of the community like pillars as bulwarks in spirit and in gesture and that he now was decrying his fate into the sympathies and the cool ears of the most recent generations he could hardly know that younger people measured the possibility of their duration on this earth by his old age and wondered if they could attain it and by what fatedefying methods nor could he know that people little younger than himself felt humanly insidious and with the most vulgar and the grossest of superstition that mr duff was living on their time he was for them a stopwatch something to measure an unerring time by and therefore he was a symbol of life and a heralder of death mr alton had asked about his wife but he changed the subject when he realized that mr duff didnt wish to discuss it besides he had not known her but the landlady informed him later that the woman had left mr duff and moved in with her children in new orleans she had an unaccountable disease it was said mrs edwards added under her breath and in a sniffling voice im sure it was her heart anybodyd have a bad heart living with that selfish monster acts like he got some option on life aint nobody else got never been well a day in his life aint never been known to ask nobody else how theyre feeling though naw sir dont nobody visits him cause folks tired o being treated like they doctors and he got people here too in town but they dont go see him either last christmas i did go there to take him a basket when i heard he was real ill when i got there he was carving little animals out of wood but he wouldnt let himself be well for once before i left he had given me a complete goover of his sickness the next day he come by this way big as life i closed the shades real tight today was the first i seen of him since i got to live too you know everybody got to live for themselves mr alton was remembering mr duff as a boy but there were too many blurring images and too great an overlapping of memories his heart could not define and carry the impact of it he concentrated on the present and found himself thanking mrs edwards for a very good dinner then he excused himself and went down the hallway to his little room he took out his pocket watch to see what time it was it had grown dark and he contented himself to sit by the window and rest dusk had fallen when mr alton awoke from the restful sleep which had overcome him he startled himself upright but it had grown chilly in the huge drafty room and his limbs ached his left leg had fallen asleep and when he stomped it lightly on the floor to start the blood circulating again a million icy pinpoints sprang into it and he fell into the chair to cry out from the discomforture he sat still and waited finally he could stand without the unpleasant edginess he prepared himself for bed and when his tired head touched the oldfashioned high pillows he was already snoring and dead to every sound of the house the town and the world at six oclock paul mr duffs grandnephew woke up for the last time that morning he had tossed for most of the long night and he was gruff in spirit angry with his uncle for having kept him awake with his insomnia several times he wished to call his uncle and find out what was bothering him but he decided against it his uncle would surely seize the opportunity to begin his customary enumeration of all his real and imagined illnesses and sleep would be impossible after listening to him the house was quiet now paul bathed and dressed he ate a jam sandwich and drank some milk he was in a hurry recently he had gotten a job at a supermarketthe largest in the townas a stock boy he was the first and only black boy there and he wanted to do the most commendable work possible someday another boy who needed the job as much as he had needed it might find it to his liking it was a long enough thought for a yearold boy he had wished to say im gone to his uncle but he was afraid to after last night he knew that it would be more difficult than ever to get away from him he did like living with his uncle and he did love him but it was becoming hard not to hurt his feelings and he wished he could understand him he thought about the story of the boy and the sheep and how the boy had cried wolf so many times it seemed to him that his uncle was similar to that boy but it made him chuckle to compare his graybeard of an uncle to a little boy and he raced down the road he hoped his uncle would not appear suddenly at the door at the section of town where the streets were paved and bordered with trees and grass paul slowed down and began to walk at an even cool pacemr alton an early riser had begun to drink the last of several cups of coffee brewed so well by mrs edwards he considered telling her how fine it tasted but he remembered her cruel discussion of his old friend duff and he merely nodded when she passed his table on her way back to the kitchen she hadnt known duff when he was a young man when he was as straight and tall as an oak and when it would have embarrassed him to mention to any other person so much as a mild headache they were both good hunters in those days and fishermen too he remembered that duffs father had owned the finest buggy in the whole county and that he was also the first black man to own an automobile in those days there was no woman who would have closed her shades against the approach of duff unless she was touched in the head he thought he would drop by to see his friend they could reminisce from the strength and glow of those days so very long ago his friend would recall a quiet happiness to take away the bitter encroachment of a helpless old age nearing mr duffs house mr alton could see that the old man had not begun to bestir himself into the new day he rapped at the door and turned to see a woman feeding a stray cat some scraps of meat he knocked again there was no answer he walked around the house listening quietly to hear any waking sound which would mean that his old friend was home he knocked again at the back door and he started to leave a note but there was a light in the room and so he went to the window and tapped it with his walking cane he thought about mrs edwards recounting her visit to duff and her description of his imagin ary illness he wondered if he might indeed be ill but he realized that a grandnephew who lived with duff would be the first to attend to his uncle the old man peered into the window for good measure he could see someone lying in a slumped position but he didnt know if it were duff or the nephew he didnt wish to behave in a silly alarmist fashion he called loudly and he did become alarmed he called to the woman feeding the kitten together they opened the door and propped the old man onto the pillows he was not speaking and his pulse was worse than faint he was a very sick man sister do you own a phone that you might call a doctor without answering the woman streaked from the house moments later mr alton watched his old friend leave for the hospital in an ambulance and curious neighbors come to see the old man down the street found dying in his room all by himself when mr duff awoke in the hospital room much later his nephew paul his brother ernest his niece mattie and mr alton came in to see him he couldnt recall the last time he had seen them all together the visitors explained to him that he had suffered indigestion and a stroke yes he said i was sick all night long i was sick as i could be it sure means something to have somebody care about you dont it now but the visitors were silent and paul stared at his old uncle for a long long time before he left the room his mother followed after him soon the group of relatives were standing on the sidewalk in front of the small town community hospital mr duff in his room alone turned his face toward the cool aqua walls beyond the partition in the middle of the room he thought someone coughed without seeing anyone though he whispered i was sick i was sick all night long sick as i could be tomorrow i will lose the door on this dream chapter of my life forever i know full well that in doing i will forfeit much true happiness and just possibly my chances for ever again achieving such satisfaction but so it always has been and so it must be life is like this to force a man to choose between that which provides him an admirable public posture and that which gives him personal joy and fulfillment as squire of mount vernon and hero of fort le boeuf already i have achieved more than most accomplished men of my age and station tomorrow taking as my wife martha dandridge custis i shall improve my station fourfold the widow will bring to me some additional acres of valuable virginia land plus a good slaves and an elegant town house in williamsburg further she will open to me because of her social connections what remaining avenues there exist to the seat of power in williamsburg at the age of on my next birthday a month and some days away i shall be a man of considerable wealth and consequence all this is not to be taken lightly and yet it will not be so easy as all that the fanciful pleasures of my career as bachelor squire of mount vernon have been great it will be difficult to abandon them forever i know that i shall spend agonizing nights longing for flora that so aptly named vixen of my terrible desire i shall suffer remembering her soft strong body her taunting laugh even her musk soft yet strong like her body but above allthe maddening dance which she used to fire me to torment me to have her way with me to degrade me for yes she degraded me time and again she degraded me if it had been possible to hate her i would have destroyed her long ago i would have told louis to use the lash on her i would have put her in the fields broken her spirit with the hardest of work fed her to thor the black stud instead i permitted her to degrade me she would come to my bed taunting me saying master and saying that with just the most bearable kind of sarcasm saying master if you are good to akar then i will make you happy i will give you pleasure you can know no other place and i bargained with her i the master of mount vernon the master of her very life bargained with her i had only to command her she was mine to do as i bade but i bargained with her in order to enjoy her smiles her caprice i gave in to her i let her degrade me and yet it was through the dreams of flora that i finally saw deep into my own nature her female cruelty led me to selfdiscovery because of her guile i know now that marrying mrs custis is the best thing for me that will save me the marriage will force upon me the style and pattern of life which will make it forever impossible for me to sink so low as flora brought me it is strange now to sit here by the fire as the night grows old with the servants long since asleep and the january cold seeping through the sills and to recall the fantasies which have brought me to this moment the winters at wakefield were always terribly cold it seems although i remember so little specifically about them mostly i recall hannibal the slave the huge handyman who was my fathers favorite it seems to me now that it was during the winters that i saw most of him lawrence my halfbrother was always away for he was too old to be of much companionship and so it was hannibal who was assigned to look after me he would put me to bed and then sit watching the fire in the fireplace until i fell asleep sometimes if i awoke in the night he would still be there sitting beside the dying fire i did not realize until much much later that he remained there because sarah his slave woman had been sold he stayed because it was warm in my room the drafty cabin which he shared with a group of male slaves was miserable but i did not realize that he sat in the chair and slept one night i awoke to find him standing beside my bed using my slopjar i watched in fascination i had never seen anything so large but more than that i was shocked at hannibal using the slopjar slaves never used anything that belonged to their masters hannibal had broken that law because he knew that he could not return to my room once he had left the house to go to the outhouse in the slave quarters i no longer remember what stroke of malice prompted me to tell my father what hannibal had done but i do recall that my father was so angry that he personally took the strap to hannibal i watched in shame and guilt as my father led the giant black man to the stables and there in a space used by the boys who tended the horses as a clearing among the bales of hay made him strip off his shirt and breeches hannibal stood there his great body bare except for a white rag around his private parts his muscles seeming to ripple in the sunlight flowing in the stable door i recall experiencing a quiver of fear my father was not a large man and not especially a strong one but there he stood ordering hannibal to kneel before him i knew that had he possessed the courageor madnessto do so that hannibal could simply have taken my fathers neck in his hands and broken it but there was something else which i felt something more subtle and sinister a feeling whichthanks to godi would not understand for many years to come hannibal knelt and my father proceeded to lash him with all his strength throughout the ordeal the black man never once cried out never even murmured even though great whelps rose across his broad back and shoulders and blood streamed down his body it was winter a short time following that incident when my father died i was then living at my fathers farm near fredericksburg it was a bleak and terrible time and i was relieved when spring came and i could help supervise the planting and the operation of river farm i did not care much for school but i was very fond of moving through the fields watching the slaves at work and helping mr thornton our overseer to manage the farm i did not like it at all when in i had to go to live with my brother lawrence at hunting creek i was then and i already was beginning to have wilder fantasies i was very curious about the sex lives of the slaves and on occasions i would wander down to their quarters late at night and pass quietly among the cabins some of the sounds emanating from the cabins filled me with ambiguous feelings i was both excited and repelled it was particularly outside the cabin of thor the stud slave that i lingered he was quite popular with the women even when it was not a matter of business for the plantation and there always was some woman in his cabin i was intrigued by thor perhaps because in physical aspect he so reminded me of hannibal but he had few other of the attributes of my fathers slave where hannibal was kind and patient thor was cold and arrogant where hannibal was docile and yielding thor was bold and defiant hannibal knew he was a servant thor knew he was a valuable commodity a producer of healthy slave children for the plantation the slave lawrence had given me as my personal servant was a son of thor a boy some five years younger than myself for some reason thor was especially fond of this particular boy who he had named akar after he said his own family back in west africa thor took the boy in hand and taught him athletic tricks taught him hunting and scouting in the woods along the potomac because he was mine he had to do only the minimum of work in the tobacco fields when not in my service he spent most of his time around the stables he learned to ride quite well and i used to take him with me on jaunts across the country and along the potomac by the time he was he already was as solid and as sturdy as a man of it was clear that he had inherited the physique and the potency of his father it was in fact during akars fifteenth year that lawrence died once again death had come to challenge me and to alter my fate i was now and mount vernon which lawrence had built for his wife anne was mine the responsibility of the huge estate was in my hands and i knew that i had to demonstrate that i could handle it mr thornton was brought over from river farm to act as overseer and i plunged into the task of making mount vernon one of the most prosperous farms in all of virginia but all of this dedication to work did not preclude me from serving in the militia i had been named adjutant and there was plenty of work to do whenever possible i took akar with me for he now served as my valet when robert dinwiddie lt col of virginia selected me to take a contingent of men to ride to presque isle to warn the mischiefmaking french against further advances on crown territory in the ohio valley i arranged to take akar with me we rode off into the woodlands heading north and west of the virginia territory facing not only the treacherous french but also the wild and dangerous indians winter came early that year it was cold and it snowed heavily before we reached fort le boeuf at one point we became lost in the forest two of our pack mules slid off a ravine and we ended up with virtually no provisions to add to our problems we found ourselves completely surrounded by a band of hostile redskins that was when i thanked god that i had brought akar along the indians descended upon us as we stopped for the evening to set up camp beside a rushing stream before we could reach our muskets they were all among us my men were panicstricken and it was not from the cold alone that they trembled but akar stepped forward and addressed the indian leader he held out his hands and smiled in some sort of greeting and the indian leader responded with a similar gesture they touched hands then shoulders then touched hands again the indian smiled then turned and said something to his own braves many of them pushed forward to touch akars hands and shoulders in the same manner that their leader had done it was clear now that they were not going to harm us they did not pay much notice of the white men there but they did not menace us they came forward and settled around in groups at one point akar said to me that he was going to ask the indians for food but you do not know their language i cautioned him akar only laughed all men of goodwill speak a common language he said they will understand he returned to the indian leader and with gestures indicated that we had lost our mules and our provisions the indian nodded as if he understood then spoke to one of his lieutenants at once a group of the redmen disappeared from the nowglowing fireside in less than an hour a new party of redskins arrived on the scene but what a strange safari there was at least two dozen of them including a bunch of slim young girls holding blankets up to their faces so that only their dark eyes surveyed us they had brought two horses apparently to replace our lost mules and a basket of maize and dried fish but the prize parcel was a freshly killed doe which they proudly dumped at akars feet while the militiamen set about skinning the animal and preparing it for cooking over the open fire a curious event took place a dozen or more yards away from the fire the braves began erecting a wigwam i had assumed that akar somehow had communicated to the indian leader that i was both his master and the leader of the militiamen but that appeared at once not to be the case the indians did not at any time pay the slightest attention to me or to the other white men akar was the center of all their attention when the food was ready they urged akar to eat well which he did having a fullsome and healthy appetite finally the indian leader bade akar follow him over to the little tent which had been set up akar stood in the doorway and laughed with delight then he entered the tent alone almost at once i heard girlish giggles emanate from the tent and then i realized that none of the young girls was standing about they were all inside the tent with akar the militiamen were both astounded and annoyed why do they favor that black boy of yours one of them demanded with great surliness what do they see so wonderful in him the others chorused their agreement if i may say so major one of them dared to begin that young buck of a black needs to know his place i got up from my place and wandered in the direction of the tent i was in the throes of an unobtainable excitement the sounds coming from inside the tent thrilled and tormented me i could distinguish akars sighs his heavy breathing and now and then an indian maiden cried out in commingled pain and joy i paced around the tent oblivious of the indians and of my own men i wanted to thrust aside the tent and to look upon the scene a wildness possessed me on an impulse i moved toward the tents entrance but the indian leader stepped forward and barred my way the face that had smiled at akar now glared at me but i am his master i shouted i am commander here and that boy is my slave for an interminable moment the indian stared into my face he said nothing at all at length he merely shook his head that was enough one glance around us showed me that the braves were alert for action there was nothing to do but to return to the fireside and wait when finally i drifted off to sleep in my blankets the revelry in the tent was going full score several other of the militiamen already were asleep but all the indians remained awake silent watchful solemn at dawn when we all awakened there were no indians there was no wigwam and there was no akar we searched and shouted for the slave but there was no sign of him either he had run away with the indians or else they had forced him to accompany them for me it was easier to believe the latter i could not image that akar would ever voluntarily run away from me i had always been a kindly master to him as we rode off toward presque isle it was clear that the militiamen resented me for my leniency with akar it was an affront to them that the slave had run off they had secretly looked forward to abusing him for what had happened during the night i knew that they wanted to teach him a lesson and he had foiled them but the great loss was mine i had become dependent in many ways upon akar and i already missed him i kept telling myself that he would follow behind us after he had satiated himself with pleasure with the squaws i was not prepared to accept anything else the hazards of the journey deflected my thoughts from my prodigal slave and when we encountered the french we found them impertinent and defiant nevertheless we delivered his majestys warnings to them against their incursions into crown territory and then we set out for the return journey to williamsburg when we reached the country where akar had vanished we found no trace of any human beings although i forced the militiamen to scour the area and we made camp at precisely the same place where we had met the friendly braves after two days there with the militiamen constantly grumbling we embarked on the final leg of our journey when we arrived back at williamsburg we had been gone for more than weeks back at mount vernon i prepared my report of the journey which was published as the journal of major george washington in the report i made it quite clear that the french were recalcitrant and that further difficulties could be expected from them in the ohio valley the report was very favorably received by lt gov dinwiddie who immediately decided that i would have to lead a force of volunteers into the territory to challenge the french the following april was set at the time of my leaving virginia but in the meantime another slave emerged to trouble my life i had contracted a rather bad cold during the journey west and so it was necessary upon my return that i have rest and medication dr james rode in to see me several times and i was put in the care of annes maid lucybelle it so happens that a few days later lucybelle fell on the stairs and wrenched her ankle as a result her young daughter was sent up from the quarters to fetch and carry for me i suppose i had seen the child beforecertainly i had for lucybelle had brought her to the big house on many occasionsbut not in recent years and so her appearance came as a decided shock she was in the very bloom of her years her young breasts were full her body firm and astonishingly mature her small head regal her face at once innocent and alluring was i feverish could i george washington squire of mount vernon master of many slaves promising officer of the kings servicecould i be excited by a mere black servant girl my slave or was i afflicted with the incurable disease of fantasy it was too ridiculous to consider seriously i merely regarded the girl accepted her ministrations gave her instructions and tried to relax and read there was much to do before the april excursion many reports to scan much planning to do learning of a few key french words in order to communicate with the foreign forces around presque isle still the girl was there alive looking down at me serving the broth changing the linen her reality was undeniableas undeniable as her extraordinary beauty now it is common of course for slaveowners to take their pleasure among their slaves and i am rare for not having done so the officers at fredericksburg made great sport of me thinking that i spend hours cavorting in the hay with the comely slaves after all i am a bachelor i am without responsibilities to a wife or to a fiancee why then do i not have little halfwhite pickaninnies trailing about the quarters those mulattoes who are on the premises are the issue of the overseers and it is whispered of lawrence but i have abstained but now everytime she is near me my body fires i feel a restlessness which is different in aspect from that excitement which comes to me when i go to the quarters and listen outside the cabins or when i see the great muscular body of thor arched over one of the yielding women what is this difference one morning as she turned to go i called to her flora i said come here come to me she came shyly standing silent her brown hands folded before her where is lucybelle i asked how is she doing lucybelle mending well sir she cannot yet come up the stairs is there anyone else in the house now no sir they are all working in the fields and at the stables the cook is in the smokehouse i regarded her well experiencing an unfamiliar delight in her quiet submissiveness i was emboldened where have you been that i have not seen you girl working in the fields sir and at night what do you do at night she did not hesitate or blush which was good we sing and pray sir then it is time to sleep we must rise before dawn sir and your man who is your man have you been bedded by thor she stepped back affronted sir i have no man i am but now lucybelle keeps thor away so thor has been after you sir thor is after every woman it is his work sir i laughed at that indeed it was so it was thors work work which he dearly loved you are a virgin then i said with some disbelief it was difficult to imagine such a prize being untouched the girl was not embarrassed lucybelle keeps me so sir yes lucybelle would i thought lucybelle ruled the big house and it was not surprising that she tried to rule the quarters as well she was as straitlaced and puritannical as any williamsburg matron suddenly on impulse i said take off your clothes girl i want to have a close look at your body without protest she obeyed stripping bare standing before me like some yoruba queen i felt both fear and excitement i wanted to reach out but my arms would not rise i wanted to seize her and to thrust her beneath me in the bed but my manhood failed me her presence overwhelmed me rendered me impotent was it real was i dreaming what shall i do now sir she asked i could not speak for a moment only stare and then i turned away in shame put your clothes on i said then return to your duties when she had dressed and was about to leave i said you must not mention this to anyone especially not to lucybelle if you do you will be thrashed yes sir she answered then softly left the room after she had gone the soft sweet musk of her remained exciting me anew i turned restlessly in bed experiencing now all the hard forcefulness which had failed me when she stood before me i got out of bed and went to the washstand to douse my face and head with cold water i was in terrible misery even after lucybelle was well again i kept flora on in the house but there was not much chance to see her i spent most of my time now preparing for the second journey west and in april i took a force of volunteers back over my former trail i was lt col washington now an authority on the growing threat of french intervention into the colonies as fate would have it things went badly on the second journey and i was glad when after many weeks we straggled back to williamsburg the experience had proven humiliating compared to the first journey and i tried to forget it by concentrating on the farm there was much planning and surveying to do and this kept me busy there was not even much time to spend thinking about flora although she was always about the house watching me with her shy dark eyes she had never understood the little scene in my bedroom that morning then about a year later some militiamen arrived on the premises with a most surprising commodity they had gone out to round up a group of marauding indians and had found akar among them the slave had been captured and over the protest of the chief had been brought back to fredericksburg i was in my study when they arrived so i went down to the yard to greet them akar standing with his hands tied behind him was the perfect picture of the noble savage he wore only the leather breechcloth which the indians affected in the summer and his great apollonian body as ideally constructed as a statue glistened in the sunlight he hung his head he did not even look up when i approached when the militiamen had gone i decided to personally take akar back to the stables and punish him in any case mr thornton was out in the fields and could not do the job i took down the strap and stood facing akar he looked directly at me for the first time it was a strange new looka look of mixed mirth and defiance why did you run away i asked him to be free he replied but i was good to you i gave you everything a slave could want you did not give me freedom dont be impertinent you are a slave i own you that is why i ran away i slashed him with the strap he did not quiver i slashed him again harder he only looked at me with that strange new look get down on your knees i commanded akar sank to his knees but his eyes never left my face i did not like facing him so i stepped behind him and delivered two dozen fierce lashes upon his back when that was done i bade him stand then i untied his hands you will work in the fields now i said i will tell mr thornton to give you the hardest work in the fields and i will order him to shoot you down like a dog if you try to run away he only looked at me go now i said go to the quarters and wash your sweaty body he turned and stalked from the stable as regal as an oba i returned to my study but i could not concentrate on the business at hand i was filled with the excitement i had not known now for many months i tore off my clothes and went to my bedroom to lie down as i turned from my window i saw flora crossing the yard from the quarter it was then that like a flash i conceived the idea which set me off on the path to selfdiscovery i threw a silk robe around me and went out into the hallway at the top of the stairs i called out to lucybelle send flora up here at once making my voice as stern as possible then i returned to my bedroom closed the door behind me and waited at her light tapping on my door i bellowed out for her to enter which she did apprehensively i ordered her to disrobe charged as i was with a dark surging force she obeyed me without qualm come to me i said standing before me her eyes lowered she was the very essence of purity i reached out and stroked her breasts let my hand wander down her molded midriff she trembled i went to the windows and closed the blinds that scene was to be repeated time after time so often in fact that i began to neglect the farms i found some excuse to return to the manse during the late morning or before tea time in the afternoon i declined invitations from fredericksburg after awhile i knew that the gentlemen in town were discussing my exploits with approval and that many of them envied me my freedom to expend my energies as i chose still there also was some disapproval after all it was my duty as squire and officer and master of mount vernon to take a bride and to enter legitimately into the social life of the county and in fact i did undertake to pay court to two or three of the eligible young ladies of the region however it was difficult to invest in these relationships anything other than courtesy always it was of the pleasures of my own establishment that i thought still it was possible to own a slaves body and time without owning any part of her that really made a difference to her in time i noted a marked change in flora rather than coming to me in meekness she appeared with a certain reluctance when i commanded her she responded with subdued laughter one morning as i sat on the edge of the bed she suddenly broke into a charming dance circling and undulating about the center of the room when the dance was over she swept up her clothes and ran from the room without my permission as she fled down the stairs i could hear lucybelle shrieking at her berating her what had come over flora what was the reason for her defiance i might have guessed the cause louis thornton spoke to me one evening as we went over the accounts colonel sir i think you ought to know that the slaves are laughing at you down in the quarters that buck akar akar that night after supper i had akar brought up to the yard i had not come facetoface with him since the day i lashed him some two years earlier and he had changed he was now fully grown as powerful as his father thor but more handsome but the greatest change was in the way he looked at me he hated me profoundly it frightened me that someone whom i always thought loved and revered me could despise me so completely but i was master he belonged to me i could do with him as i liked no matter what he thought or how he felt i am going to sell you i told him you have shown that you do not appreciate kindness get your belongings together in the morning mr thornton will take you to the auction at fredericksburg without a word he turned on his heels and marched across the yard back to the quarters s j v it seemed to me that i had just fallen asleep after hours of tossing about when i heard the voice in my room colonel sir please i sat up in bed straining to see in the darkness whos there flora sir the voice said then i saw her standing beside the bed why are you here what do you want i demanded please sir i have come to ask a favor of you a favor yes sir you are going to sell akar sir would you sell me with him will you sell us as a pair fury mounted in me how dare you girl i shouted get out of here at once i will not sell you you will stay here as long as i wish you to she was silent a moment then she said if akar goes i will kill myself i will not live without him i will do what you wish as long as akar is here but i will die if he is sent away i promise you sir with that she moved away and i heard the door close behind her when morning came i gave no orders to louis thornton i mounted a horse and rode off to inspect the farms along the potomac flora and akar had won and so life went on in this way for several years but at i knew that it was past time to alter the pattern it was time to become in fact the eminent and respectable squire of mount vernon the gentleman farmer it helped when flora came to me beaming with joy and announced that she was going to bear akars child tomorrow i will have put all that behind me it has been a dream a fantasy it did not happen at all sitting here on this winter night i have imagined it all yes it was a dream a dream that has ended before it became a nightmare the word came late to the local black artists columbia college a chicago communications school was calling a national conference on arts and the inner city bringing in nonwhite artists social workers and activists from all across in his initial press reby a washington d c firm called j richard taft associates columbia college president mirron alexandroff was quoted as stating the following most of the arts programs in ghetto communities have little relevance to the people living in the communities the programs generally the nation lease handled don t involve them dont reach them and frequently dont even entertain them now for the first time the voices of the inner city will have a forum artists sculptors musicians directors and writers from harlem to watts can tell the establishmen and share with each other their success and failure techniques in the same release names of some of the invited guests were listed novelist john o killens director robert macbeth new lafayette theater in harlem author piri thomas luis valdez director el teatro campesino of del ray california colin carew director the new thing in washington d c and james sherman of the watts writers workshop the release listed the following questions to which the conferees would address themselves what standards for the arts in the inner city whose how can people of the inner city be given opportunity to develop their own art how can engagement with the arts either as participant or audience help individuals to selfesteem to constructive insight into self and society how can the arts bring people into meaningful group and community association can the arts have a conscious constructive relationship to social action when the black chicago artists learned of the projected conference and its programindirectly through contacts in tennessee and new york they were furious they hurriedly got together under the umbrella of the coalition of black revolutionary artists cobra and planned a course of action their fury was based on two main points that a white institution would presume to mount a conference dealing with the artistic needs and direction of black people and that this would be done without any prior consultation with black artists already living and working in the local community for at least one organization in the black community the columbia college conference was particularly grating members of the organizaion of black american culture obac complained that the conference platform sounded as if it had been lifted straight out of the obac statement of purposes a member of obac contacted john o killens in nashville and told him of the feelings of the local black artists when mr killens arrived in chicago on the eve of the conference he called together in his hotel room the other guests of columbia college and told them of the local black artists reaction to the conference the visitors agreed to go along with the local black artists on whatever course of action was decided when the conference opened officially the following day the representatives of cobra were on hand and as the groups serpentine namesake might have done the spokesmen struck the conference a mortal blow taking the floor jeff donaldson denounced the conference as immoral and illegal and pronounced it terminated the visitors joined the local black artists in a black caucus called to draw up a resolution formally ending the conference and the white conferees headed by columbia college teacher harry bouras withdrew to a white caucus to formulate a resolution of their own for tactical reasons the dissenting blacks agreed to allow the conference to proceed with its planned dinner the following night there were two reasons for this the occasion would be perfect for presentation of the resolution from the black caucus and there would be an opportunity to confront dr deton j brooks the black head of the chicago committee on urban opportunity who hadat least partiallyunderwritten the conference in the first place dr brooks was principal speaker at the dinner as a gesture of solidarity among the nonwhites mexican luis valdez was selected to read the resolution from the black caucus here it is western culture can no longer dominate the lives of all men through the devices of racism colonialism and exploitation the reemerging cultures of the third world will define the reality of the future black brown mexican puerto rican and other colonialized people in their communities must decide what art is for themselves therefore the conference which was called arts and the inner city and sponsored by columbia college of chicago had to fail and all other conferences of that nature must fail black brown mexican puerto rican and other colonialized artists will refuse to participate in this kind of exploitation of themselves and their people we support entirely the position of the coalition of black revolutionary artists of chicago which states that black communities must define and control their own culture we contend that only through this kind of definition and control can we achieve human dignity selfrealization and the liberation of our peoples throughout the world it was a historic event for the first time in a formal situation artists from the nonwhite world had served notice that they no longer would submit to the arrogance and presumption of white people in setting standards and judging the legitimacy and validity of their art the repercussions already have been broad and it can be expected that in other parts of the country and the world similar confrontations will take place behind the scenes something equally important was being learned the oldtime hatinhand whiteisalwaysright black leader discovered that his time was over his day in eclipse and that he would have to from now on deal with the angry and militant blacks who are his nemesis also the political powers behind the handkerchief head began to understand even in chicago that the minds of black people are not always for sale the confrontation in chicago was indeed a historical event it is the new thing institutions of higher learning which formerly recognized black people only as creatures to be studied in sociology classes now are reaching out with fivefigure checks and assorted proposals designed to lure black scholars to the faculties and to add black studies to the curricula from yale to the university of florida to stanford to northwestern the gesture is out in the direction of recognizing the reality of black history and culture wondrous is the fallout from the black revolution but revolutions have a way of moving onward and those not caught in the current often find themselves unable to move at the revolutions pace it makes for difficult communication such was the case when a committee of professors in the humanities at the university of chicago under the leadership of german instructor james bruce brought in a contingent of black artists and intellectuals to discuss the possible introduction of a black studies program actually to be more accurate the professors were interested in advice on relevant courses to offer black students in black history and culture it was to have been an all evening conference but for all practical purposes the meeting might have been adjourned after the first half hour playwright leroi jones invited from new jersey as consultant saw to that mr jones gave up the social amenities in matters of black and white some time ago and it was fully in keeping with his style that he got directly to the point you have invited black people here this evening to pick their brains mr jones said in effect but we are not going to let you do that mr jones made it clear that he understood that the professors wanted the black guests to show them the way but he also pointed out that the new way made it necessary that black people do their own thing if the university of chicago is seriously interested in exploring black art history and culture mr jones said then the university must give the money to the black community where organizations and institutions concerned with black art history and culture already are in existence mr jones then referred the professors to the other black consultants at the meeting gerald mcworter a founder of the organization of black american culture obac jeff donaldson representative of the coalition of black revolutionary artists cobra lerone bennett jr ebony senior editor and author of popular books on black history and culture poet don l lee author of two published volumes phil cohran musician and composer leader of the artistic heritage ensemble and founder of the affroarts theater margaret burroughs cofounder of the museum of africanamerican history and art and author artist and teacher curtis ellis bookman and hoyt w fuller negro digest editor there was little else to say the professors had not assembled to hear such a revolutionary proposal and saul bellow the eminent author of herzog and other works was the first to take up his pen and walk most of the other professors remained in a state of shock and puzzlement for another hour or so but the conference for all practical purposes had ended with mr jones introductory remarks one or two of the professors indicated that they would indeed rethink their approach to the whole question of the university and its relationship to the black community which surrounds it and one or two said they thought it a good idea to take mr jones proposal to the university administration there were a few moments of desultory and anticlimactic conversation all around then everybody went back again to doing his thing in recent years it has been increasingly popular for white critics to play down richard wrights contributions to the world not western world of literature indeed these would be critics have literally established their names on firewords thrown at the father of black literature wrights writings have been called everything from comicstrip dogmatization to nonliterature and that in essence is one of the short comings of this biography richard wright by constance webb putnam miss webb doesnt remotely try to enlighten us as to the critical status of wrights work what miss webb does and quite well is give us some personal glimpses of a lifelong friend who happened to be a writer who happened to be richard wright i suggest that newcomers to wright or to the works of wright start with black boy and not this biography miss webb introduces us to wrights family to his early childhood and virtually covers in the first few chapters the same ground as wright did and he in a much better prose form in black boy miss webbs book was very difficult to read and reminded me of a very detailed diary the authors word usage is very uneven and her work is cluttered with incessant quotes of wright in places there is more wright than webb which caused this reader to stop continually and wonder if she had perpetual indigestion it seemed as though every detail regardless of size was painlessly recorded as i understand it miss webb does draw upon a privately printed section of black boy and from wrights diary for the years and hopefully this diary will be published in its entirety in the near future her coverage of wrights association with the john reed clubs and his affiliation with the communist party is valuable in that one can see the direction in which wright was going and one can understand the magnetic hold the party had on him and other black writers which in wrights case was not as deeply rooted as we were led to believe by the mass media and comicbooks wrights associations with marion perkins the black chicago sculptor jack conroy and nelson algren are mentioned but not elaborated upon his friendship with ralph ellison and horace cayton is enlightening yet limited and miss webb does harm to herself as a biographer and to her book as a biography by only superficially hitting on wrights relationship with gertrude stein chester himes langston hughes and of course james baldwin baldwin devotes a number of important essays to his father and one had hoped that this kinship could have been positively dealt with in such a biography wright after fameuncle toms children native son black boy a split with the communist party also recorded in the god that failed the failure of his first marriage and the union in a second marriage with ellen poplar and his reaction to the racial climate in the united statesdecided to take up residence in paris france in paris wright was honored and given the attention that he felt was due him as a writer not a negro writing about black people jeanpaul sartre and gertrude stein introduced him to the various literary circles and for the first few years he was widely interviewed and quoted in the parisian press from his paris base wright began to travel and write nonfiction and social criticism on a much greater scale he traveled most of europe and into the interior of africa his excursion into ghana produced a book black_power which chronicled the african revolution paris did not remain congenial for long wrights writing career did not continue to attract the attention it did in the beginning in fact his next three novels received mixed if not adverse reviews from the press and forced wright to take up other means of support for his family the outsider was considered by some critics to be the first existentialist novel to be published by an american black or white however wright denied this and pointed to his earlier work native son as an example of his first existentialist writings savage holiday and the long dream were immediate failures and enabled the critics to accuse wright of being out of touch with the racial situation in this country as if it had radically changed since wrights departure the reality is that wright never was really out of touch he consistently criticized and hammered at the hypocrisy of the american way due to his unpopular insistence of truth wright acquired many enemies in high places wrights problem was that he never really ceased being a native son and in the final analysis a very unhappy one during his travels wright attracted an amoebic infection and along with his financial and racial problems his health began to fail he was taken by a fatal heart attack in the father was miss webb i feel failed as a biographer her book in no way can be considered complete her friendship with wright and his family undoubtedly clouded her writing and vision her objectivity if there is such an animal was subordinated and punctured by the authors personal point of view she incessantly quotes wright presents lively conversations and is forever introducing us to new and exciting people but throughout all this communication of the mans relationships the biographer gives us no real interpretation of them or of his work she doesnt under or overestimate wrights creative power and she virtually leaves the reader in a state of wonderment the definitive biography of richard wright has not been written and it may take a native son to write it miss webbs book was the authorized biography and one can only hope that the information that was accessible to miss webb will be extended to others who may seek to explore the man the photography was a joy and i found the bibliography quite helpful to read the actual works of richard wright is to read the only complete biography of the man and i feel at this time we would do ourselves justice by doing this first from uncle toms children to lawd today from paris to the south side of chicago we are assured that he richard wright was always a native son in prose or in his use of the hokku haiku i am nobody a red sinking autumn sun took my name away don l lee if anyone originally y doubted the prospects for success of the old civil_rights movement his initial suspicions have certainly materialized in the events of the last two years the revolutions in the black ghetto the waning influence and effectiveness of oldguard negro spokesmen and the increasing antiblack mood of congressall of these events have signalled the end of an era the old movements engine of change guided as it was by the integrationassimilation school of social engineers is on its way to the junkyard of social movement apparatus and perhaps black historians will render the following autopsy having promised the black community far more than attainable with its ineffective propulsion system the derailed engine of change succumbed to dual assaults from militantly impatient blacks and tenaciously adamant whites sursum corda in spite of the inability of the old engine to muster the powerful propulsion necessary to sustain itself it has nevertheless given birth to forces which look most promising in terms of being capable of moving the black community toward human dignity and respect and a much fuller participation in americas economic and political systems the flames of black consciousness and black identity are spreading through the community like wildfire the new mood symbolized by this refreshing black awareness provides us with clues as to what will be the most effective components in the new engine of change that must be constructed for the next phase of the movement all great social upheavals have had their theorists and indispensable vanguard of intellectuals and the new movement must have a similar core of those who are comfortable in the world of social theory on an organizational level such persons are comparable to engineers whose function it is to ferret out elements in a given problem according to esoteric quantitative methodology and when the appropriate methodology is inadequate such professional engineers create new quantitative frameworks that will aid in the solution of the problem a technical organization without its engineering department is likely to be a shortlived entity doomed to failure because of a predictable lack of imaginative and innovative solutions to its complex technical problems similarly a social movement without its theorists can move only so far before it begins to suffer from lack of spirit and clearly defined goals perhaps much of the problem with the old engine of change was that the avowed goalsintegration now and its accompanying accoutrementswere largely irrelevant to the vast majority of blacks as the old engine creaked along its tracks it became more and more obvious to the black masses that the right to live in suburbia was less urgent than the right to man a decent job wherever that job was located so one extremely healthy result of the derailment of the old engine is that goals have been reevaluated and new priorities are being assessed for the vehicle which will propel the new movement and no matter what those goals may turn out to be it is clear that grass roots participation in the black community will be crucial to the success of the new movement and it is on the level of grass roots participation that the new movement could be vulnerable social theorists and intellectuals invaluable and indispensable though they are are not noted for their willingness to dig deep into the practical mechanics of social revolution such is necessarily not the nature of their calling again the new movement can be compared to a technical organization once the engineer has specified or created the quantitative framework within which the problem is to be solved he turns it over to his technical assistantsthe technicians it is the technician who adapts the engineers framework so that it be comes a viable means of accomplishing the task and the same type of division of responsibilities job specialization if you will must be evident in the new movement the technician in the movement is as yet a rare breed partly because far too many blacks have not done enough serious thinking to realize that they too have a definite place in the new engine of change our task then if we wish the new engine to have the necessary internal propulsion is to define the role of the technician and identify those who are qualified to fill that role the technician within the framework of the new movement deals with the task of increasing of the power base of the black community on its most basic most mundane level whether he is involved in a school betterment project or in a training project for existing and potential black businessmen his role remains that of working with the people where the people live at times he may be required to be a provocateur prodding the community into action on issues which have been the focus of much lively discussion but little direct action and this may well be the most frustrating task of the technician because of the apathy that still afflicts the black community overcoming the apathy of the black masses will not be an easy task but it is a vital step in the liberation process the psychological shackles that bind our peoples minds must be loosened before we can hope to remove the more blatant shackles of economic and political deprivation once the walls of apathy are destroyed the technicians role gravitates from provocation to organization it is axiomatic that a social movement will falter and crumble unless there is a viable nexus of grass roots organizations that channel the objectives of an aroused community although the black community is beginning to respond to this historically oppressive system with a new resolve to control its own environment and make those whose actions affect the community responsible to it i have grave misgivings about the direction of the response like an escaped tiger the black community may lash out with such devastating fury that it may well engender white retaliations of such brutal massiveness that hitlers systematic genocide of the jews will seem like a german lovein by comparison and this very point deserves a further comment despite all the assertions about the efficacy of riots look at all the money they poured into watts after the revolution we delude ourselves and do our posterity a grave disservice by recommending or embracing riots as a longrun solution to our oppressive conditions there is a distinct logical inconsistency in the notion that riots which we quite rightly assert are brought on by the brutality and callousness of white society are the appropriate means of bringing that society to its senses for given the callousness and viciousness of white society the inevitable result of successive riots will not be to shock whites into reasonableness rather it will be to cause them to move swiftly to equip their police forces with more efficient weaponry and those of us who watched closely the white reaction to the recent revolutions and to the april outbreaks realize that even now police forces in nearly every major city are being supplied with such weaponry as armored vehicles special gases and electric nets to speak of riotous intimidation to a society which is wellversed in the arts of hideous oppression is to provide that society with an excuse to do what years of slavery and years of de facto slavery could not doannihilate black americans this is a harsh fact but one that must be borne in mind when we consider the particular engine that is to go into the new movement when seen in proper perspective riots are only a shortrun means of exposing the seriousness of the american race dilemma at the point that awareness is aroused in the white community and active concern developed in the black community riots as a tool of social change must be relegated to the tool shed already in the shed are many tools of the old movement including the genus of sitins lieins demonstrations and polite begging failure or reluctance of the engineers and technicians of the new movement to relinquish ineffective weapons will result in psychological disaster in the black community when the people realize that the movement isnt moving witness the fate of those who chauffeured the vehicle of the old movement and consider the disillusionment that permeated the community when it became evident that the putative civil_rights movement was not only riding in the wrong vehicle of change but also was headed in the wrong direction and there was undoubtedly a causal relationship between the two erroneous strategies what then is a possible new tool for the movement an assessment of recent eventsie the sporadic revolutions and the subsequent reactions of the white communityindicates that tactical militancy and veiledthreat diplomacy are potentially potent weapons for the immediate future the riots have shaken the entire fabric of the society the white power structure has finally roused itself to the fact that recurring seasonal disturbances are a distinct possibility furthermore whites realize that short of complete extermination of blacks the riots can never be totally prevented given the power structures desire for law and orderwhich is functional tor a prosperous economic systemwe can expect whites to use a combination of coercion and concessions in attempts to obviate riots thus the new engineers and technicians must be adamant in demanding meaningful concessions and competent in meeting subtle coercion with equally subtle reminders that city hall can be ravaged just as easily as the corner grocery store this is the dangerous game of brinkmanship and there are those who will denounce it as radical but is the problem itself any less radical malcolm_x was quite correct when he stated that the history of this nation is but a study of the efficacy of raw power mercilessly and relentlessly applied nothingsave perhaps the dollar and law and orderis as highly respected in america as raw power if we must wave the bloody shirt to minimize the possibilities of more shirts being bloodied and if this strategy proves effective then the ethnics and morality of doing so become highly irrelevant the day of fighting white power as manifested in police brutality ghetto retroeducation job discrimination etc with love power is behind us the essence of leadership is the ability to use whatever power the constituents have as a fulcrum in winning greater power the black communitys greatest power at the moment is not the fact of a riot but the omnipresent threat of a riot for the reality of a riot can be swiftly crushed but to crush the threat of a riot entails removal of the oppressive conditions which cause them this distinction must be borne in mind our definition of the role of technicians requires that these persons command those skills which are in short supply in the black community it is only too evident that these technical skills are in greatest abundance in the great middleclass specifically the negro middle class nmc a careful analysis of what the new black has wrought the ghetto in terms of white assistance reveals that success in recruiting nmc technicians may be crucial to the viability of the entire new movement when whites found their grip on the old engine slipping they couldnt get out of the ghetto soon enough to be sure some whites have been drawn into the ghetto as a result of the revolutions but the exodus has exceeded the influx and this causes us no real regret because the black community can do without the type of white assistance which arrives with too many strings attached eclectism in receiving white assistance is in keeping with the new mood of the black community the very nature of the new spirit demands that whites who would serve the black community in various capacities be in the words of roxburys brian rollins properly sensitized the black community must be certain that white teachers as an example who would instruct our youngsters know enough black history to counterbalance george washington with the great kings of ancient african empires abraham lincoln with nat turner and marcus garvey eli whitney with charles drew and george washington carver and so on and since teachers impart culture as well teach subjects perhaps the black community should demand that they be properly tuned into afroamerican culture before they are allowed to go prancing down to the neighborhood school we must be certain that we do not attract a new flood of slum tourists and dilettantes who upon discovering that blacks no longer worship at the altar of white society haul themselves off to haightashbury for pot pleasures or back home to rejoin physically the society they never left psychologically the necessity of sensitizing white technicians is an integral part of the surge to place complete control over the destiny of blacks in the hands of blacks while whites muse and debate over the advisability of surrendering themselves to a sensitizing process as a condition for being technicians in the new movement the construction of the new engine must go on hence we return to the previously mentioned negro middle class nmcthe black bourgeoisie as e franklin frazier dubbed them how can we tap the reservoir of technical skills that lie dormant in the nmc can the traditionally aloof and indifferent nmc be drawn into the new engine an unmistakable result of the sporadic revolutions was the terror that gripped the nmc communities the insecurities and vulnerabilities that accompany the social statuses of the nmc were heightened by the fiery demonstrations of the lumpenproletariat the black bourgeoisie has been knocking on the door of white society for decades yet the revolutions found them still pounding frantically for admission the fact that the walls which surround the nmc psyche were shaken is a testimony to the efficacy of the black_power mood indications are that the nmc is no longer sure that its goal of complete assimilation into the white society is realistic or even desirable no less a personality than the president of the national congress of negro women has admonished her convention to cut back on the teas and fashion shows and to get involved in a meaningful way in the problems of the ghetto and even ralph bunche phd has become more willing to identify with the chronic problems of the black community it would appear then that the new mood of black militancythat sanctus spirituo of the new movementis a very powerful mover indeed if we have read the nmc signs of insecurity correctly then we can appeal to them on at least two levels the most basic level is that of enlightened selfinterest the nmc can be shown that their vulnerability is of a dual nature they know only too well that had baldwin hills been located near watts it is probable that the nmc would have suffered both the ravaging strokes of the revolutionists and the savage retaliation of the police forces and the possibility that future riots may spread beyond the ghetto causes the nmc even more discomfort hence this dual vulnerability becomes a wedge by which we can pry them loose from the steppes of pseudowhite society and make them effective components in the new engine of change on another level they can be recruited on the basis of appeals to their desires to be a part of something significant there is undeniable status attached to meaningful activity of any sort and the nmc members seek that status as vigorously as does white society they can be shown that accomplishments in the new movement of black progress can be as personally rewarding as achievements in other spheres of nmc life couple this appeal with the previously given choice of acting or being savagely reacted to and we eventually compel them to drive their long cars right down funky funky broadway where they will emerge trembling and illatease unaware that they have indeed finally arrived as implied in everything that we have said about the nmc and their role in the new engine of change the black community will not accept the nmc as spokesmen for the movement if the cause of dignity of full participation for the black masses is to be promoted with the candor and vigor that is necessary the nmc is hardly qualified to tell it like it is their role must remain that of providing technical assistance to the largely underdeveloped and overexploited black community spokesmen for the new movement will emerge from the black ghetto itself so white society and the nmc should ready themselves to accept these indigenous spokesmen there is no choice the remaining largely untapped source of technical assistance are the expanding numbers of black collegians whounlike the present nmchave been reared under two ideological phases of the movement for black equality they have witnessed the little rocks the impressive march on washington and the selmas and they have seen the old guard of integrationists fall victim to the very goals for which they were strivingassimilation having experienced a far more intimate and sustained encounter with the working of white society than had the older generation these students find the charms of the majority group wholly superficial hypocritical and generally irrelevant black students increasingly reject the notion that everything and anything of value necessarily lies in white society more willing to be critical than their parents black students have proclaimed defunct the integrationassimilation apparatus constructed by earlier engineers of the movement they seek salvation outside the loss of identity of that integration must entail the emergence of allblack organizations on predominantly white campuses and the new surge of black militancy on predominantly black campuses see robert a malsons article on the black_power rebellion at howard university in december negro digest are manifestations of the restive nononsense mood of black collegians finding a heretofore unrecognized common bond of strength that makes for a new esprit de corps black students appear anxious to involve themselves in community projects while some black student groups have found their own projects to work others have been content to let the sanctus spirituo of the new movement drift around the halls of academe like a drunken apparitionelated but anomalous the massiveness of the task and the paucity of black resources necessitate a more economical and efficient use of these black student organizations the skills which they are learningwhether those skills be in business law sociology engineering or whatevercan be readily utilized in the black community if existing programs do not provide the framework within which black student skills can be effectively utilized then it is the duty of the new movement engineers to construct frameworks in new programs equipped with a drive shaft of black engineers the new engine of change is set to propel the new movement in directions which the black community must move ie toward economic and political power the drive will not be an easy one and casualties will occur but for the vision of a better tomorrow the new movement will move ondriven by an indomitable engine of black unity during the last years y n of the life of w e b du bois i had the good fortune to live just a few garden hedges away from the great man and his wife shirley graham every afternoon he insisted on taking a ride through ghanas countryside and occasionally i went with him i never got over my awe of him and i was usually tonguetied in his presence feeling i was sitting not with a mere man but with history sometimes though i summoned enough courage to ask him if he had known this or that black intellectual or political figure from the late th century when he had begun his lifes work usually dr du bois had known the person mentioned and more often than not he would say a very fine man he did very good work but and here he would shake his head sadly he never wrote enough the good doctor believed that a tragic shortcoming of black men of affairs had so often been their failure to leave behind them the written record of what they had done a legacy he knew to be so much more valuable than wealth and property because upon it future generations could plan and build with a knowledge of what their fathers had done today most of us are keenly aware of these shortcomings and the appearance of a new book by a black author is almost always an event to be hailed especially is this true when the book is a work of criticism an area in which we have not yet achieved distinction if its author is a man of mature years whom we know has been a close observer of the scene he describes we open the book with great expectations the crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruses first book begins with such promise it is a thick book nearly pages expensive liberally sprinkled with footnotes and supported by both an index a list of supplementary biographical sources and a postscript on black_power its subject matter plus its impressive production guarantees that it will be a brisk seller especially on college campuses where interest in what black intellectuals are thinking is high but books about them very scarce for these reasons one regrets the painful necessity of having to report that the crisis of the negro intellectual despite its promise and all its builtin advantages is a glaring failure and worse a ship that has sailed into port under false colors it has come not to lead us into serious inquiry about the basic problems facing black intellectuals and black people in general but to destroy the victims of this destructive thrust are not the valid ones of wrong obsolete and untenable ideas and attitudes but a long list of artists and intellectuals many of them dead whom mr cruse happens not to like we have the authors own word for it almost alone of black intellectuals he has kept the flames of black nationalism burning while the rest have been dancing the boogaloo to alien ideologies cruses main thesistrue enough as far as it goes but not at all originalis that there have usually been two political tendencies which have existed in black communities the drive towards full integration and equality in the majority white community as opposed to the separatist black nationalist movements according to cruse the nationalist movements have been continually frustrated by an evil coalition conspiratorial in nature between the whites of the communist party and a succession of notsobright black writers acting as willing or duped agents of the communists among these agents he manages to include nearly every black writer who has published a book or had a play produced since mr cruse himself began his long apprenticeship as an author it may seem unkind to suggest that the author has labored over this long work primarily to settle old scores with more successful colleagues but even a casual glance at his table of contents and index makes this conclusion inescapable for example the life of du bois spanned nearly years he wrote so much that no library in the world has succeeded in compiling a complete bibliography of his works he was unquestionably the greatest intellectual ever produced by black america and outside his own country he is generally recognized as one of the great western thinkers a product of the age before specialization his work ranged over a large number of disciplines and arts from philosophy psychology sociology and history at the one end to journalism novels and poetry at the other he was not only the father but the grandfather of us all and his impact on the black american whether intellectual or not was so profound that we all bear his stamp it goes without saying that any author purporting to seriously analyze the crisis of black intellectuals throughout american history must devote major attention to such a giant how then can one explain that there is an entire chapter devoted to the crucifixion of the late lorraine hansberry author of two plays a raisin in the sun and the sign in sidney brusteins window while there is no chapter on du bois of course mr cruse must refer to the old man but there are only references to du bois while there are to a young woman whose artistic life tragically spanned less than five years although lorraine was not noted for maidenly modesty she would have been the first to protest that cruse was giving her too much attention and she would have been too kind to draw the conclusion that what really bothered her critic was not her ideological peculiarities but the tremen dous commercial success achieved by her play a raisin in the sun to be fair mr cruse may have some justification for the dislike of miss hansberry at the height of her success mr cruse asked her to read a musical play he had written presumably with the idea that she as a new celebrity and rolling in bread might help him get it on the boards lorraine with characteristic candor declined the honor of reading it saying she didnt know anything about musicals as a fellow writer i can imagine how annoyed cruse must have been for just now i have a play knocking around which i know is the greatest thing written since will shakespeare checked out but even some of my socalled best friends persist in being jackasses by stubbornly disagreeing with me and i am considering devoting a chapter to each one of them in my next book many of the new militants are excited about the cruse book and impatient with greybeards like this reviewer who refuses to confine himself to the issues raised within the book naturally the new militants want to get on with it and like most of todays students are not much interested in anything that happened before they got out of high school but to concentrate only on the issues would be as simpleminded as to confine a discussion of the johnson war in vietnam to mr johnsons latest state of the union message in the book as in the message there are so many distortions spiteful inferences and downright lies that serious intellectual exchange becomes impossible because we are forced to speculate on the basic honesty and integrity of the author there are plenty of eyewitnesses to the murderous fiasco being acted out in asia but the ranks of those who were present at some of the events mr cruse describes are thinning and it is imperative that while a few of us are still about we set the record straight for example it is impossible to understand many of the postworld war ii events in harlem the clash of ideology between black and white marxists on the one hand and the black nationalists on the other unless one understands the vital role cruse himself played in these events yet the author after describing nearly everybody else as a ccc cardcarrying communist especially personalities who might be harmed by the charge shows a strange reluctance to appear on stage himself to anyone who doesnt know writers such reticence may at first seem admirable but the rest of us detect a peculiar and not very pleasant smell so lets take a closer look at the chapter origins of the dialogue cruse describes how in august the harlem writers club a dissident group which had split with the more orthodox marxistoriented committee for the negro in the arts demanded that the harlem political left wing establish a harlem cultural commission to oversee the complicated and aggravated situation in the community the rejected strain of nationality consciousness was in conflict with the integrationist trend over community cultural policies backed to the hilt by the party line this heated battle was carried into the communist partys harlem headquarters by the chairman of the club myself that is to say cruse and the cochairman unless the reader actually knows he may get the idea that this is a confrontation between black nationalists and communists with cruse a lonely churchillian figure arguing for black autonomy from the backbenches but it isnt that at all this is an intracommunist party struggle which could only have occurred between communists for why on earth would a dedicated group of black nationalists seek the permission of the interracial communist party to operate in harlem where presumably they the black nationalists would have deeper roots and greater strength this is where the question of honesty comes in at no point does mr cruse tell his readers what they have a right to know what indeed all of us who were there already know certainly it is no secret from the interested intelligence agencies of the federal government from whom presumably mr cruse is not now seeking employment this knowledge is that in he was an upandcoming marxist theoretician not a black nationalist and not a mere rankandfiler like the rest of us i can remember how we youngsters looked up to him because he functioned on a policymaking level speaking from a background of such authority cruse could no doubt tell us more than he has in his book and the average reader would understand how he came to know so much as we have already decided i hope not prematurely that cruse is not bucking for a job in washington my only conclusion is that he wants to be sure he is in step with the younger militants by establishing a background that he has always been antiwhite and antiintegrationist if i am right this is a great pity for there is no reason for any black intellectual of mr cruses age to be ashamed of the fact that he once believed in the possibility of american social and political regeneration which could be achieved by something less than total revolution men are not born revolutionaries nearly always they become that long after they have considered attempted and finally abandoned every other option i think it is a healthy development that militant black youths set the pace today but it ought to be generally recognized that the world they are determined to change was not created in and that they and their conclusions are the end products of several generations of struggle and development thus it seems to this reviewer that mr cruse ought to be proud of the fact that in the late forties he was among the first of the young blacks to challenge white power in the american communist party the fact that he did not at the time coin the slogan black_power is no mark against him catchy phrases seem to drop from heaven franklin roosevelts ringing declaration that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself is said to have been lifted bodily from a macys department store advertisement mr cruse and some of his friends were among the first to recognize that the party slogan negro and white unity was inconsistent with the realities of the black community by this i mean that the ideal of the u s communist party of uniting under one banner black and white urban and rural workers was simply beyond realization because it did not take into account the profound and qualitative importance of race in the american situation that the most miserable white considered himself the superior of the most accomplished black that in a time of crisis the whites would be bound to throw in their lot with the white power structure and that blacks had to be organized as blacks under black direction these conclusions which seem so obvious now were a long time in the making spanning several generations and my only point here is that if one happens to have been unfortunate enough to have been a gleam in his daddys eye in the twenties instead of the forties he has nothing to be ashamed of especially if he played an honorable part in the development of black political thought here is the rub here again is where the knowledge of what actually happened on a personality level prevents this reviewer from considering only the issues raised in the book and forces him to question the motives of the author at the time to which we are referring mr cruse had written a play im sure it was a very fine play but the left wing offbroadway theater groups which were the only ones encouraging black writers then had all turned it down naturally the aspiring playwright was very bitter understandably so and a reviewer in cant help but wonder whether or not the authors current and bitter antimarxism is not more personal than ideological otherwise how are we to explain these contradictions that in when he was leading an anticommunist black nationalist struggle he was at the same time asking the white communistcontrolled theatre groups to produce his play that more than a decade after lorraine hansberry as cruse implies revealed herself to be hopelessly integrationist and a puppet of the white marxists he was asking her to lend her name prestige and money in support of his musical play these questions far from being petty probably reveal the wellsprings of the book a phenomenon of our age is that men trapped in the rush of events are frequently forced to hide or denounce the noblest acts of their lives thus people who understood the growing threat of world fascism in the nineteenthirties are hesitant about acknowledging that they once supported the republican cause in spain and some of the men who took up guns and went away to risk their lives in the faraway hills near barcelona and madrid are ashamed to admit it today because the prevailing american attitude is that it was all a communist plot yet those were to use the maudlin phrase the best years of their lives it is a curious twist of history that middleaged black men should also hide their past ideological commitments for they have nothing to gain by it except the contempt of their colleagues and of their white enemies who could not care less what these blacks did or years ago in the crisis of the negro intellectual the author frequently calls attention to apparent contradictions in positions taken by w e b du bois inexplicably writes cruse on page he dubois joined in the decimated ranks of the american communist partya violent aboutface for a man who had spent the s and the s rejecting communism and again on page the reason that the debate on black economy has gone back and forth for years with no conclusions reached is because the idea is closely linked with nationalism and the integrationists would rather be tarred and feathered than suspected of the nationalist taint this was the great weakness of w e b du boisthe only real flaw in the mans intellectual equipment du bois upheld the idea of a separate black economy as not so easily dismissed because in the first place we have already got a partially separate economy in the united states yet he remarked in that his economic program for negro advance can easily be mistaken for a program of complete racial segregation and even nationalism among negroes this is a misapprehension if one can so completely miss the point about the greatest black intellectual whose thoughts are mostly gathered in libraries available to cruse there is small wonder that he is constantly off the beam about lesser mortals a man who lived from to and whose entire productive life was concerned with the advancement of his people might very well be expected to have changed his mind frequently far be it for me to remind mr cruse of the philosophers admonition that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds the du bois odyssy spreads over the entire history of the united states since the first civil war which ended in he was neither an integration nor a black nationalist he was too great a genius to be encompassed under petty labels all of his prodigious energies were devoted to bringing the human race especially the ethnic section of it to which he belonged from darkness into light he was never a man of fashion and it would not have bothered him for one moment that a position he had taken on monday turned out to be wrong on tuesday he would simply have changed his position for he was in the best sense of the word a social scientist who drew his conclusions from all of the available hard evidence fully cognizant as the genuine scientists are that todays conclusions may be proved false by tomorrows discoveries du bois never claimed to have found a solution to the economic problems of the black man in the united states economics was not one of his disciplines and even if it had been in all probability he would have failed to anticipate as did all the master thinkers of his time the nations incredible technological achievement that would dislocate the traditional relation ship between labor and production and make the black worker and not a small number of white workers not only unwanted but obsolete this development alone not to mention the concurrent and related worldwide expansion of the american empire creates profound and complex problems for those attempting to chart the future of the black man in the united states happily mr cruse is keenly aware of the implications of these developments and reveals himself at his intellectual best in the chapter capitalism revisited where he offers a devastating analysis of the economic philosophy of the black bourgeoisie as represented by businessman hope stevens and the ultraconservative journalist george s schuyler who has never forgiven roosevelt for the new deal quite rightly mr cruse calls to our attention the best if limited contribution that du bois made in the area of economics in his autobiography dust of dawn where in the words of cruse du bois outlined a whole new concept of what he called the cooperative commonwealth for the american negro yet this very important aspect of du boiss thinking is never even mentioned today by the various black intellectual worshippers of the du bois tradition cruses main contribution in this chapter is to call attention to the poverty of serious analysis of the black mans economic situation by writers and politicians of either the left or the right as the reader may have gathered my reaction to the crisis of the negro intellectual has been mostly negative and i welcome the opportunity to applaud a section of the book in this chapter serious inquiry replaces the settling of old grudges and mr cruses prowess in the area of economics suggests that he may have a good deal more to offer certainly we need all the help we can get elsewhere in the book mr cruse makes another positive contribution when he calls attention to our unhealthy tendency to worship and praise our heroes and spokesmen uncritically the best of our leaders and the cause of liberation would have been better served had all of them been subjected to searching analysis of the quality mr cruse calls for in his book like most men who have lived full lives du bois probably did a lot of things he would not want to take any credit for today after dinner with him one evening in accra i was in the process of making some rather angry remarks about roy wilkins who i believe is still the executive secretary of the naacp i have forgotten what idiotic act prompted my emotional outburst but i recall very vividly that the old man held up his hand and asked me to keep quiet i wanted to know what right w e b du bois had to curtail julian mayfields freedom of speech he explained that it made him feel guilty to hear me attack roy wilkins for in the s he du bois had been responsible for bringing mr wilkins a middle western journalist to the attention of the naacp hierarchy in new york i was astounded for all i knew about his relations with roy wilkins was that the younger man had dropped du bois when the whites in washington had decided finally and forever that they didnt like him i apologized for speaking angrily against mr wilkins and sought to console the good doctor after all said if it should turn out that dr du bois and i were both wrong and that there was indeed a heaven somewhere st peter would probably forgive w e b du bois for the wilkins error even the greatest of men make mistakes the point of this story is that there is nothing in the life which has been honestly lived that should be ignored if history happens to take any account of you i dont of course mean petty things but those aspects of your life that touch on your work if a man like du bois could confess that he was responsible for bringing roy wilkins to new york then certainly people like cruse and myself ought to have the guts to admit to murder or rape backing the cause of racial integration and the correction of social injustice whether the victim is white or black may be unfashionable and uncle tomish now but there was a time not so long ago when it was downright dangerous as i approach the age of forty i dont want to blot out many of my most cherished experiences merely to seem current or camp i dont regret that i was at least a face in the protesting crowds a signature on petitions and finally a mourner at the funeral during the crucible of julius and ethel rosenberg not for a moment do i feel regret that with hundreds of others i trudged around the white house with my miserable signs protesting the death sentences passed on the martinsville seven black boys condemned for the rape of a white woman in virginia willie mcgee executed for raping a white woman or the trenton six whose alleged crime i dont remember mindless and emotional some of this may seem to those who stood aloof but i like to think that we would still pile into cars and speed headlong up to the peekskill riots to challenge incipient american fascism which was trying to prevent paul robeson from giving a concert not for anything would i trade the ugly and bizarre memory of watching peekskills negro elks standing between the local ku klux klan and the american legion all of them shouting at us to go back to russia where we came from it was good to be alive then and committed to the ideal of destroying political and social injustice just as it is now mr cruse would have us believe that the reds and the integrationists conspired in the destruction of the american negro theater ant and that the principal instruments of this destruction were the actors who deserted for the greenerlooking fields downtown such an assertion is transparently ridiculous i recall those days very well and no black actor in the country was so busy that he could not have accepted engagements uptown and across town and still have had time to spare there just werent that many roles available as there arent now except for a few individuals moreover anyone who has been on the periphery of the theatre as long as mr cruse has ought to know that there is never a shortage of actors playwrights and producers yes actors never but let us assume for the sake of argument that mr cruse is correct that the departure of certain actors had a disastrous effect on cn awhat was to prevent those who remained from carrying on or even organizing a new theatre you certainly didnt need communist party permission or money to operate in harlem in those days all you needed was faith in a play the will to try and plenty of elbow grease maxie glanville ossie davis and i embarked on disastrous theatrical ventures more than once the intrepid gertrude jeanette was practically a onewoman company writer producing and directing her own plays writer loften mitchell was the busiest legit theaterperson in harlem neither asking nor needing the permission of anyone to write produce direct and fail as we all did actressplaywright alice childress had a number of plays produced in little theaters one of them florence is i believe a permanent addition to our literature as actors and writers we worked on broadway and off way downtown and way uptown wherever we could find work and get training in our crafts we lost every penny we could beg or borrow but at least a few plays got done some of them not without artistic merit it is now nearly years since the collapse of the american negro theatre surely within this time mr cruse and his associates could have come up with a play hired a hall called the actors together and put it on however if this thought has occurred to them there is no evidence of it but except for his chapter capitalism revisited mr cruse is not concerned with constructive effort he is clearly out to settle scores with those who it seems to him have made it up the ladder apparently at his expense thus of this impressive number of hopefuls in ant only a small handful are around today to boast of some success in the theatreruby dee ossie davis sidney poitier alice childress maxwell glanville harry belafonte and frederick oneal interestingly enough with the exception of oneal all these survivors found their pathway to later prominence in the integrated theatre through the harlem political left wings cruse even professes to see something sinister in the fact that some of these people later worked together the left wing cultural forces had moved into postwar prominence sidney poitier was soon to be seen on the stages of a theatre operated by cna the committee for the negro in the arts he was also featured offbroadway in longitude written by a white left wing playwright some ten years later poitier along with ruby dee and later ossie davis were stars of lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun it is hardly coincidence that to this day the names of poitier davis dec and others repeatedly turn up in juxtaposition what are we to make of such a statement is it paranoia or simple ignorance of show business realities that the names of davis and dee repeatedly turn up in juxtaposition should surprise no one they follow the same profession and have been married to one another for nearly years and surely harold cruse knows that no black actor not even academy awardwinning poitier and only a handful of white superstars are in a position to make basic decisions in the motion picture or television industries that the very nature of commercial show business in our system requires that the producer think first of the biggest names he can get if he is to be able to raise the money to make his picture or get his show on the boards and that the fact that there are so few black actors of any prominence makes it inevitable that they will appear together over and over again if it is all a left wing conspiracy as the author suggests we must be prepared to believe that the great banks of wall street are involved in it for it is they who ultimately determine what pictures are made for the mass media like mr cruse i envy those who have made a bundle of money and won fame in the business to which i once aspired but as a student of the american system he should understand that they are no more to blame for their success than they are for his failure such a system will never permit the emergence of more than a limited number of firstclass black talents and that is why over the generations we have lost so many brilliant artists who simply had to give up because there was no place for them the crisis of the negro intellectual is a long book and an adequate review of it would have to be about as long for on almost every page and in almost every footnote there are distortions malevolent misinterpretations andit must be saidoutright lies in the rest of my space i can call attention to only a few of these concentrating on matters about which i have personal knowledge unfortunately i wasnt born when claude mckay was working on his poem if we must die and it never occurred to me until read this book to wonder if the poem had been written under the influence of the communist party but apparently this is a question of inexhaustible fascination for mr cruse and on page after dreary page he offers extensive documentation on the communist connections of every major and minor black figure in literature the number of people on mr cruses crap list is inexhaustible and includes an entire ethnic group west indians whom the author holds largely responsible for the downfall of marcus garvey himself a son of the islands the inestimable enrichment of afroamerican culture and intellectuality by west indians amounts to nothing in mr cruses eyes because some of them had the good sense to read and be influenced by the ideas of karl marx shooting from the hip the author draws his pistols and fires two chapters one at west indians in general and the other at richard b moore now an elderly bookshop keeper in harlem who was a socialist as far back as and according to cruse a founder of the american communist party to make matters worse he is also a west indian this reviewer with the historian john henrik clarke novelist john o killens and political leader robert f williams come in for special attention from mr cruse the author reminds me that in i interviewed miss ruby dee for the newspaper freedom and that i neglected to ask her why she left the american negro theatre in that happens to be the year i was graduated from high school and fully two years before i ever heard of miss dee or ant his inference is that her departure was part of the red integrationist plot to destroy ant that is of course a possibility but isnt it more likely that she left broadway for the same reason that mr cruse took his book downtown to a white publisher there are hardly any black publishers just as until recently there was not a single black producing company that could offer anything but occasional work to black actors one should also remember that in miss dee was hardly a star and wonderful actress though she is there was no reason why a healthy theatre company should have collapsed just because she left on page mr cruse claims he visited the offices of freedom and left with a feeling of desolation and angry disgust at the cliquish remoteness from changing reality that pervaded this newspaper one could plainly see that its writers were intellectual prisoners of the dying left wing movement dutifully and blindly obeying the mandate to hang on but at the same time they were preparing for their own grand exit into the integrated cultural world and what in fact could one expect the sentiments of killens hansberry dee mayfield clarke and company to bewhen the great intellectual scholar dr w e b du bois had given his official sanction to freedom newspaper in miss hansberry was just over years old and very junior at freedom none of the rest of the company he mentions was ever on the staff of freedom though the writers among us might have contributed an occasional article but here the wary reader will ask himself what was harold cruse doing at the office of freedom in the first place this is three years after the ant betrayal the newspaper is marxistoriented and on the staff are a number of people who mr cruse knows to be hopelessly committed to the cause of integration why is he there among the enemy the answer is partly obvious like the rest of us struggling writers he has taken his manuscript to wherever there was a chance of getting it printed and the editors of freedom have been shortsighted enough to reject yet another cruse creation no wonder he left with a feeling of desolation and angry disgust every rejection slip affects me the same way to harold cruse the selfdefense movement of robert f williams in monroe north carolina was a monumental fiasco unquestionably he is right if he means that we did not win our ultimate objective which was to gain more power for the blacks of union county and that some were forced to flee the country if victory could be vouchsafed to militants our ranks would no doubt be overflowing on the other hand if young black militants have any idea that mr cruse as critic represents the wave of the future that he is a sort of latterday frantz fanon they had better read page where he reveals that he is now just as terrified of whiteys power as he has been over the last two decades no vision of the proletarian revolution whether in mayfields black tones or in white leftist tones can seriously project overthrowing the federal structure it is so powerfully big that even the conservative right wing is worried to the point of extreme apoplexy the cumulative effect of the charges mr cruse levels against the present reviewer is that i have not yet succeeded in formulating a comprehensive ideology of struggle for black americans of course he is absolutely correct i dont want to quibble but neither has he formulated such an ideology and as a writer he has had many more years in which to accomplish this than i have i have left the cuban experience until last because the incident is to me the key to what makes harold cruse run it is july and a group of american writers are guests of the revolutionary government in the sierra maestra among the writers are john henrik clarke cruse leroi jones and myself for weeks fidel and his comrades have exhorted the cuban people to make a pilgrimage to these mountains from which he launched his revolution the target number to make the pilgrimage is but the new government does not expect that many people and has made no plans to get them off the mountains however there is an euphoria over cuba and the people take fidel at his words weeks before the july th celebration they begin to make their way up the roads to the mountains nearly a million people a sixth of the entire population are there posing a monumental problem for the young leaders who have underestimated their own popularity when the celebration is over the narrow roads are jammed and the single railroad taxed far beyond its capacity because everyone is trying to leave at the same time there is hardly any food or water and to make matters worse the carbine of a young militiaman has been accidentally discharged and shot up the main water pump so everybody is hot dirty hungry and thirsty despite the use of helicopters and trucks screaming up and down the roads it remains an almost impossible task to meet the gastronomic and sanitation needs of so many people guests of the government are taken care of first but still there is considerable inconvenience and discomfort because there is nothing to do about it john henrik clarke and i go off to search for a place to sleep having found an abandoned oldsmobile of about vintage and made our beds we return to the mess hall to find a riot in the making of all the delegations from a score of nations only one of them is creating a disturbance and it is to our shame the north americans the chief spokesman of the delegation is harold cruse and his two subalterns are very pale young white women all of whom are screaming at the harassed cuban aide assigned to us that they are starving to death and dying of thirst the profuse apologies of the poor aide whose command of english is practically nil are of no avail the fact that half a million people in these mountains are experiencing the same discomfiture has no impression on cruse and then i hear him the black nationalist cruse backed up by the two white women scream at the cuban youd damn well better get us something to eat and drink or ill go back to the states and write the worst things i can think of about you and your damned revolution i wrote down these words of cruse before i went to sleep that night and before reporting them here i have checked them against the recollection of others who were there the man who screamed that blackmail threat merely for food and water is the author of the crisis of the negro intellectual the political pundit who presumes to sit in moral judgment on almost every black person who has written and published a book a play or a poem i often disagreed with my friend lorraine hansberry and i still have differences with the american communist party which may one day be reconciled but there is one thing for which i shall never forgive either of them and that is that on the two occasions i have mentioned they did not help to produce harold cruses plays if they had he too might have become rich and famous that is he might have got his ration of food and water and we might have been spared this spiteful book james weldon johnson who was poet diplomat and j y civil_rights leader was also mentor to many young writers of the literary renaissance of harlem one of his friends was claude mckay a young jamaican poet of promise whom johnson met in mckay like some other artists of that era went into exile abroad it was while mckay was working with max eastman as an associate editor and drama critic for the liberator that he had the unpardonable experience that no doubt climaxed his growing disenchantment with america he and an artist friend attended a new york play opening as part of the invited guests and the press corps the usher who was supported by the manager refused to seat mckay in the press box although not a member of the communist party but certainly interested in communism and the recent russian revolution of mckay decided to go to russia it was james weldon johnson who helped him make financial arrangements for the trip that took him to various parts of europe and eventually to morocco johnson gave a gala farewell party at his harlem residence for mckay and guests included many of the black literary personages of that era mckay describes his colorful experiences abroad in his autobiography a long way from home in a chapter entitled hail and farewell to morocco he brings the reader up to that phase of his life when he decides to return to the united states it is interesting to note that mckay gives very little information about his decision to reum especially since his citizenship was periled there is evidence that it was johnson who played a major role in persuading mckay to return to harlem johnson wrote in a letter to max eastman that mckay does seem to be anxious to come back to the united states we know that johnson even went to washington d c to speak to officials at the department of state concerning mckays return in the same letter to eastman johnson stated that he had secured a copy of home to harlem and sent it to the assistant secretary of state with whom i had the conference regarding claude i sent it backing up my statements to him regarding claudes literary status the following three documents are interesting sidelights in that they answer some questions about claude mckay the proletarian poetnovelist and james weldon johnson the creative and genteel black american both men lived in an era of great social upheavals that are now significant historical events january my dear mr mckay i have just written a little biographical sketch of you for harper and brothers for bringing out your book they are going to send me a copy as soon as the book is off the press i am very anxious to see it and i hope it is going to have quite a sale i have been wanting to write you for some time i should like very much if you were back in the states in fact right in new york you ought to be here to take full advantage of the great wave of opportunity that negro literary and other artists are enjoying in additionwe need you to give more strength and solidity to the whole movement i wish you would think about coming back and if i can in any way be of any assistance whatever please do not hesitate to call on me with kindest regards i am his nigger was never supposed to learn how to write but he did and eldridge cleaver in the infancy of his new groove is already performing dearly needed surgery on this sickest of nations with his higher uneducation brother eldridge in soul on ice mcgrawhill cuts through all the nooks and crannies where hide the desperate secrets of the american madness to the essay cleaver brings scholarship passion and a freewheeling turnyouon style and not even the polemist hunters can deny the literary achievement in his works leroi jones reminded an audience of the way white gym teachers used to tell black youngsters to quit dribbling and shooting the basketball so fancy imploring them to do it natural but that was natural for you you know said jones likewise with cleavers prose we should know by now that eldridge cleaver was for some years a prisoner having been busted for getting caught with a shopping bag full of love in this land where youre only supposed to get high the way the crooks get high and for being a rapist cleaver just as certainly as he knows the one was not a crime knows that the other was and in his writing explores that experience including his motivations concluding that he had gone astray not so much from the white mans law as from being human civilized even the smallest insight into america reveals her extraordinary absence of depth blindness where there ought to be vision tradition where the need is imagination and the form of delusion that assumes longevity to be experience cleaver the fortunate victim of circumstances that forced him to get to himself in the process peeped the card of the populace this surgeon is not content to carelessly bandage the little cuts that irritate us into a more awesome fascism but instead takes his knife and cuts all the way to the ass where everybody says the pain is and brings to the surface even the secret secrets one has no choice but to witness his terrifying depth blowing away the puritan left in thee and rejoice for having discovered this youthful trailblazer who is as fresh as the next young girl who smiles your way and as wise as the school board decided we would never be they will accuse indeed they already have brother eldridge of being hungup on sexof course not once realizing that they have accused him of being hungup on lifewhich is only the logical course for those who so skillfully created a god that disdains the act of love reading cleaver and the murder of jesus christ by wilhelm reich at the same time it is impossible to believe that the two did not communicate for they both the essayist and the psychiatrist the black man and the white man shared that liberating knowledge of the connection between mans and womans inability to function as whole sexual units and their helpless succumbing to the fatal mandate of the warlords cleaver could have as easily quoted reich as norman mailer in his assertion that the upper classes exchange sex for power in his brilliant essay the primeval mitosis cleaver scientifically examines that which underlies the white man s having rendered himself sexless and given to the black man all such powerswhich of course makes the destruction of that power ie black man essential to his own frank james jesse james l b james supremacy of the universe cleaver believes as poetsociologist calvin hernton opined at a new york conference a few years back that a good piece would go a long long way to more good pieces perhaps notes on a native son is without question one of the more important critical looks at james baldwin however much it might affront the sensibility of the baldwin lovers and it does at first struck by baldwins power at combining the alphabet with the volatile elements of his soul cleaver allows that he was among we brothers who lusted for everything that came out of baldwins mind but suddenly he finds himself appalled by what he calls baldwins shameful fanatical fawning sycophantic love of the whites he speaks with more sensitivity than did sylvester leaks a few years ago of baldwins hatred for blacks which was of course rather obvious in his earliest writingsalthough neither cleaver nor this reviewer recognized it as such at first because and sometimes cleaver seems to avoid this horrible truth our love for black people was still rather dubiousand gradually gets to what really outrages him baldwins quarrels with norman mailer and richard wright and baldwins homosexuality while one accepts that the homosexual is offcenter which is perhaps taking a gutless position one must tell an otherwise perceptive cleaver to go straight to hell with that crap that would equate baldwin with the white mans most valuable tool in oppressing other blacks believing that men do not simply become homosexuals any more than they simply become prisoners one is quick to wonder if perhaps the power in baldwin which cleaver honors is as much the product of his experiences as is eldridges own one grows tired of being reminded that baldwin hated black people because they failed to produce rembrandt because one thinks that that favorite cliche of his critics has lost validity except as an historical reference do we really believe that baldwin because of our image of him has not grown and are we convinced he has grown less than those of us who indulge in the kind of emptiness that rewards us with a womandespising manhood some of us hate ourselves because we cannot find a meaningful relationship with a woman and because we are addicted to heterosexuality are doomed to the familiar wandering and frustration we get plentyof what cleaver talks about baldwins contradictions and giving reason to believe that he understands the value of meaningful relationships between man and woman it seems rather a contradiction that he could dismiss baldwins essay on andre gide with out confessing that it was instructive for him in terms of his own manhood cleaver on baldwin is penetrating consuming and not without the ambiguity one comes upon in the best of art but it leaves you feeling that he saved his most vicious screams for the man he really loves as indeed he should which says something else about eldridge cleaver something beautiful and one can only hope to someday read baldwin on cleaver eldridge the ofay watcher is another gas ofay watchers anonymous we might be called because we exist concealed in the shadows wherever colored people have known oppression by whites he writes before putting together a compact but full treatise on the crimes of the american white man and the lifestyle grown out of those crimes black nationalist cleaver ironically brings seldom observed insight into the dilemma of the young whites who would be caught up in the web of blueeyed lies that is their inheritance and in spite of his militant friends who dont yet understand that what made the beast a beast can make others beasts which has nothing to do really with reverse racism that jive term cleaver is courageous enough to not save for an easier time his understanding that all that black those young folk are getting next to will also blow blue eyes out of this patch in the pasture which reminds me that one afternoon in a tv studio i watched brother cleaver take notes and found it hard to believe he was the same cat whose writings had turned me not just on but loose there was something going on in his head that i naturally then could not see but we should all see and eldridge knows it and he would help us what more can you say about a brothers work david llorens rannie toomers little baby boy snooks was dying from double pneumonia and whooping cough she sat away from him looking into the low fire her long crusty bottom lip hanging she was not married was not pretty was not anybody much and he was all she had lawd why dont that doctor come on here she moaned into the fire tears sliding out of her sticky eyes she had not washed since snooks took sick five days ago and a long row of whitish snail tracks laced her ashen face what you ought to try is some of the old home remedies sarah urged she was an old neighbor lady who wore magic leaves round her neck sewed up in possum skin next to a dried lizards foot she knew how magic came about and could do magic herself people said we going to have us a doctor rannie toomer walked over and shooed a fat winter fly from her childs forehead i dont believe in none of that swamp magic she said all the old home remedies i took when i was a child just come short of killing me snooks under a pile of faded quilts made a small gravelike mound in the bed his head was like a ball of black putty wedged between the thin covers and the dingy yellow pillow his little eyes were partly open as if he were peeping out of his hard wasted skull at the chilly room and the forceful pulse of his breathing caused a faint rustling in the sheets near his mouth like the wind pushing damp papers in a shallow ditch what time you reckon that white doctorll git here asked sarah emphasizing the doctors color and trying to catch the childs breathing above the wind outside not expecting rannie toomer to answer her she sat with her old knees wide apart under many apron tails and long dark skirts heavy with stains from time to time she reached long cracked fingers down to sweep her damp skirts away from the live coals it was almost spring but the winter cold still clung to her bones and she had to almost sit in the fireplace to be warm her deep sharp eyes set in the rough leather of her face had aged a moist hesitant blue that gave her a quick dull stare like a hawk if she had ever lost faith in magic nobody knew about it for nobody could remember old sarah without her roots and dead cats she just appeared suddenly when something strong was needed the greatest piece of magic in itself some said that they had ever seen now she gazed coolly at rannie toomer and rapped the hearth stones with her stick white mailman white doctor she chanted darkly under her breath as if to banish spirits they gotta come see bout this baby rannie toomer said wistfully whod go and ignore a little sick baby like my snooks she asked some folks we dont know so well as we thinks we do might the old lady replied what you want to give that boy of yours is one or two of the old home remedies arrowsroot or sassyfrass and cloves or a sugar tit soaked in cats blood rannie toomers face went tight we dont need none of your witchs remedies she cried grasping her baby by his shrouded toes trying to knead life into him like she kneaded limberness into flour dough we going to git some of them shots that makes peoples well curesem of all they ails cleansem out and makesem strong all at the same time she spoke upward from her sons feet as if he were an altar doctorll be here soon baby she whispered to him then rose to look out the grimy window i done sent the mailman she rubbed her face against the glass her flat nose more flattened as she peered out into the rain rannie toomer had gone down to the mailbox in the rain that morning hoping she hadnt missed the mailmans car she had watched from across the pasture since seven although she knew it wouldnt be along until a few minutes after ten like it always was she sat down on an old milk can that had been abandoned near the mailbox and turned her drooping face in the direction the mailmans car would come she had no umbrella and her coat was as thin and as short as a denim blouse her feet shivered inside thin clear plastic shoes that let in water and mud finally she saw him coming howde rannie mae the redfaced mailman said pleasantly as he always did when she stood by the car waiting to ask him something usually she wanted to ask what certain circulars meant that showed pretty pictures of things she needed did the circulars mean that somebody was coming around later and give her hats and suitcases and shoes and sweaters and rubbing alcohol and a heater for the house and a fur bonnet for her baby or why did he always give her the pictures if she couldnt have what was in them or what did the words say especially the big word written in red sale he would explain shortly to her that the only way she could get the goods pictured on the circulars was to buy them in town and that town stores did their advertising by sending out pictures of their goods she would listen with her mouth hanging open until he finished then she would exclaim in a dull amazed way that she never had any money and he could ask anybody she couldnt ever buy any of the things in the picturesso why did the stores keep sending them to her he tried to explain to her that everybody got the circulars whether they had any money to buy with or not that this was one of the laws of advertising and he could not do anything about it he was sure she never understood what he tried to teach her about advertising for one day she asked him for any extra circulars he had and when he asked her what she wanted them forsince she couldnt afford to buy any of the items advertised she said she needed them to paper the inside of her house to keep out the wind today he thought she looked more ignorant than usual as she stuck her dripping head inside his car waiting for him to take away her dumbness and stupidity he recoiled from her breath before it reached him and gave little attention to what she was saying about her sick baby as he mopped up the water she dripped on the plastic door handle of the car well never can keepem dry i mean warm enough in rainy weather like this here he mumbled absently stuffing a wad of circulars advertising hairdryers and cold creams into her hands he wished she would stand back from his car so he could get going but she clung to the side gabbing away about snooks and newmonia and shots and how she wanted a real doctor to everything she said he nodded that right he injected sympathetically from time to time and from time to time he sneezed for she was letting in wetness and damp and he felt he was coming down with a cold black people as black as rannie toomer always made him uneasy especially when they didnt smell good and when you could tell they didnt right away rannie mae leaning in over him out of the rain smelled like a wet goat her dark dirty eyes clinging to his face with such hungry desperation made him nervous why did colored folks always want you to do something for them one of the reasons he had not wanted to take this job as rural mailman was because he would have to talk to colored people who never seemed to understand that it wasnt the mailmans duty to fetch doctors and deliver babies and set splints and take care of any other mizries they might have now he cleared his throat and made a motion as if to roll up his window well ah mighty sorry to hear bout that little fella he said groping for the window crank well see what we can do he gave her what he hoped was a big friendly smile god he didnt want to hurt her feelings she looked so pitiful hanging there in the rain suddenly he had an idea whynt you try some of old aunt sarahs home remedies he suggested brightly still smiling he halfbelieved with everybody else in the county that the old blueeyed black woman possessed magic magic that if it didnt work on whites probably would on blacks but rannie toomer almost turned the car over shaking her head and body with an emphatic no she reached in a wet crusted hand to grasp his shoulder we wants us a doctor a real doctor she screamed she had begun to cry and drop her tears on him you git us a doctor from town she bellowed shaking the solid shoulder that bulged under his warm coat like i say he drawled lamely although beginning to be furious with her well do what we can and he hurriedly rolled up the window and sped down the road cringing from the thought that she had put her nasty black hands on him old home remediesold home remedies rannie toomer had cursed the words while she licked at the hot tears that ran down her face the only warmth about her she turned backwards to the trail that led to her house trampling the wet circulars under her feet under the fence she went and was in a pasture surrounded by dozens of fat whitefolks cows and an old gray horse and a mule or two animals lived there in the pasture all around her house and she and snooks lived in it old sarah dug steadily at the fire the bones in her legs ached like they were sitting through a windy day outside the flesh that encased them white mailman white doctor white doctor white mailman she chanted from time to time putting the poker down carefully and rubbing her shins the young ones will turn to them she said when it is us olduns what got the power whynt you git away from that draff there by the winder she asked rannie toomer she had put together something hot in a dish and was drinking it from between cupped palms making her hands warm you going to catch your death of cold standing there looking for that white doctor that aint coming nohow he is coming too rannie toomer said angrily she wondered why she had bothered to let in the old woman when she came hobbling across the pasture to her m a a m a a a a door it was less than an hour after she had talked to the mailman that she looked up expecting the doctor and saw old sarah tramping through the grass on her walking stick she couldnt pretend she wasnt home with the smoke climbing out the chimney so she let her in making her leave her bag of tricks on the front porch old woman old as that ought to forgit trying to cure other people with her nigger magic ought to use some of it on herself she thought rannie would not let her lay a finger on snooks and warned the old woman if she tried anything she would knock her over the head with her own cane he coming alright rannie toomer said firmly looking straining her eyes to see through the rain let me tell you child the old woman said almost gently sipping from her dish he aint rannie toomer had not let her near the boy on the bed since she came in and that had made her angry but now she looked at the calloused bare heels of the young woman and smiled sadly marking the rejection of herself and the often queer fact that the young always grow up hoping when would this one know she mused that she could only depend on those who would come she thought the time was near across the room she had begun to pace but i told you rannie toomer said in exasperation i asked the mailman to bring a doctor for my snooks cold wind was shooting all around her from the cracks in the window framing faded circulars blew inward from the walls the old womans gloomy prediction made her tremble he done fetched the doctor the old woman said rubbing her dish with her hand what you reckon brung me over here in this here floodwont no desire to see no rainbows i can tell you rannie toomer paled s the doctor child the old woman turned to rannie with dull wise eyes that there white mailman didnt get no further with that message of yours then the road in front of my house lucky he got good lungsdeef as i is i had myself a time trying to make out what he was yelling rannie began to cry moaning suddenly the breathing of snooks from the bed seemed to drown out the noise of the downpour outside rannie toomer could feel his pulse making the whole house shake here she cried snatching up the baby and handing him to the old woman make him well o my lawd make him well old sarah rose from her seat by the fire and took the tiny baby already turning a purplish blue around the eyes and mouth lets not upset this little fella unnecessarylike she said placing the baby back on the bed gently she began to examine him all the while moaning and humming some thin pagan tune that pushed against the sound of the wind and rain with its own melancholy power she stripped him of all his clothes poked at his fibreless baby ribs blew against his chest along his flat tiny back she ran her soft old fingers the child hung on in deep rasping sleep and his small glazed eyes neither opened fully nor fully closed rannie toomer swayed trancelike over the bed watching the old woman touching the baby she thought of the time she had wasted waidng for the real doctor her feeling of guilt was a stone ill do anything you say do aunt sarah she cried mopping at her nose with her dress anything you sayjust please god make him git better old sarah dressed the baby again and sat down in front of the fire she stayed deep in thought for several minutes rannie toomer gazed first into her silent face and then at the baby whose breathing seemed to have eased since sarah picked him up do something quick she urged sarah in her mind wanting to believe in her powers completely do something thatll make him rise up and call his mama the childs dying said the old woman bluntly staking out beforehand some limitation to her skill her powers were mostly those of a feeling heart availability and a desire to help that was the magic she had beyond the real doctor but she went on there might be something still we might do what aunt sarah what rannie toomer was on her knees before the old womans chair wringing her hands and crying she had never been more frightened in her life she fastened hungry eyes on sarahs lips how could she have thought the white doctor could help her snooks she had to believe totally in the powers of the old woman all she could see for saving her snooks was hidden in the deep brooding eyes of the withered old magician before her what can i do she urged fiercely hearing the faint labored breathing from the bed it going to take a strong stomach said old sarah slowly it going to take a mighty strong stomach and most you young peoples these days dont haveem snooks got a strong stomach rannie toomer cried looking anxiously into the serious old face it aint him thats got to have the strong stomach she said glancing down at the sobbing girl at her feet tom the one got to have the strong stomach he wont know what it is hes drinking she turned her hooded blue eyes towards the bed rannie toomer began to tremble way down deep in her stomach it sure was weak she thought trembling like that but what could she mean her snooks to drink not cats blood and not some of the messes with chicken droppings shed heard sarah mixed up for people sick with colic what did she mean what is it she whispered bringing her head close to the firm sure knee sarah leaned over and put her toothless mouth to her ear the only thing that can save this child now is some good strong horse tea she kept her eyes on the girls face the only thing her face was grim and if you wants him out of that bed you better make tracks to git some rannie toomer took up her wet outdoors coat and stepped across the porch to the pasture the rain was falling against her face with the force of small hailstones she started walking in the direction of the trees where she could see bulky lightish shapes that looked like cows her thin plastic shoes were nearly sucked off in the mud but she pushed herself forward searching with her eyes for the lone gray mare the gray mare was under the trees with the cows all the animals shifted ground and rolled big dark eyes at rannie toomer she made as little noise as she could and leaned herself against a tree to wait thunder rose from the side of the sky like tires of a big truck rumbling over rough dirt road then it stood a split second in the middle of the sky before it exploded like a giant fire cracker then rolled away again like an empty keg lightning streaked across the sky setting the air white and charged rannie toomer stood dripping under her tree hoping not to be struck she kept her eyes carefully on the behind of the gray mare and after nearly an hour had passed the old horse began nonchalantly to spread her muddy knees at that moment rannie toomer realized that in her grief and upset she had brought nothing to catch the precious tea in lightning struck something not far off and caused a cracking and groaning from the sky and woods that frightened the animals into running away from their shelter rannie toomer slipped down in the mud trying to take off one of her plastic shoes to catch the tea and the gray mare trickling some made a break for another spot of shelter along with the other animals rannie toomer was close enough to the gray mare to catch the tea if she could keep up with the mare while she ran so alternately holding her breath and gasping for air she started after her mud from her fall clung to her elbows and streaked her frizzy hair slipping and sliding in the mud she raced after the big mare holding out as if for alms her plastic shoe in the house the old woman sat with her shawls and sweaters tight around her rubbing her knees and muttering under her breath she heard the thunder felt the lightning that lit up the dingy room and turned her old wrinkled face to the bed hobbling over on stiff legs she could hear no sound the frail breathing had stopped with the thunder not to come again across the mudwashed pasture rannie toomer stumbled holding out her plastic shoe for the gray mare to fill in spurts and splashes mixed with rainwater she gathered her tea in parting the old mare snorted and threw up one big leg knocking rannie toomer back into the mud but she rose trembling and crying holding the shoe spilling none over the top but realizing a leak a tiny crack at her shoes front quickly she stuck her mouth there over the crack and ankle deep in the slippery mud of the pasture and freezing in her shabby wet coat she ran home to give the still warm strong horse tea to her baby snooks hold still judy mrs h simmons said around the spray of pins that protruded dangerously from her mouth she gave the thirtieth tug to the tight sash at the waist of the dress now walk over there and turn around slowly the dress judys first long one was white organdy over taffeta with spaghetti straps that bared her round brown shoulders and a floating skirt and a wide sash that cascaded in a butterfly effect behind it was a dream but judy was sick and tired of the endless fittings she had endured so that she might wear it at the debutantes ball her thoughts leaped ahead to the ball itself slowly i said mrs simmons dark angular face was always grim but now it was screwed into an expression resembling a prune judy starting nervously began to revolve by moving her feet an inch at a time her mother watched her critically no its still not right ill just have to rip out that waistline seam again oh mother judys impatience slipped out at last nobodys going to notice all those little details they will too theyll be watching you every minute hoping to see something wrong youve got to be the best cant you get that through your head mrs simmons gave a sigh of despair you better start noticin all those little details yourself i cant do it for you all your life now turn around and stand up straight oh mother judy said close to tears from being made to turn and pose while her feet itched to be dancing i cant stand it any more you cant stand it huh how do you think i feel mrs simmons said in her harshest tone judy was immediately ashamed remembering the weeks her mother had spent at the sewing machine picking her already tattered fingers with needles and pins and the great weight of sacrifice that had been borne on mrs simmons shoulders for the past two years so that judy might bare hers at the ball all right take it off her mother said im going to take it up the street to mrs luby and let her help me its got to be right or i wont let you leave the house cant we just leave it the way it is mother judy pleaded without hope of success i think its perfect you would mrs simmons said tartly as she folded the dress and prepared to bear it out of the room sometimes i think ill never get it through your head you got to look just right and act just right that rose griffin and those other girls can afford to be careless maybe but you cant youre gonna be the darkest poorest one there judy shivered in her new lace strapless bra and her old childish knit snuggies you make it sound like a battle im going to instead of just a dance it is a battle her mother said firmly it starts tonight and it goes on for the rest of your life the battle to hold your head up and get someplace and be somebody weve done all we can for you your father and i now youve got to start fighting some on your own she gave judy a slight smile her voice softened a little youll do all right dont worry try and get some rest this afternoon just dont mess up your hair all right mother judy said listlessly she did not really think her father had much to do with anything that happened to her it was her mother who had ingratiated her way into the gay charmers two years ago taking all sorts of humiliation from the betterdressed betteroff lighterskinned women humbly making and mending their dresses fixing food for their meetings addressing more mail and selling more tickets than anyone else the club had put it off as long as they could but finally they had to admit mrs simmons to membership because she worked so hard and that meant of course that judy would be on the list for this years ball her father a quiet carpenter who had given up any other ambitions years ago did not think much of negro society or his wifes fierce determination to launch judy into it just keep clean and be decent he would say thats all anybody has to do her mother always answered if thats all did wed still be on relief and he would shut up with shame over the years when he had been laid off repeatedly and her days work and sewing had kept them going now he had steady work but she refused to quit as if she expected it to end at any moment the intense energy that burned in mrs simmons large dark eyes had scorched her features into permanent irony she worked day and night and spent her spare time scheming and planning whatever her personal ambitions had been judy knew she blamed mr simmons for their failure now all her schemes revolved around their only child judy went to her mothers window and watched her stride down the street with the dress until she was hidden by the high brick wall that went around two sides of their house then she returned to her own room she did not get dressed because she was afraid of pulling a sweater over her hairher mother would notice the difference even if it looked all right to judy and because she was afraid that doing anything even getting dressed might precipitate her into the battle she drew a stool up to her window and looked out she had no real view but she liked her room the wall hid the crowded tenement houses beyond the alley and from its cracks and bumps and depressions she could construct any imaginary landscape she chose it was how she had spent most of the free hours of her dreamy adolescence hey can i go it was the voice of an invisible boy in the alley as another boy chuckled judy recognized the familiar ritual if you said yes they said can i go with you it had been tried on her dozens of times she always walked past head in the air as if she had not heard her mother said that was the only thing to do if they knew she was a lady they wouldnt dare bother her but this time a girls voice cool and assured answered if you think you big enough it said it was lucy mae watkins judy could picture her standing there in a tight dress with bright brazen eyes im big enough to give you a baby the boy answered judy would die if a boy ever spoke to her like that but she knew lucy mae could handle it lucy mae could handle all the boys even if they ganged up on her because she had been born knowing something other girls had to learn aw you aint big enough to give me a shoeshine she told him come here and ill show you how big i am the boy said yeah lucy mae whats happenin another younger boy said come here and tell us lucy mae laughed what im puttin down is too strong for little boys like you come here a minute baby the first boy said i got a cigarette for you aw i aint studyin your cigarettes lucy mae answered but her voice was closer directly below judy there were the sounds of a scuffle and lucy maes muffled laughter when she spoke her voice sounded raw and cross come on now boy cut it out and give me the damn cigarette there was more scuffling and the sharp crack of a slap and then lucy mae said cut it out i said just for that im gonna take em all the clack of high heels rang down the sidewalk with a boys clumsy shoes in pursuit judy realized that there were three of them down there let her go buster one said you cant catch her now aw hell man she took the whole damn pack the one called buster complained thatll learn you lucy maes voice mocked from down the street dont mess with nothin you cant handle hey lucy mae hey i heard rudy grant already gave you a baby a second boy called out yeah is that true lucy mae the youngest one yelled there was no answer she must be a block away by now for a moment the hidden boys were silent then one of them guffawed directly below judy and the other two joined in the secret male laughter that was oddly highpitched and feminine aw man i dont know what you all laughin about buster finally grumbled that girl took all my cigarettes you got some leroy naw the second boy said me neither the third one said what we gonna do i aint got but fifteen cent hell man i want more than a feel for a pack of cigarettes there was an unpleasant whine in busters voice hell for a pack of cigarettes i want a bitch to come across she will next time man the boy called leroy said she better buster said you know she better if she pass by here again we gonna jump her you hear sure man leroy said the three of us can grab her easy then we can all three of

out oh man dont do that we with you you know that sure buster we your aces man all right thats better there was a minute of silence then what we gonna do with the girl buster the youngest one wanted to know when she come back we gonna jump the bitch man we gonna jump her and grab her then we gonna turn her every way but loose he went on spinning a crude fantasy that got wilder each time he retold it until it became so secretive that their voices dropped to a low indistinct murmur punc tuated by guffaws now and then judy could distinguish the word girl or the other word they used for it these words always produced the loudest guffaws of all she shook off her fear with the thought that lucy mae was too smart to pass there again today she had heard them at their dirty talk in the alley before and had always been successful in ignoring it it had nothing to do with her the wall protected her from their kind all the ugliness was on their side of it and this side was hers to fill with beauty she turned on her radio to shut them out completely and began to weave her tapestry to its music more for practice than anything else she started by picturing the maps of the places to which she intended to travel then went on to the faces of her friends rose griffins sharp indian profile appeared on the wall her coloring was like an indians too and her hair was straight and black and glossy judys hair naturally none of these things had been done four days ago so that tonight it would be old enough to have a gloss as naturallooking as roses but rose despite her handsome looks was silly her voice broke constantly into highpitched giggles and she became even sillier and more nervous around boys judy was not sure that she knew how to act around boys either the sisters kept boys and girls apart at the catholic high school where her parents sent her to keep her away from lowclass kids but she felt that she knew a secret tonight in that dress with her hair in a sophisticated upsweep she would be transformed into a poised princess tonight all the college boys her mother described so eagerly would rush to dance with her and then from somewhere the boy would appear she did not know his name she neither knew nor cared whether he went to college but she imagined that he would be as dark as she was and that there would be awe and diffidence in his manner as he bent to kiss her hand a waltz swelled from the radio the wall turning blue in deepening twilight came alive with whirling figures judy rose and began to go through the steps she had rehearsed for so many weeks she swirled with a practiced smile on her face holding an imaginary skirt at her side turned dipped and flicked on her bedside lamp without missing a fraction of the beat faster and faster she danced with her imaginary partner to an inner music that was better than the sounds on the radio she was coming out and tonight the world would discover what it had been waiting for all these years aw git it baby she ignored it as she would ignore the crowds that lined the streets to watch her pass on her way to the ball aw do your number she waltzed on safe and secure on her side of the wallcan i come up there and do it with you at this she stopped paralyzed somehow they had come over the wall or around it and into her room man i sure like the view from here the youngest boy said how come we never tried this view before she came to life ran quickly to the lamp and turned it off but not before buster said yeah and the back view is fine too aw she turned off the light a voice complained put it on again baby we dont mean no harm let us see you dance some more i bet you can really do it yeah i bet she can shimmy on down you know it man come on down here baby busters voice urged softly dangerously i got a cigarette for you yeah and he got something else for you too judy flattened against her closet door gradually lost her urge to scream she realized that she was shivering in her underwear taking a deep breath she opened the closet door and found her robe she thought of going to the window and yelling down you dont have a thing i want do you understand but she had more important things to do wrapping her hair in protective plastic she ran a full steaming tub and dumped in half a bottle of her mothers favorite cologne at first she scrubbed herself furiously irritating her skin but finally she stopped knowing she would never be able to get cleaner than this again she could not wash away the thing they considered dirty the thing that made them pronounce girl in the same way as the other fourletter words they wrote on the wall in the alley it was part of her just as it was part of her mother and rose griffin and lucy mae she relaxed then because it was true that the boys in the alley did not have a thing she wanted she had what they wanted and the knowledge replaced her shame with a strange calm feeling of power after her bath she splashed on more cologne and spent minutes on her makeup erasing and retracing her eyebrows six times until she was satisfied she went to her mothers room then and found the dress finished and freshly pressed on its hanger when mrs simmons came upstairs to help her daughter she found her sitting on the bench before the vanity mirror as if it were a throne she looked young and arrogant and beautiful and perfect and cold why youre dressed already mrs simmons said in surprise while she stared judy rose with perfect icy grace and glided to the center of the room she stood there motionless as a mannequin i want you to fix the hem mother she directed its still uneven in back her mother went down obediently on her knees muttering it looks all right to me she put in a couple of pins that better yes judy said with a brief glance at the mirror youll have to sew it on me mother i cant take it off now id ruin my hair mrs simmons went to fetch her sewing things returned and surveyed her daughter you sure did a good job on yourself i must say she admitted grudgingly cant find a thing to complain about youll look as good as anybody there of course mother judy said as mrs simmons knelt and sewed i dont know what you were so worried about her secret feeling of confidence had returned stronger than ever but the evening ahead was no longer the vague girlish fantasy she had pictured on the wall it had hard clear outlines leading up to a definite goal she would be the belle of the ball because she knew more than rose griffin and her silly friends more than her mother more even than lucy mae because she knew better than to settle for a mere pack of cigarettes there her mother said breaking the thread she got up i never expected to get you ready this early ernest lee wont be here for another hour that silly ernest lee judy said with a new contempt in her young voice until tonight she had been pleased by the thought of going to the dance with ernest lee he was nice she felt comfortable with him and he might even be the awestruck boy of her dream he was a dark serious neighborhood boy who could not afford to go to college mrs simmons had reluctantly selected him to take judy to the dance because all the gay charmers sons were spoken for now with an undertone of excitement judy said im going to ditch him after the first dance mother youll see im going to come home with one of the college boys its very nice ernest lee she told him an hour later when he handed her the white orchid but its rather small im going to wear it on my wrist if you dont mind and then dazzling him with a smile of sweetest cruelty she stepped back and waited while he fumbled with the door you know edward im not worried about her any more mrs simmons said to her husband after the children were gone her voice became harsh and grating put down that paper and listen to me arent you interested in your child thats better she said as he complied meekly i was saying i do believe shes learned what ive been trying to teach her after all the whole damn t thing is berthas fault bertha is my roommate and a very black person to put it mildly shes a revolutionary i dont want to spend needless time discussing bertha but its sort of important before i met her i was ayn randbarry goldwater all the way bertha kept asking how could black people be conservative what have they got to conserve and after a while realizing that i had absolutely nothing period i came around but not as fast as she was moving it wasnt enough that i learned to like the regular mass of colored peopleas a whole as it werebut she wanted me to like the individual colored people that we knew i resisted that like hell but eventually came around bertha is the sort of person where eventually you come around now just be patient you want to know why im late dont you so i got an afro and began the conference beat and did all those black things that we were supposed to do i even gave up white men for the movement and that was no easy sacrifice not that they were that good nobody come down with a sister like a brotherbut they were a major source of support for me i agreed that they shouldnt be allowed to support the movement but i believe in income being passed around and if anyone has income to spare whiteys do so i cut myself off from a very important love of mine money and that presented a problem no im not going round robinhoods barn this is a part of it so when my income was terminated for ideological reasons youd think shed say something like ill take over the rent and your gas bill since youve sacrificed so much for the movement youd really think that wouldnt you but no she asked me about a job a job for christs sake i didnt even know anybody who worked but her and here she was talking bout a job i calmly suggested that i would apply for relief you see i believe society owes all of its members certain things like food clothing shelter and gas so i was going to apply to society since individual contributions were no longer acceptable she laughed that cynical laugh of hers and offered to go down with me no says i i can do it myself so i went down at the end of the week now im a firm believer in impressions i think the first impression people make is very important and since i would have to consider welfare my job from now on for berthas sake at least i got dressed up and went down im sure youve applied for relief at least once so you know the procedure i went to intake and met an old civil servant the kind whose been on the job since hayes set the system up she asked me so many questions about my personal life i thought she was interviewing me for a possible spot in heaven then we got to my family i told her mommy was a supervisor in the welfare department and that daddy was a social worker she shook her head and looked disgustedjust plain disgusted with mehuffed up her flat chest and said young lady you are not eligible for relief and stormed away i started after her what the hell do you mean eligible i asked ill take somebodys job who really needs it somebody with skills or the ability to be trained with a wife and kids or maybe just an unwed mother will be put out of work what kind of jive agency are you you sure dont give a damn about people as she turned the corner i had to run to keep up with her and who are you to decide what i need you nothing but a jive petty bourgeoisie bullcrap civil servant yes i did i told her exactly that i mean thats what she is going round deciding peoples needs you got needs yourself who decides how your needs gonna be filled you aint god or mary or even the holy ghost telling me what im eligible for and i was laying her out the nerve id come all the way down there and didnt have on levis or my miniskirt but looked nice i mean really clean and she says im not eligible really did piss me off at the end of the corridor where she was hurrying to i saw this figure it looked real small and pitiful like it was mommy i guess someone had recognized me and called her to come down i went over to put my arms around her dont cry mommy itll be all right but she just cried and cried and kept saying oh kim why cant you be like other daughters i got so involved with soothing her that the servant got away mom i said as i walked her to her office theres going to be a black revolution all over the world and we must prepare for it weve got to determine our own standards of eligibility thats all she quit crying a little and just looked at me pitifully then she put her arms around me and said oh kim i love you but why cant you just get married and divorced and have babies and things like other daughters why do you have to disgrace us like this i didnt mind when you got kicked out of school for drinking and i even got used to all those men i didnt like and remember the time you made the front page for doing that gogo dance at the democratic convention ive been a democrat all my life you know that but i was proud that in the middle of johnsons speech you jumped on the table shoes and all to dance your protest to the war in vietnam but this is my job your father and i have worked very hard to give you everything we could mom i cut her off im not against your job i tried to explain it wasnt personal even when i had to throw that rock through her office window that time we didnt fire bomb did we no i told the group dont fire bomb the welfare department and when we had to turn the directors car over you noticed that he didnt get hurt i told the group be sure not to hurt the director thats what i told them but mom im broke now all my savings are gone and if i dont get on relief ill have to take a job oh mommy what will i do if i take a job locked up in a building with all those strangers for eight hours every day and people saying good morning kim hows it going or hey kim what you doing after work i mean getting familiar with me and i dont even know them how could i stand that then for the first time in the years ive known her she looked me dead in the eyei mean exactly straightand said youll either have to work or go to grad school it floored me i mean shes never made a decision like that all the time ive known her mom i said you dont mean it youve been talking to bertha youre angry with me for what i told that civil servant ill apologize ill make it up somehow i swear ill get my hair done but she would not budge kim its school or a job mom member when i went back and graduated from college magna cum laude and all member how proud you and daddy were that i had the guts to go back after all they did to me in college member what you said member how you said i had done all you wanted me to do member how you kept saying you wouldnt ask me for nothing else member mom mom member but she wouldnt budge i tell you its something when your own mother turns against you she knew i was working for revolution what would happen to the revolution if i quit to take a job what would my people do i asked her and she looked at me and said rather coldly if i recall your people need you to lead the way not just toward irresponsible acts but toward a true revolution theres nothing irresponsible about chaos and anarchy we must brush our teeth before eating a meal kim ive read everything you have written ive heard on tape all your speeches and what are you talking about now program ive read frantz fanon and stokely carmichael i especially enjoyed burn the honky by h rap brown hes got an amazing sense of humor ive read killens and jones and neal and mckissick ive read most of the books on those lists you gave us havent i always tried to understand you and sympathize with you when i was going to get mother a cook book did i buy la gastronomiquel no i bought the ebony cook book even though mother has forgotten more than freda deknight could ever have known when your father and i went to the social work convention in detroit last year did we stay with the other delegates at the hilton no we stayed at the rio grande ive done all i could for the revolution and ill probably do more but im not going to allow you this behavior you will get a job or you will go to school aw mom i protested you just dont understand kim thats all there is to it ill give you a surprise when you tell me something definite i was crushed absolutely crushed my own mother turned against me i must have looked terribly hurt because she kissed me again and said oh kim its best really it is if i can read your people and try to understand your way you can try mine i called my father i asked him to take me to lunch i think he knew he didnt know when i called him but by the time we met for lunchhe knew course being a social worker and relating to people and all for a living he didnt just burst in and say i agree with your mother no he sat down and ordered me a drink he doesnt drink anymore since he and his liver made an intellectual decision that negroes shouldnt get high this is his sacrifice for the movement of course he quit five years ago when he was in the hospital he considered it a religious conversion thing his own special sacrifice to jesus we used to ask about it but he always just said jesus had spoken to him through his liver and nothing would shake him he quit church after a couple of months but he continued to tithe every month faithfully and never drank again his tennis game improved and he got to be a good swimmer again he took up golf and to tell the truth had gotten so damned cleancutamerican that mommy began sneaking gin into his eggs every morning just to keep him from becoming a real bastard he doesnt know that however so we sat down and i had a drink and we ordered lunch whats on your mind chicken he always calls me some sort of animal or inanimate object im not sure what his message is i didnt want to throw it on him right away daddymonmysaysivegottogotoschoolortakeajobandidontthinkthatsfair i said uhmm would you say that again in english i mean american mommy says i have to go to school or get a job good lambiepie which one is it daddy you dont understand i dont think its fair of course not sugar lump she shouldnt have said it like that you just get yourself a nice job you dont even have to consider school ill call up harry white and see what he can do for you course you can get one on your own you just let me know what you would like oh daddy i said youre on her side and shes been talking to bertha and nobody even understands me i try to understand you angel cake ive read almost all those books on your lists and everything youve written and ive heard all your speeches i think youre doing fine work but you must set an example too you just show your people that new systems can be created if you want to destroy something you must first learn how it works and what need its filling after thehow you say black flameencases the world youll want your people to work for the black nation how can you encourage that if you have no idea what youre asking of them thats one thing i noticed about everyone from nkrumah to ben bella to brown they dont really know what theyre asking everydaypeople to do not that they dont work and hardbut do they punch a time clock do they have a minute lunch break do they dig ditches work in a mine not that they have to do everyone of those but have they labored have they punched a time clock its important that they do and all the readand writing in the world doesnt give a true understanding of time clocks maybe theyll do away with time clocks but they must first understand what purpose they serve before they do oh daddy not that many black folks ever punch a clock im not talking just about a clock and you know it im talking about going to work on time eating lunch on time getting off on time going home on time all those meetings conferences and rallieseven if they are on time are scheduled to your and their conveniencenot the peoples get up at or go downtown eat lunch with a couple of thousand people relate to your supervisor relate to your clients relate to the people in your office or sewer get off at or rush home read your paper while your wife cooks dinner talk to your children listen to their troubles put them to bed talk to your wife listen to her troubles take her to bed and in your spare time watch tv say hello to your neighbor run to the store go to a rally try to read a book try that and you might understand why the revolution as you call it moves so slowly oh daddy i didnt want a lecture i just wanted you to be on my side is that my name now ohdaddy i am on your side brown sugar thats why im telling you this get yourself a job then do all the things youre doing you may readjust your methods i wont change i wont let the bourgeoisie system get me i didnt say your thinking kim i didnt say you would readjust your thinking i said you may change your methods lunch was ruined for me i went home to type a resume and that wasnt easy it had been that kind of a day i have this really neato pink ibmit was a gift though when i got it it was a downpayment its always worked right ive had it for twoandahalf years and never had a bit of trouble once a year i call the people and they clean and service itthats it its a dream but that day of all days it just wouldnt work right the s was skipping and the a was hitting twice plus the magic margin wouldnt click in and it was just a f y day i quit and stretched out on the floor i fell sort of half asleep i couldnt decide between school or an agency job and it must have been on my mind cause i had this really terrible dream there was this university chasing me down the streets i turned the corner to get away from it and ran right into the mouth of an agency it gobbled me up but it couldnt digest me when it tried to swallow me i put up such a fight that it belched me back into life as i hit the street there was this university again waiting for me like a big dyke that has run her prey into a corner with a greasy smile on her lips i woke up screaming both of them would destroy me and furthermore what did i need with a masters degree as i brooded on my future the image of educational institutions kept coming back going to school is like throwing the rabbit into a briar patch there would be scores of students that i could convert and because of academic freedom the school would have to accept and support me or at least leave me alone unless i flunked out drank a lot or smoked in public and if i applied in social work both mommy and daddy would be pleased cause id get a degree and agency training and an inadequate paycheck to boot so i sat down at my pink ibm to type a letter for an application blank surprisingly enough the typewriter was fixed i mailed it immediately and sat back while others stronger and wiser than i determined my fate geeze youve got a one track mind im trying to get around to explaining about the delay i was you know accepted in school i thought everyone would be happy and leave me alone that was february and i had nine months of freedom before enrollment day and i fully intended to use them i got my acceptance letter on a tuesday that was so upsetting that all i could do for a long time was just gnash and growl it didnt bother bertha a bit cause she just started running round the house singing kims going to school you know like she was happy my mood wasnt too positive so i told her dead calmly that if she didnt get the heck out of my half of the apartment id kill her she laughed one of those grand ha ha ha type things then spread her arms and pirouetted out the door it was hard to take after these years of free dom of choice and movement i was going back to school i just cried and cried then i thought what the hell hadnt i survived the time we were playing the prince of wales hadnt i survived the wisconsin sleeper hadnt i been to harlem hadnt i refused to lay a white boy when we were in mississippi on the big march why wouldnt i survive now i was really talking it up to myself much worse things had happened to me and here i was acting like a cry baby why wouldnt i survive i asked myself bravely boldly perhapsbrazenly why would i not survive because came the answer and i just cried and cried ive got to tell you this no dont be that waylisten if ever something happens to you that makes you real unhappy and youve just got to cry about it dont cry in the same spot move around thats what i learned after i cried and cried there was this shiny puddle around my feet and there were these bloodred eyes looking up at me i learned then never cry in one spot but i was cool with it i never really became emotionally involved in it i cleaned up the mess took a shower got dressed to a t then went out walking the streets i stopped by this bar i know and had a drink one of my brothers soul brothers bought me a drink and we started discussing what would have to come down he and i got into a real deep thing and we talked until the bar closed he kept wanting to kill toms and i still think thats not who we have to kill toms i told him only have power if we let them have power i mean if a tom says get off the streets and you get off the streets then thats your fault not his if on the other hand a tom tells you to get off the streets and you dont well then the power structure has no use for himplus if you can encourage him in a physical way to come on over to your side youve made a friend i mean you can beat anyone or boycott them or something besides killing a brother to get him to either help you or get out of the way there are too few brothers on this shore already to be killing each other off we need to get rid of whitey i mean if we cant kill a whitey how can we ever justify killing a brother thats a hell of a copout to me talking bout killing brothersand sisters tooand not being able to kill a whitey the only way we can ever justify offing a brother is if we have already offed whiteysthats the ratio i told him for offing a brother so we went to his place to talk farther the next morning all my problems were solved i thought i had figured it all out now this much i knew about social work school they will put up with anything at all except heterosexual relations i mean anything at all and the school where i was accepted was founded by two ladies who had adopted children i just knew if i wrote them and explained that i had not only been screwing but had enjoyed itwell i thought theyd write a nice letter explaining the mistake in accepting me and that would be the end of that so i jumped up and dashed home to compose a letter then i thought that wont get to them soon enough id better send a wire so i did to the school of social work directorof placement please be advised stop i have screwed stop it was good stop so there explanation point yours in freedom kim i thought that they would really be sick of me the minute they receive that i got a long involved letter explaining how proud they were that i was open to new things and that they were very pleased at my level of honesty i tell you i was peed thats the only way to describe it and what the heck did she mean new things id been screwing since i was ten if you want to count the times before it was serious and he wasnt new anyway i was truly indignant but bertha discouraged me from expressing my feelings to the school by just demoralizing my whole intellectual thing well yes it was a calculated intellectual involvement you see i never act on my unabridged emotions emotions are to be controlled by the intellect even when i act in what could be considered an emotional manner i have thought it out before and have decided this will be the way i act so to have my whole intellectual bag blown sky high right before my eyes well that was frightening i started to give bertha a quick punch in the gut but my whole actionreaction syndrome began to reek of emotion so i just cooled it a bit and dropped a half teaspoon of drano in her coffee later during the day strange about that i was only playing a little joke and there was plenty of milk on hand you see to help offset the effects so bertha drank her coffee and went to the john and never once indicated that anything was wrong later when i asked she did say it had been awfully runny but that was all im a failure i told myselfa failure oh goody im a failure i dont have to deal with it anymore i dashed a telegram off to the director of placement please be advised stop have put drano in roommates coffee stop she lives stop i am a failure you must reject me stop those ridiculous people up there just considered it a bid for attention i got a nice long letter explaining how they realized i hadnt received my placement yet and they were sorry but that they had a lot of work and sometimes even the best of us get tied down etc plus if you can dig it they think i have ingenious way of letting them know my needs i mean really ingenious goddamit i am a failure if i dont find a decent quick way out of this why ill end up in an institutiona part of an agencybeing decent responsibleall those ugly sick things that i hate id really have to think of a scheme it was way in the middle of april before it even dawned on me i mean it was so simple that i was overlooking the obvious what is the one thing we know for damned sure about white people i mean you know beside the fact that they hate negroes children and sex what is the one thing we know absolutely and positively about any honkie anywhere in the world that he worships money hes got such a case on money hes transferred it to anything green thats why you see those goddam keep off the grass signs not that he cares about grass but that its green whats the quickest way to turn a honkie off ask him for money hes as nice as he can be as long as he thinks hell get your moneybut the minute you ask him for some well thats like asking a hippie for his pot or a negro for his knife i mean they get hostile you dont believe it go into any bank and deposit five bucks then go back in a week and with draw it when you go to deposit it theyre all smiles the vp will come out and shake your hand the teller smiles and welcomes you to the family and thats only five bucks im talking about when you go to withdraw it the first thing the teller will say is you realize this will close your account just like you didnt know that if you deposit five bucks and you withdraw five bucks that you were closing your account and you just smile at him and say yeah groovy hell frown and say this will cost you one dollar and you say cool gimme my four bucks then he says this will take a minute thats when you look at him very menacingly and say i should surely hope the hell not then hell slam your money down and scream next or hell slap the next window please sign up and turn his back on you and this is a black teller im talking about so knowing this i wrote the director of placement and told her i had no money that i needed a stipend and a tuition grant i just knew for whatever my charm or whatnot that they werent going to pay me to go to their school i mean as tight as they are they are not about to give me any money i was as happy as a yearold turkey the day before thanksgivingi knew i now had them by the assi was just naturally too tough to handle i walked a little taller breathed a little deeper felt a little prouder i was so happy that i went back to my revolutionary work not that i hadnt been working for revolution all alongbut i had really been hung up on this thing about a job we set up a black arts festival and i was working my youknowwhatoff you may have heard about me being on the radio telling all the honkies not to come im sure you heard about lonnie going into the honkie neighborhood with his sign saying youre not ready it was great advertisement for us and we were all really sorry about that kid however though the papers played it down after the first day it is not true that lonnie tore his leg from the jointhe only fractured it and contrary to first reports the kid will walk again i personally tell all the brother black belts i know that they shouldnt provoke white kids then beat on them but well youre not always able to control folks even if they do take a lot of your advice but that was the only incident that could be in some quarters considered unfortunate it was a groovy set the blue beasts foamed at the mouth but it was our day i say again it was revolutionary slavetown usa was back in the movement cause the kim was back into her thing i really forgot all that crap about school and jobs and do i just put it out of my mind our underground press yes it does have something to do with why im late you see we were putting out a magazine called love black it was a group thing you know but it really belonged to all the people we had learned the secret of why the folks dont read cmon see do you know you jive they can too read but nobody ever writes for them or writes anything they can relate to so having figured that out through the very difficult process of stopping every brother we could on the corner one day and asking them what they would enjoy reading we went about getting love black out see most folks dont read honkies especially but people too you think they really read gh or time they look at the pictures and will scan any article they can see the end of most people like to read what they can see the end of so we started a black mag on vi x with articles that ran a page or less also it doesnt run over pages all toto therefore a brother can read the whole damned thing mag and really do two things learn something positive about himself and complete something he started now dont start breaking into my explanation it may well be propaganda but all pieces of paper with writing are propaganda and if i have to deal in mindcontrol its much better to be black washed i mean the honkie press and stuff just naturally screws with any black mans mind cause first it doesnt recognize that there is a black mind it does what it can to a black mindit whitewashes it it flushes it out of his head thats what it does but we were giving the people something and we were getting a lot one issue we were late and all kinds of soul stepped up and told me if i didnt get my thing together and get the mag out well they would look upon that with disfavor and they also sent articles in like wed get slightly used toilet tissue with an article on it or brown paper bags with short sayings or just a note to say they dig us some of it looked like our ancestral writing egyptian and we really had to work at deciphering it but when you saw how the man changed after he had published well it would really hit you you see the brother will read if hes writing it or if he knows people who are and love black was strictly ours it wasnt the prettiest thing in the world and sometimes it wasnt too clear ive always maintained that if we lose the revolution itll be because we know nothing about machinery but it was ours it talked about slavetown and what the brother thought and felt and the brother was digging it you got to understand the whole concept of writing like in the east everything is dishonest they do a lot of things but mostly its three thousand per cent b s the people are so used to talking black buying black and thinking black they dont get shook no more every hustler why is it a black capitalist is called a hustler and every panhandler is black so black dont mean nothing its taken for granted and one black thing is like another theyve been saturated with a program that has never come off between garvey and malcolm harlem should be owned lock stock and barrel by usbut we are still trying to get rat control and jobs and paying rent to circumcised honkies in the dupont plantation state they even passed a law that said if building codes arent lived up to you can deposit your money in one of the company banks and leave it then til the cat comes round aint that the jivest crap you ever heard of i mean paternalism with a capital white no wait a minute if you live in a house or apartment and something is wrong with it and you are living there everyday the good lord makes you black well you should fix that place up and whats left over from rent should go in your pocket so the old witch from the welfare department comes down and tries to explain that shell have to hold your check if you dont pay your rent to the rightful owner and thats when you come out of your thing so righteously and whip it on her so beautifully you just light up a joint and calmly explain that honkies have made women bombs and kellogs corn flakes but they have never made a piece of land the land is one bitch that is everybodys woman and i being man and all have got a right to a piece of her you see the honkies whole sex thing is tied up to land no lie land is their love all land except germany is female the motherland her sheall land is woman and they do anything to prove that they are worthy to be lands man only land dont give a crap about white people see land has this memory thing land remembers god stepped out on space and looked around and said ill make me a man god reached down into land a woman and formed this thingyou know a man now land has always been black and you know god well enough to know that he goes firstclass so god got the best land he could find which had to be the blackest land he could find you just dont know about no white land snow maybe some white sand maybe but you just dont know about no white land and land is hip to that land is very put out that we are making her prostitute herself for the beast you didnt hear about no land being raped until the beast came along we live in harmony with land because we are a part of land and we are out of land the honky came from sand and snow now what is that thats nothing it has a place on earth but its nothing snow freezes land and sand dries her up both destroy land and land wants to live and recreate you run it on down to where you are going to free land so that she can go about womans work of taking care of her childrenthe black people of the earth now shell send the law out but that dont mean nothing either the law only means something if you think it does so shell send out the law to make you pay and you smile sincerely and promise to get it in next week after youre alone with your piece of land you remove very carefully anything that cannot be replaced like pictures of your first lay your joints etc and you throw kerosene on everything else you see its yours and if you cant enjoy it in freedom and peace then land wants you to destroy it you cant destroy land because itll always be there but you can destroy the rapists claim stake the only thing about that land that makes the beast think he owns it is the claim hes stakeda house a building a fenceso you destroy that thats when you burn you dont bum to get the thief to fix it up you burn when youve staked your claim and they try to steal it from you and i really believe that after youve fixed it up and made it yours youll kill for it thats the one thing weve got to understand this revolution isnt to show what were willing to die for black people have been willing to die for damned near everything on earth its to show what were willing to kill for yes it is do we love life enough to deal righteously with key honkies we dont have to deal with king and young and those other three or four if we dont want to we have got to deal with the folks who send them up which means we have to control ourselves i have got to control me and you have got to control you like if i see something that needs to be done and you see something else we dont got to argue about what to do you do yours and ill do mine its like were on a road that forks off then comes back together we just had different priorities and that dont make one right or wrong just different but if i use the fact that you want to do something i dont want to do to keep from doing what i have to do then im not together im b sing and i know it see you and i are never in a conflict situation cause were after the same thingwere after the same honky and however we get him is our business all that jive about coordination and keeping people in line and elites and crap dont really mean nothing thats not revolutionthats not anarchy and anarchy is what we want this country doesnt have anything that we cant build again if we need it but to even try to think of taking over and preserving gm or something what for nobodys trying to make the system black were trying to make a system human so that black folks can live in it that means were trying to destroy the system its not even a question of whether black folks can run it better than white folks we dont have to prove to whities that we canand if we take over their system thatll be the reason we havent got to prove nothing to honkies cause they are nobodys authority on nothing but the whole damn thing i do blame on bertha cause i was just as happy sitting at home twittering my toes and masturbating every now and then i didnt even know that i was colored let alone anything about blackness but she kept bringing those beautiful black people home and they kept talking that talk to me and as i moved i moved toward black_power and i recognized the extent of white power which is so pervasive that the american solution cannot be black_power at all though as a world solution it is a possibility but must be revolutionanarchy total chaosand this should not be so hard for us since we have worked so diligently in every other cause we can now work for our own we have sacrificed our lives and interests for white power and now we can save ourselves through revolutionour baptism by fire but as i worked this out people kept calling me a hater and really im a lover no one knows how much i do love all that is lovable then bertha chimed in to ask do i love black folks enough to trust them to tcb and do i trust black people to do those things necessary by any means necessary recognizing that the means is in fact the ends she kept saying that if they and i are one then i should get out of the way and see where they would go without me and since revolution ages you so quickly and having watched the summer i had to admit that i was old and tired and recognized that already we were moving beyond my vision so maybe i should step aside and regroup so i packed and made arrangements to come to school and everybody cheered and was really pleased with my decision and i kept telling myself that it would be good and that i was dealing with the best the system had to offer and that if i couldnt relate meaningfully enough to them for me to accept them then i could easily go back to destroying it in a very real manner so having made my decision i decided to walk i mean it would have been much too tjh to hop a flight or thumb a ride ana though physical punishment of m self doesnt negate the total import of my act it did serve as a human extension of myself to help offset my total feeling of wasting my time and i had no idea you were so far away from uncle toms cabin in slavetown i had thought i could make it in a day or two but its taking much longer im really sorry about holding you up and all but its done now and here i am see can you handle it soon one morning the wheels of years of slavery ceased turn the i dont to know precise way in which it happened but i can sketch the events for you the sun had just started coming the semidarkness the at the gate of up and in men gathered white plantation the fence some elbows some support for their backs no one was nervous the they leaned on resting on their using the fence as a theyd all time a few much waiting though waiting a long make veyed the leaving the and nurtured they had been more minutes couldnt difference they surland which they were land they had coaxed from which each which brought forth seas of cotton none of them supposed that he would miss this place each had been moving all his life trying to find someplace where his work would do him some good where after five or six years of labor he could have enough set aside so that his wife and children could rest from the crippling work in the fields ironically most of them had come over to this place in the miss ssippi delta from the hills expecting to find a land of opportunity they had been told that they could make a lot of money over in the deltas cottonfields so they had left sharecropping in the hills slipping off in the night so that the bossman wouldnt know they were going they owed him money he had furnished them so that they could livethat is subsisteach year to produce another crop for him old man brown twisted around so that he leaned sideways on the gate even though he was in his fifties he was still a handsome man his skin a reddish brown his black hair richly mixed with grey closing his eyes to the growing brilliance of the sun he chewed on a long blade of grass and thought back over the years he had invested in this land it had been a long time since hed done thisthink back mostly he had applied his energies to coping with the present to making it through a day in the field to stretching a dollar to feed people the past for the old man was his big girl frankie mae she was his first child bom years ago shed lain in the fields while he and his wife mattie made their first crop and when they lived in the hills she had gone everywhere with him he had a blue bicycle with a rusty wire basket in the front he used to put frankie mae in the basket and ride her to town with him and to church and sometimes they would go nowhere special just riding she fitted so well into the basket that for a few years the old man thought that the basket was growing with the child but when frankie reached six she became too large to ride with him also he had four more children by then so he bought a car for not long after frankie mae stopped riding in the basket he became restless he had heard about how you could make a lot of money over in the delta so he decided to go over there he packed what he could carry in one loadthe children a few chickens and a mattressand slipped off one night frankie mae sat next to him on the drive chattering while he drove excited about the promising new place where they would live when a tire blew out she would climb out to help him while the others slept she knew the tools to be used and would bring them to him just the minute before he turned to ask for them at six she was a beautiful black child with delicate limbs and huge green eyes that seemed to glow in the dark she was always alive and happy the only thing wrong was that she got hurt so easily the slightest rebuke sent her crying the least hint of disapproval left her moody and depressed for hours on the other hand she had a way of springing back from pain no matter how hurt she was she would be her old self by the next day the old man worried over her he wanted most to cushion her life to protect her from the sharp points on which he had been cut he understood later that that was why he had moved to the delta maybe he would be able to make enough to get her out of the south get her some clothes and put her into a nice school somewhere two days after they left the hills they drove up to the white plantation in leflore county mississippi they were given a creaky tworoom house and told the conditions of their stay they would work acres on shares percent to them and to the bossman the fertilizer the packaging and any other such expenses would be deducted from their percent they would be furnished a month for living expenses while they were making the crop the old man and mattie worked hard that year up at breakfast of grits and syrup then out to the field frankie mae stayed behind to nurse the other children and to watch the pot of beans which was cooking for dinner at noon they would come in and eat with the children and then be gone again until dark they would drag themselves home eat some bread and syrup and get ready for the next daydo a little sweeping snap some beans wash for the baby then they would sit on the porch together for maybe a half hour that was the time the old man liked best the half hour before bed frankie mae would tell him the events of the daya man from town had come by and tried to take their stove because they were three months behind in their payments frankie had told him she had just that morning seen a money order come in the mail from uncle ed and she had heard her daddy say he was going to use it to pay off the stove man the man believed the story and left the stoveor she would tell how willie b the three year old had wandered off the porch and hit his head on a rock she had carried him down the road to the woman they called granny who was too old to work in the fields but who stayed resolutely on in her little shack she said i know mr white junior aint gonna put me out it dont look right i work for him all my life and make him rich and then he try to put me out even white folks dont get that low honey no i aint moving granny had wrapped up the childs head and given him some aspirin along with the admonition to be careful and stop causing grown folks trouble during their half hour the old man would tell frankie what a good job she had done that day he would go on about how smart she was going to be when she started schoolwhich would be in two years when the oldest boy was big enough to take care of the others she would sit straight up and her green eyes would glow at his praise and then she would join him in a well rehearsed exchange they were going to make a lot of moneyyes five hundred dollars and go far awayyes and buy a washing machine for mama and a big rocking chair for the old man yes yes after a while mattie would pick up the baby and go inside the others would follow and they would fall into the two beds which were stacked high with worn out mattresses and newspapers and blankets the next morning they would be up again at the end of the year just before christmas they went to settle up they learned that they were in the hole they owed mr white junior on next years crop the old man didnt see how this could have happened yes he had borrowed money to eat and to pay three doctor bills but how could the figures have come out so badly against him yet there it was on paper what he owed and why the bossman offered to let him have some money for christmas but he refused he hated to get still deeper in debt he and mattie went home and told the children no christmas this year they would try to do better next year he was sad he had wanted terribly to buy a doll for frankie mae to give her something to play with during the snatches of time when she wasnt tending the children or doing chores he knew just the doll too a huge doll blond with smooth white skin it wore a blue satin dress and stood in front of the long white columns of a cardboard plantation big house he knew that frankie stood in front of this scene in the store window for hours whenever they went to town he would get it for her the next year next year turned out to be the same only a few things were changed the debt was higher because the earlier had to be added on to it now they owed and mr white junior decided to take them off shares all the hands would work together in whatever field he chose he would pay a day for chopping cotton and by the hundred pounds for picking the hands had no choice they could work by the day or leave actually it didnt make much difference they werent making any money on shares anyhow also the old man was made the timekeeper over the other workers that year as timekeeper the old man was given a large battered watch and told to see that the workers in the field made a full day if someone got sick and had to leave brown had to know because no one was paid for less than a day it was also his job to see that no one rested too long in the field they had to keep moving or go home and he had to see to it that all the weeds were kept out of the cotton the job was hard for him but he figured he treated the hands as well as anybody in his position could he had to see that the work was done and at the same time give the workers as much slack as he possibly could the worst part was in keeping after the women whose time was about to come he hated to see them drag themselves to the field their bellies almost bursting they were supposed to keep pace with the others which was impossible yet they had to work at it the best way they could and try to make it through the day because they had to make the to pay esther the midwife the old man would feel a pain in his chest when mr white junior would slip up on them and find one of the big bellied women lagging behind the others the woman would be sent home walkingsometimes three or four miles depending on the field they were working mr white junior didnt carry hands home except to eat dinner and after the day had been made even if the woman had made six or seven hours she still had to go home without the and brown would be cursed for not watching the hands more closely one day when he had carried the hands in from the field mr white junior stopped the old man as he was climbing down from the back of the pickup truck johnnie he said it dont look right to me for you to leave a girl at home that could be working when i need all the hands i can get this cotton cant wait on you all to get ready to chop it i want frankie mae out there tomorrow he had tried to resist but we getting along with what me and mattie makes aint got nothing but we eating i wants frankie mae to go to school we can do without the few dollars she would make mr white junior didnt bother to answer this he swung into his truck and started the motor framed by his shotgun which hung from a rack in the rear window he said get that girl down here tomorrow dont nobody stay in my house and dont work and he skidded off that night the old man dreaded the half hour on the porch when frankie had started school that year she had already been two years late and she had been so excited about going every night for months they talked about how much she was learning and all the nice people she metshe would probably make up those two years in no time they could double promote smart childrenprobably she would get a job as a schoolteacher when she finished and wear a white blouse every day when the wood had been gathered and the children cleaned up he followed frankie onto the sloping porch she started telling him about the magnificent yellow bus in which she rode to school he sat down next to her on the step frankie mae im got to tell you something whats that daddy mama say i been slow bout helping round the house since i been going to school i do better guess lost my head over the schoolhouse no baby that aint it at all you been helping your mama fine he stood up to face her but could not bring his eyes to the level of her bright face mr white junior stopped me today when i was getting off the truck say he want you to come to field til the chopping get done she found his eyes oh and what did you say daddy well i told him how you wanted to go to school and we could do without your little money but he say you got to go the childs eyes lost their brilliance her shoulders slumped and she began to cry softly tired the old man sat back down on the step he took her hand and sat with her on the porch long after mattie and the children had gone to bed as he sat in the darkness he held tightly to the smooth little hand soon it would be hard and calloused the next morning frankie was up first she woke up her daddy and the others scolding them for being so slowthey had to go get all that cotton chopped no sense in wasting good daylight time in sleeping brown sat up in the bed he was already dressed since he had felt too tired to take off his clothes the night before he got up and threw some water on his face then he smiledthats how frankie mae was she would feel real bad terrible for a few hours but she always snapped back she would be all right now on the way to the field he said baby im gonna make you the watergirl all you got to do is carry water over to them that hollers for it and keep your bucket full you dont have to chop none lest you see mr white junior coming no daddy thats all right the other hands will say you was letting me off easy cause im yours say you taking advantage of being timekeeper ill go on and pick with the rest he tried to argue with her but she wouldnt let him give her the water bucket finally he put her next to mattie so she could learn from her as he watched over the field he forced himself not to think about his child inhaling the cotton dust and insecticide when his eyes happened on frankie mae and mattie their backs bent over he quickly averted them once when he jerked his eyes away he found instead the bright yellow school bus bouncing along the road frankie learned quickly how to chop the cotton and even seemed to find something about it to enjoy sometimes when they were working in a remote field the choppers would go at noon to the store for their dinner instead of going home they would buy sardines or canned sausages and crackers these they would have with pork and beans which they ate from jaggededged cans at the store the old man would watch with pride as frankie laughed and talked with everyone if there were hands from town she would make a point of going over and being friendly with them and she would make dates to attend church with the ladies at the different churches in town and on the other plantations every sunday frankie had a service to go to their own church met for service only once a month on the third sunday so on the other sundays she went visiting the old man went with her sometimes because he liked so much to see her enjoy herself that year they finished the chopping in june it was too late to send frankie back to school and she couldnt go again until after the cotton had been picked when she went back to school in november she had missed four months and found it hard to keep up with the children who had been going all the time still she went every day that she could she stayed home only when she had to when her mother was sick or when in the cold weather she didnt have shoes to wear whenever she learned that she couldnt go to school on a particular day she would withdraw into herself for an hour or so and then she would smile and make the best of it by easter time she could write her name and read a little and add simple figures when company came the old man would call her to read them some passages from the family bible when it came time to chop the cotton again she had to stop school once more that was how the years went in the fall and spring brown carried her and the other children who were over eight years old to the field with him and in the winters he sent them to school as many days as he could some years frankie was promoted to the next grade and some years when she had missed five or six out of the nine school months she wasnt if it was possible the old man loved her still more now he saw the children of the other workers and his own children too get discouraged and stop going to school they said it was too confusing they never knew what the teacher was talking about because they had not been there the day before or the month before and they resented being left behind in classes with children half their size he saw the other children reach the point where they wouldnt hold themselves up wouldnt try to be clean and make folks respect them yet every other day his frankie mae managed to put on a clean starched dress and if she couldnt go to school that day she wore the dress for their half hour on the porch by the time frankie was she could figure as well as the preacher and she was made secretary of the church that same year she asked her daddy if she could keep a record of what they spent during the year the old man was proud for her to do this he felt like something was wrong when each year he came out owing money but he didnt know how to do anything about it maybe this year with frankie to help him he could come out ahead he promised her that if it was possible any way this year he would buy her a sunday dress from the store in town it would be her first storebought dress he gave her all his receipts from the last seven years frankie bought a black and white speckled notebook she put in it what they made and what they paid on their bill after chopping time she became excited they had just about paid the bill out she and the old man would sit on the porch and go over the figures and plan what they would buy for christmas sometimes they even imagined that they would take a drive up to chicago to see uncle ed frankie told him that this year she would go to her first christmas dance at the schoolhouse in her new dress every so often he would try to hold down her excitement by reminding her that the figures would have to be checked against the bossmans figures but sne was so proud to be using what she had learned to help the family that he felt bad about saying things to discourage her just before christmas tne families on the place went to settle up for the year settling up meant finding out what they owed for the year before and borrowing as much as the man would let them have so that they could buy themselves some christmas when it came to the old mans turn he trembled a little it was almost too much to hope for that they would have money coming to them instead of owing it all the year he had kept from thinking about it too seriously except for m the times when frankie pulled him into her planning he motioned to frankie mae and went with her to the table where there were several stacks of five and ten dollar bills a big ledger and a pistol he took heart from the absolute confidence with which frankie mae walked next to him and controlled his tremblingmaybe the child was right and they had something coming to them hey there johnnie mr white junior said see you brought frankie mae along fine fine good to start them early here have a seat the old man gave frankie the one chair and stood besde her the bossman riffled his papers and came out with a long narrow sheet brown recognized his name at the top here you are johnnie yall come out pretty good this year proud of you dont owe but since you done so good gonna let you have for christmas frankie mae spoke up i been keeping a book for my daddy and i got some different figures let me show you there was a stillness in the room everyone while pretending not to notice the girl was listening intently to what she said mr white junior looked surprised but he recovered quickly why sure be glad to look at your figures you know its easy to make a mistake ill show you what you done wrong brown clutched her shoulder to stop her from handing over the book but it was too late already she was leaning over the table comparing her figures with those in mr white juniors ledger see mr white junior when we was chopping last year we made and you took of that to put on our bill there there it is in your book and we borrowed in july there it is as she talked the other workers lifted and turned their heads until they were all looking straight at the black girl who was leaning over the table explaining to mr white junior that they had the same figures the man behind the table grew red one of his hands gripped the table while the other moved toward the pistol frankie mae finished so you see you owe us for the year the bossman stood to gain the advantage of his height he seemed about to burst his eyes flashed wildly around the room and his hand clutched the pistol he was just raising it from the table when suddenly he caught hold of himself he took a deep breath and let go of the gun oh yeah i remember what happened now johnnie it was that slip i gave you to the doctor for willie b you remember last year before chopping time i got the bill last week it came to let me think yeah that was the old mans tension fell away from him and he resumed his normal manner he knew exactly what the bossman was saying it was as he had expected as it had always been lets go baby he said but frankie didnt get up from the chair for a moment she looked puzzled then her face cleared she said but willie b didnt have anything wrong with him but a broken arm the doctor spent minutes with him one time and minutes the other that couldnt cost no whites hand found the pistol again and gripped it until the knuckles were white the old man pulled frankie to him and put his arm around her with his free hand he fingered his own pistol which he always carried in his pocket he was not afraid but he hated the thought of shooting the man even if he just knicked him it would be the end for himself and who would take care of mattie and the children already he had done three years on the state farm he knew what it was like and he never wanted to go back there he drew a line for himself if mr white junior touched him or frankie he would shoot him short of that he would leave without a fight the bossman spat thick brown tobacco juice onto the floor spattering it on the old man and the girl nigger he said i know you aint disputing my word dont nobody live on my place and call me no liar that bill was you understand me he stood tense staring with hatred at the man and the girl everyone waited for browns answer the old man felt frankies arms go round his waist tell him no daddy we right not him i kept them figures all year they got to be right the gates of the state farm flashed through the old mans mind he thought of mattie already sick from high blood trying to make a living for people frankies arms tightened yessir he said i understand the girls arms dropped from him and she started to the door the other workers turned away to fiddle with a piece of rope or to scold a child brown accepted the which was thrown across the table to him as he turned to follow frankie he heard mr white juniors voice low now and with a controlled violence hey you girl frankie mae she stopped at the door know this white continued long as you live im gonna be right and you gonna be wrong now get your black ass outta here the child stumbled out to the car and crawled onto the back seat she cried all the way home brown tried to quiet herthey had done the best they could next year would be better she still could have the sunday dress the next morning he laid in bed waiting to hear frankie mae moving around and fussing that was how he knew each time that she had snapped back to her old self he laid there until everyone in the house had gotten up still he did not hear her finally he got up and went over to where she was balled up in the blankets he woke her she raised herself listlessly and went to throw some water on her face she didnt even bother to change the dress in which she had slept when the schoolbus came she said she had a stomach ache and wouldnt be going brown sat out on the porch all day long wishing that she would join him and struggling to understand what had happened this time frankie had not bounced back to her old brighteyed self the line which held her to this self had been stretched too taut it had lost its tension and had fallen slack at her side frankie never again kept a book for her daddy she lost interest in things such as numbers and reading she went to school as an escape from chores but got so little of her lessons done that she was never promoted from the fourth grade to the fifth when she was and in the fourth grade she had her first child after that there was no more thought of school in the following four years she had three more children she sat around the house eating and growing fat when well enough she went to the field with her daddy it wasnt that she was sullen or evil just disinterested in anything outside the tworoom shack her dresses were seldom ironed now whatever she could find to wear would do still there were a few times maybe once every two or three months when she was lively and fresh she would get dressed and clean the children up and have her daddy drive them to church on such days she would be the first one up she would have food on the stove before anybody else had a chance to dress it was for these isolated times that the old man waited they kept him believing that she would get to be all right until the day she died he woke up every morning listening for her laughter waiting for her to pull the covers from his feet and scold him for being lazy she died giving birth to her fifth child the midwife esther was good enough but she didnt know what to do when there were complications frankie mae bled to death on the hundred mile drive to the charity hospital in vicksburg the old man squinted up at the fully risen sun the bossman was late he should have been at the gate by this time well it didnt matter just a few more minutes and they would be through with this place forever his thoughts went back again to the time when the civil_rights workers had first come around and they had started their meetings up at the store they had talked about voting and about how black people should have the same rights as whites and they had talked about how plantation workers should be making enough to live on brown and the other men had listened and talked and agreed so they decided to ask mr white junior for a raise thev would ask for the men to be paid for their hour work day well they had asked and he had said hell no before he would raise them he would lower them so they agreed to ask him again and if he still said no they would go on strike at first brown hadnt understood himself why he agreed to the strike it was only this morning that he realized why it was frankies wideeyed children there were two the two dark ones who moved around him with a terrible solemnity which seemed to continually rebuke him for the absence of their mother even during his scattered moments of gayety their green eyes followed him he couldnt send them the way frankie had gone not if he had a chance to do better and this strike was the chance he needed a cloud of dust rose up in front of brown the bossman was barrelling down the road in his pickup truck he was mad that was what he did when he got mad got in his truck and drove wildly up and down the road brown chuckled when they got through with him this morning he probably would run that truck into the river you see mr white junior didnt believe that they would quit him they had all left him at one time or another to try out some other plantation and all had come back some had gone and come back two or three times so he thought they were bluffing when they demanded the raise now he would find out differently he climbed down from the truck and mrde h s way over to the gate he began to give the orders for the day who would work in the shop what fields would be chopped what tractors would be used the men moved away from the fence disdaining any support for what they were about to do one of the younger men james lee spoke mr white junior we wants to know is you gonna raise us like we asked no goddammit now go on do what i told you then james lee continued we got to go on strike from this place james lee and the others began to leave the gate which had bound up the years of their lives ben handed mr white junior the keys to the shop and the old man handed him the scarred watch that had kept track of his peoples wastage of life and energy in the hot endless rows of cotton the watch that had ticked away frankie maes youth leaving her broken and dreamless at i think it was the moment when the old man handed over the watch that for these men and their families the wheels of slavery ground to a halt the south that shug remembers is one of morning dew covered greenfields hookyday fishing on the tombigbee river and dollar cricket catchbut that is the south of a seven year old wagonbox happy rider it was a long time ago when shug was seven riding wagons catching crickets shug is riding south now passing dewcovered greenfields fhe is approaching the death of a father he has left something almost the same as a slow dying a daily struggle for survival and shug the rider knows that the father that he must see dying has been dead for a lifetime he died when he sent shug north to ghettoland at seven to become polluted and to fight a losing battle for survival now to fight forever the rider passes through green tree hamlets filled with greenfields and mossfilled shady lanes departing and approaching slow death far away he sees tree top landscaping and all the mossfilled trees on shady river banks look exactly as he remembers mossfilled trees twentyone years ago along the tombigbee river looking out the dark glass at the lonely telephone poles shug thinks of north the winters the winds basement a mother dying leaving him all alone alone it was lonely in ghettoland then december bleak but no dying embers warmed shugs year old body each gust of cold wind found its way into the dark hallway where he tried to sleep and with each gust of wind shug mumbled curses back at the dawn cursing did not stop the wind it had so many entrances it had a young boy homeless ragged that wind had shug captured jailed he could not blow his nose as he wanted because he was afraid he might wake the daynight sleepers within the house had him so that he could sleep only until he heard movements from the sleepers in the house or until the december dawn entered into daybreak the december wind bit and pricked shugs black body taking advantage of its opportunities cold frightened ragged praying for a father a remembered south without that which ones values depend not able to find it work for it shug was lost in north ghettoland could there be any warm and pretty places for him to sleep tomorrows or would he forever dream of other hallways in other tomorrows shug sat up rubbed his body and gymshoe covered feet trying to get circulation in frozen blackness listened to the wind blow wanted to blow his nose could not felt the cold mucous running down and over his mouth wanted to sneeze wanted wanted to remember what it was like to eat a warm breakfast wanted to remember the taste of grits and eggs cooked food could not shug was in ghettoland and not a remembered dewcovered southland ma cold help me his mother could not hear him her struggle was over ma he said take my cricket money he wiped his nose the tears from his eyes man what you talking about crickets for a rat greygreen wet and cold too entered with the next gust of wind looked at shug shaking went up the stairs scratched at the door silence who entering from that outside world of white and light could help shug he rested his head against the wall of the hall teeth chattered rattled it was so cold so dark in that hallway its always so cold and dark shug was thinking it was cold and dark that morning when the city ambulance took his mother away that morning the wind and the ice became one and ghettoland rested cold silent as if deciding whether to eat its people for warmth and shug one of the people must be eaten by it or he must destroy it knowing this watching them take her away shug hoped that outside world would come although violence was around him he had never destroyed nature beyond the cricket not able to scream in rage shug could only pray frozen prayers to nature or destroy it that morning the wind and the snow as one whirled and twisted lodging itself here and there in the transparent dwellings through that land before entering shug and his mothers basement bottom dark it was away down there he moved around fumbling in darkness giving his mother the drugstore medicine the broth he vaguely re membered her making when he was sick with cold hearing her cough that faint cough she had suffered with for so long shug wondered when the other world of white and light omnipotence would come dark it was down there in that basement when his mother stopped coughing and so very dark it was when he watched them take her away from his young life that outside world of white and light did not come looking out of the glass door into dawn he saw the snow falling so white and beautiful that he wanted to enter it looked again at his gym shoes again out the glass door heard his empty stomach growl listened to the wind blow damn man you need something to eat picked up his cardboard box with the odds planned to take them to the junkyard could use the box later after he sold the two pieces of iron to make a fire could warm his hands and feet shug cautiously went out into the pretty white snow where you go man where you get something to eat shug moved a little faster had read in a comic book how this guy lost in the cold forest kept warm by running through the alleys of that land searching through garbage cans for a morning breakfast somewhere shug found a biscuit somewhere he found an end piece of wonder bread sat in the snow eating the frozen food why you here man had been to the welfarehave your mother come in adc fathers name the people mister loan me fifty cent had been what bright places could shug go tomorrow that were dark yesterdays school look at shugs old clothes look at his shoes he ate the piece of hard wonder bread saved the biscuit started running again to the junkyard running running to sell his iron running home from school in alabama at the age of seven passing dewcovered

be seeing you son uh huh im sorry for everthang me me too man nature nd needs of the ck ersity by gerald mcworter evolutionary change for the liberation of a people from oppressive social structures is not the special function of one course of action but more likely the result of several and while education is generally hoped to be a liberating force on mens minds and bodies ofttimes it has been used as a debilitating tool in the interests of an oppressive society accordingly kwame nkrumah compares the colonial student educated for the art of forming not a concrete environmental view of social political problems but an abstract liberal outlook with the revolutionary student animated by a lively national consciousness who sought knowledge as an instrument of national emancipation and integrity so it is becoming rather clear that educational institutions are vital to a liberation movement a fact of negro digest march modern times in anticolonial movements in the third world in the united states there is no question about the persistence of segregation racism and more subtle forms of neoracism as the pernicious oppression of racism is an organic part of the institutions symbols and values of western industrial society so it is firmly entrenched in the usa as american as apple pie an afro american liberation movement must subvert andor supplant such a wellentrenched social system if it is to be a real source of radical change and not a false one my primary task in this discussion is an ideological consideration of the role of a university in the liberation of the afroamerican community it must be clear that this role has to deal with todays world as well as with what ought to be and certainly it must include the management of whatever social change is required to move effectively from the is to the ought the university is alive for people in the world including all of the socioeconomic and political hangsup involved and so must meet the challenge of responding creatively to whatever needs exist now for those people but at the same time it must project itself as a prophetic institution calling into question all that which is inconsistent with its highest ideals and organizing its activities to bring about the realization of its ideals the focus of this discussion is on what ought to be the prophetic social role of the black university for therein lies the fountainhead of revolutionary liberation we must be reminded of this same theme as stated by dr w e b du bois over years ago in the niagro movement resolutions and when we call for education we mean real education education is the development of power and ideal we want our children trained as intelligent human beings should be and we will fight for all time against any proposal to educate black boys and girls simply as servants and underlings or simply for the use of other people they have a right to know to think to aspire we do not believe in violence but we do believe in that willingness to sacrifice money reputation and life itself on the altar of right the booker t washingtondu bois dialectical opposition is relevant here as it is the important example of the is versus the ought concerning educational ideology for afroamericans training people to fit in where they can think of mdta job corps etc might be acceptable for short term solutions though not as washington thought it to be but the educational ideology of du bois is our prophecy a rationale to built a black universitythe crucible of definitive social change in order that the idea of the new university and the notions of how we are to achieve it as a goal will be more clearly understood it is important to discuss briefly the current social situation the current situation is one charged with a great deal of expectancy on the part of many afroamericans an expectancy frequently expressed by the emotional connotations of a term or phrase but usually not delineated in structural or programmatic terms but this programmatic deficiency is not so much a shortcoming for the exciting search for innovation and relevance is the first sign of progress a major question then is what conditions give rise to this expectancy this charged atmosphere crystallized around the term black university a major trend in todays world is that as oppressed people know that the world offers more than they have and as they are able to get a little more of it they also expect to get very much more this has been called the revolution of rising expectations a figurative example an afroamerican family gets a television set and enters as a spectator the world of affluent euroamerican society it is not complicated to see that this would lead to the family wanting more than it has much more just imasine how cruel it must be for poor oppressed black people to watch the giveaway quiz programs on which white people win appliances furniture and cars in minutes or so then think of a scene of ghetto destruction during which people brave armed police to steal appliances furniture and cars in minutes or so oppressed people see what is going on and want in in the best way they can get in yes by any means necessary to do it right now along with this developing desire to get more out of society there also is the increasing saliency of a nationalistic alternative to the system the general components are militancy selfdetermination and a desire to identify with similar oppressed people throughout the world who are not by accident mostly colored people this alternative is grounded in communalism and finds its legitimacy from within afroamerica and not outside of it nationalism in this context means total concern for the community of common experience so afroamerican nationalism is grounded in the black experience communalism meaning selfhelp cooperative efforts is the ethic supporting the new alternative these two major trends cannot be viewed outside of the total context of world events especially those events of particular relevance to the afroamerican community the militaryindustrial machine of the western powers is equally offensive and outraging in vietnam and south africa in santo domingo and ghana but it seems apparent that peoples can only unite across the world in aspiring for the same universalspeace freedom and justicewhile focusing their working activities on the social ills as manifested at home if we are to reap a harvest of world brotherhood then each man must first tend to his own garden but for each garden to have its true meaning the gardener must know his historical role and his relationship with all others working for the same harvest the two trends are general social sources of the cry for a black university while everyone is more or less for such a thing as a university for some the quality of blackness imbues the concept with polemical emotional intensity and conceptual ambiguity or in extreme cases of racism this must be cleared up if the dialogue is to continue in reference to a university blackness must mean at least three things first blackness refers to the afroamerican community as the basic focus for the university this in no way compromises or limits its universalistic orientation or its attempts to contribute to human progress rather it frees it to be relevant in the face of an unmet need reflecting the woeful limit of human progress a second and more controversial point considers the limits placed on participation in the university blackness does not categorically exclude all white people from the university it redefines the standards for their participation and the possibility for their involvement in much the same way that independent african countries have attempted to redefine the possible role of the european so in the black university the role of the white man must be redefined and carefully placed for the maximum good of all some white people will be necessary for the immediate future if for no other reason than the black communitys own shortage of resources but unconditional participation will have to be ended the participation must be based on a commitment to the goals and aspirations of the afroamerican community and the white participant must possess the sacrificial humility necessary for one historically and socially identified with the beast of afroamerican history and the system of oppression last blackness is an affirmation of an identity independent of the historical human evils of modern nation states and is closely tied to the emerging international identity of man in his struggle for a better life consider this revelation by brother malcolm_x when on his pilgrimage to mecca that morning was when i first began to reappraise the white man it was when i first began to perceive that white man as commonly used means complexion only secondarily primarily it described attitudes and actions in america white man meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man and toward all other nonwhite men but in the muslim world i had seen men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been the relations between people must be allowed to grow and progress without the limiting problem of the national state who are we afroamericans men of the world why are we here we were sent here to love where are we going toward the community of love and if stopped we will continue by any means necessary because we must continue so much for prologue what is the black university idea all about what are its goals and what might it look like the university focusing on the particular needs of the afroamerican community will be a center of learning but recognizing the alternatives noted above by nkrumah it must be based on an educational ideology grounded in an uncompromising goal of psychological independence from the oppressor and his oppressive system and as much structural independence as is necessary not only to survive in the world but to prosper so education must be defined to specify these purposes as most important the american usa ethic of individualism is inclusive of both basic needs of men and the essence of a social style all men are to some extent selfcentered but to build a social group process on selfcenteredness is to hope for a just order through antagonistic cooperation the thrust of the black university must be to overcome this subtle social warlikestate with the ethic of communalism this means that instead of hoping for social progress through the individual merits of its students or faculty qua individuals progress is to be viewed as a social process through which the community is uplifted with the aid of its contributing people this then means that while students and faculty play a very vital role they are coworkers alongside the equally important others eg the community organizer the artist the union organizer moreover the goal of the university must be one of service to the community the students faculty and administration of the black universitv must consider themselves as servants to the broader afroamerican community being a member of the university must be considered an honor but more important this honor must be one involving responsibility to the total community and not simply focusing on the imadeitbecauseimsmarterthan kind of thinking being servants status is not based on the academic credentials university people create for themselves rather it is on the extent to which the total community is able to reap benefits from the service provided the service of the black university must not be one transmitted through mass communication or ritualistic ceremony but through a concrete programmatic movement toward liberation the time when the afroamerican community must be armslength from its institutions of higher education is over the pimps prostitutes preachers and phds must find a common bond to change themselves and weave an organic unity as the basis for liberation and a better life for all these goals must redefine two dangerouslypervasive patterns found among afroamerican faculty and students today one of the patterns is for education to be simply a process of acclimation and adjustment to the white world one goes to a white school to rub shoulders with them because son you got to make a livin out in their world another pattern is the playculture of friendship cliques and fraternity life whether it is mimicry of whites think of fort lauderdale in the spring or defection based on hopelessness we must find the recipe for a revolutionary discipline consistent with our desire for immediate radical change a free man is also and must be a responsible man and so must afroamerican students and faculty be responsible to themselves by being responsible to the black community the values of the black university must support the liberation movement of afroamericans oppressed people around the world and all that prevents man from leading the good life we must find a synthesis of efficient reason and purposive compassion the value placed on scientific methods must be joined by an equally important value placed on empathy ie sci entific detachment must be limited to method and technique complemented with involvement and commitment the students and faculty must be evangelical in their social roles and give new meaning to being a missionary for freedom and finally the black university must impart to all who are associated with it the strength to be alone the struggle against ignorance just as with the struggle of power is one within which the forces of good are often small in number and sparsely placed an afroamerican of the black university must have inner strength positive historical identity and a vision of the good for only in having these traits will he be able to stand up in a world dominated by evil and be secure even in being alone among its many functions the university is most concerned with knowledge both the accumulated information and insights of human history and the vision and process of new discovery and it is knowledge about afroamericans that is most lacking or biased and wrong in all these respects the black university is based on the fundamental assumption that the afroamerican community is in e franklin fraziers words a little social world a human universe heretofore misused or ignored by higher education consider these autobiographical comments by dr du bois when i went south to fisk i became a member of a closed racial group with rites and loyalties with a history and a corporate future with an art and philosophy into this world i leapt with provincial enthusiasm a new loyalty and allegiance replaced my americanism henceforth i was a negro the black university must respond creatively to just these realities which were true for du bois in and equally true for this author in the s the knowledge of afroamericans just as with africa is yet to be fully reclaimed with the full scope of university activities research teaching etc revision is needed to secure for colored peoples of the world their proper place in human history this revision of educational materials is a process as much political as it is scholarly with scholarly work a text of usa history can be written but only with political influence will it be made available by getting it published placed in a library or adopted as recommended reading however in the present it would be foolish to think of throwing everything aside revision of what is must be a thorough job of systematic and rigorous scholarship backed by the concerted political efforts of afroamerican students faculty and the entire community but more important and more difficult there is a need to find new styles of scholarship new forms of knowledge new ways of knowing these new developments must be consistent with what is to be known and have utility for the liberation movement there must be research on all aspects of the black experience research necessarily not limited to traditional scholarly disciplines but open to the demands of the subject for example the blues component of afroamerican culture demands a historian musicologist literary historian sociologist etc the soul of a people must be reflected in the results of the research as well as the life style of the black university we must be in search of the funky sociologist the soulful political scientist and the university president who can get down these are some of the necessary ingredients of a black university and while we can at best look to the future for its full realization it is quite possible now to suggest a structural outline that reflects these fundamental assumptions about its social and intellectual role the diagram on page suggests three related colleges concerned with distinct areas though bound together in the idea of the university each would be organized around research teaching and practice for every part of the university community there would be centers for international study asia africa latin america international conference center an advisory board of community representatives from all walks of life with the task of providing policy suggestions and guidelines this would insure the community of ties to the specific parts of the university as one enters the university he will be faced with a variety of degree programs and alternative courses of study it is quite clear that the standard fouryear college degree meets only a partial need for the afroamerican community but even the student entering the college of liberal arts would have to work at least a year in one or more of the other two colleges in order to meet the requirements for graduation the general principle might well be that to meet the needs of today the new programs will have to take less time but those set up to meet the needs of tomorrow will have to take more time as a national institution engaged in activities found nowhere else the component colleges of the black university would be of great service to a wide variety of groups service professionals working with afroamericans face a challenge supported by sparse research and little experience the college of afroamerican studies being a center of innovation and discovery concerning these problems will conduct special courses and training programs so that students can supplement their training and experience with a concentrated program there is a desperate need for social workers teachers lawyers doctors psychiatrists etc and the same kind of function is planned for the entire university there also must be connected with such a university a set of centers of international study they will be small centers specializing in specific areas in order that together they might constitute an international program without superficially missing the peculiar character of each part of the world in addition no such university could hope to function without an international conference center available to the university community and accommodating other activities consistent with the aims and purpose of the university community and liberation movement afro americans are moving onto the international scene and so must have at their disposal a center where such meetings can be held as stated at the beginning of this discussion there is no panacea for the afroamerican liberation movement just as there can and will be no monolithic organizational structure but there can be operational unity around such concepts as the black university the first step in moving toward this operational unity moving toward the black university is to begin a creative and honest dialogue among afroamericans but more than that we need small bands of people in positions to act to make steps to be daring enough to risk failure or worse irrelevance it will only be when these ideas can be referred to in concrete terms that definitive statements can be made and the concrete reality of the black university must begin today one last thought the afroamerican community does not possess unlimited resources with which to carry on experiment after experiment each of us who can contribute to the black university must ask himself what he is doing for it what he is doing for this kind of operational unity i am calling for all of the brothers and sisters in other colleges and university settines to come on home and to those at home let us get this thing together the black university a practical approach by darwin t turner ost reform ends in revolution perhaps that will be the inevitable result in any effort to reform higher education for negroes in the united states nevertheless before proposing the revolutionary step of establishing a new institutiona black universityi wish to suggest ways of achieving the desired improvement within the present structure of higher education for fear that the very discussion of this issue may seem to provide substance for those hostile critics who argue that negroes are peculiar creatures always demanding or needing special attention i must point out that the need for reform is not limited to the education of negroes higher education in the united states needs attention it is a mongrel conceived from the forced wedding of the european ideal of educating the elite to the united states ideal of educating the masses students complain about their loss of identity their isolation from professors their inability to receive respect as young adults and their subjection to antiquated or absurd academic regulations hp courses and materials teachers complain about the disinterest of students and about the overemphasis on athletics grants and research administrators complain about the continuous complaining by students and teachers although negroes share in these characteristic and perennial problems of higher education negroes experience additional problems both in the integrated colleges and in the predominantly negro colleges the negro teacher in an integrated institution knows that he exists as a visible symbol of liberal attitudes and practices of brotherhood if he is one in a million he may become the chairman of his department or who is there besides john hope franklin if he is especially astute in his studies of negroes he may aspire to be a kenneth b clark most often however he rises to the lowly post of assistant or associate professor and squirms there the channels to prominence are dammed for him even though his intelligence and training may surpass those of men who rise beyond his rank if he works in a predominantly negro college he generally must live in the south professionally his growth is restricted by the cultural isolation the poverty and the apathy frequently characteristic of such institutions because he may become a professor a dean or even a president he may earn more money than he would in an integrated institution psychologically however he struggles to maintain selfrespect when professional friends accuse him of martyrdom or worse even though the quality of instruction in individual classes may equal that observed in any college in the country widely publicized reports by white men have proclaimed the innate inferiority of such institutions thus as long as he remains attached to a predominantly negro college he too is adjudged inferior or at best an exception a smallsized frog in a muddy cesspool it is no wonder that vacillating between such harsh alternatives negro educators frequently dream of a black university in which they might rise to a level ordained by their talents and ambition while commanding the professional respect accorded to teachers at prestige institutions similarly sensitive negro students feel repressed in integrated institutions prospects are brighter for them than for negro teachers they may be elected to such exalted positions as homecoming queen or president of a club or even a class the only requirement is that they be exceptional in intelligence athletic ability charm or beauty or that the school be campaigning to prove its liberality if they are average or enroll during the wrong year they drop into obscurity where they remain far more hidden than are white classmates of equal talent regardless of their prominence they experience restrictions in social life academically some suffer from the prejudice of instructors who believe negroes incapable of swimming above c level still others intelligent students may suspect that they are being crippled by condescending tolerance their answers are accepted too easily their mistakes are forgiven too quickly they fear that they are being hurried along with good grades by teachers willing to evaluate negroes on lowered standards because after graduation the negroes will disappear into their own world where their ignorance will neither injure nor threaten the white world furthermore whether talented or average these students will be taught very little about the worthy achievements of other negroes as students in a predominantly negro college they may achieve more local prominence as individuals but they have read the studies which advise them and the world that their education is inferior this knowledge creates double dangers first although they resent the situation which labels them inferior by association they subconsciously come to accept the judgment consequently they fail to drive themselves as industriously as they would in integrated institutions and too frequently they protest against the teachers who demand collegelevel work from them second because they lack firsthand knowledge of integrated colleges they assume that each weakness which they observe must be unique to predominantly negro colleges and must be further evidence of the inferiority of such institutions like negro teachers they want to be part of an institution which will afford the opportunity to develop their talents and the prestige merited by their achievements let us therefore dream of the ideal institutionone which will give growth to negro teachers and students alike it is i repeat one which can be developed within the current framework of higher educationif it is to be developed at all endowment a university must have money good teachers and good administratorswhether white or black go where salaries will buy all the necessities and hopefully some of the luxuries money is needed for classroom buildings dormitories staff equipment and supplies predominantly negro colleges have lacked money they have depended upon state legislators churches generous patrons alumni and students except in california legislators spend money for education as grudgingly as a temperance worker gives alcoholics money for liquor generally one statesupported university is favored the rest beg the least successful beggars have been the predominantly negro colleges which have lacked alumni who seated in southern legislatures might trade votes for dollars more limited in funds churches frequently have doled their allotments with the prayer that sacrifice and dedication might substitute for cash donorsboth individuals and foundationshave been generous at times but planning a black university one cannot afford to forget that the majority of philanthropic supporters of negroes higher education are white negro alumni have contributed but deficient in both number and wealth they generally have been unable to provide more than a few scholarships and some spending change tuition has been an important source of revenue but it is a troublesome source raise tuition too high fewer students attend increase the number of students additional money is needed for teachers equipment supplies and facilities furthermore the quality of the student too frequently is lowered when additional quantity is sought an obvious method to use to secure the necessary money would be an appeal to the negro populace to support a worthy cause an average contribution of one dollar for every negro in the united states would furnish working capitalsixteen or seventeen million dollars but will enough negroes contribute sufficiently generously to a single university i fear pessimistically that this ideal institution must continue to depend partially upon contributions from white patronsfederal or private who traditionally weaken in generosity as a negro institution gains in affluence of course in a black state or a black nation it would be possible to secure sufficient money by a minimal tax but i must make clear that i am not considering a black state or nation on the continent of north america although i would be happy to be part of a nation where a black man might be elected president in i do not judge such a nation to be practicable in north america where it would begin years behind the other countries where its creation would require uprooting settled people and where its existence might depend upon consciencecontributions from people notoriously untroubled by conscience when comfort and cash are at stake no i must discuss the possibilities of an ideal institution for negroes within the united states to secure sufficient money such an institution must discover a way to tap the pocketbooks of moneyed negroes as no other negro cause has succeeded in doing all methods must be usedcollections in churches dances by fraternal organizations door to door soliciting telephone and mail canvassing raffles and the solicitors must have substantial arguments to offset the prejudice against higher education the disinterest in national causes and the suspicion of solicitors i curricula in considering second the question of what the negro student should learn i am merely giving high priority to the complaint of negro students that they learn too little about themselves and about ways to improve their community although i admit the justice of the charge i cannot blame anyone except negro faculty membersmyself included unimaginatively we like thousands of white educators have reproduced for our students the same education which we received we have wanted our students to possess the kind of knowledge respected by the semiintegrated society which will surround them after graduation but we have failed to realize sufficiently the need to provide them with additional knowledge required for the segregated society the black society the little circle inside of and ignored bythe large circle we can blame ourselves nothingto my knowledgeprevents predominantly negro colleges from offering any course that is desired i am fully aware that some southern legislators or governors have applied pressure to some negro college presidents in an effort to curb demonstrations i know also that some negro college presidents have succumbed to such pressure or timidly have restricted student activity in anticipation of such pressure certainly having taught in north carolina for nine years i know how legislators may try to restrict freedom of speech fearful of communism the legislature of north carolina banned from appearance on campuses any acknowledged communist or anyone who had pleaded the fifth amendment educators in north carolina understood however that this law was not aimed at the predominantly negro colleges the white legislators scarcely knew nor cared who spoke to the negro students the legislators and their constituents concerned themselves with the speakers who came to the campuses of the large statesupported universities i do not know any instance in which a state official has opposed an attempt to introduce any raciallyoriented course at a predominantly negro college of course i have no primary knowledge of what happens in education in mississippi or alabama those bastions of confederate racism i do know teachers in those states however and have no reason to believe that courses have been denied the fact is that negro educators and i must include myself have not conceived courses oriented to the negro aside from the history of the negro in america a course in literature by negro american writers and possibly a course or two in sociology including a discussion of the problems of minority groups few educators have proposed courses studying the achievements of black men i know no course in the history of art or music of negroes no history of education which includes a study of predominantly negro segregated public schools and colleges no linguistics course which analyzes the socalled negro dialect there should be sociology courses analyzing the structure of the negro community business courses describing methods of organizing cooperative community businesses more courses concentrated on practices in small businesses these courses are desirable can be established and must be established even at the predominantly negro colleges as currently structured the irony is that they may be established first and condescendingly at predominantly white institutions this new information however cannot be substituted for other more traditional knowledge it must be additional i hesitate to use the term supplementary only because some readers may assume that i regard it as less important to the contrary it is significant however if the negro student is provided only with knowledge about negroes then his education will be as restricted as it has been in the past his vision true will be black instead of white but the revisers of the curriculum will be guilty of the same colorblindness and narrow vision for which they condemn the planners of the present curriculum research despite the extravagances committed in its name research is the consort of good teaching a teacher must have information about his subject before significant changes can be made in curricula for negro students considerable research will be needed for shamefully facts about negroes are not known or have been gathered by white researchers too frequently in quickly published studies where a limited sampling was used to substantiate a preconceived generalization about an entire population just as predominantly negro colleges have been compared unfavorably with the ideal of a college or with the prestige institutions rather than with predominantly white colleges of comparable size and endowment so negroes as individuals and groups have been evaluated against the ideal rather than judged in comparison with white peers of similar economic educational and social background new research is needed extensive research is needed there are negroes qualified to perform such research but ways must be devised to provide researchers with the time needed and to persuade foundations to trust negro researchers to conduct scholarly studies of negroes without such research the new courses cannot be offered for it is better to teach nothing than to teach something which is known to be merely a guess f m publishing the black university needs to publish the research of its scholars today white publishers respect research into problems of negroes primarily when it is conducted by white men a negro scholar faculty curriculum research by stephen e henderson s i see it the black university may exist in the following forms as a new institution as an institution already existing in toto and as an institution already existing in part both physically and intellectually now it strikes me that the first choice for practical men is unrealistic and wasteful since the need is immediate and the founding and supporting of a strong institution so costly and timeconsuming that it would unduly diffuse the already too meager financial and professional resources of the black community can we turn then to a black university which already exists in toto the question of course is rhetorical for if one such institution existed there would be no need for a discussion of the desirabilitv of such an insti or tution this consequently leaves us with the third possibility an institution already existing in part physically and intellectually it appears to me that although the black university does not at present exist anywhere in toto it does exist in part in that residue of blacknesssocial cultural and philosophicalwhich is found in the socalled predominantly negro colleges or to use another circumlocution in the historically negro colleges the problem becomes then a matter of modifying some one or more of these institutions personally i have no doubt that such modification is necessary indeed it seems to me inevitable some perhaps many of these schools will survive with relatively little change others will perish either absorbed into their various state budgets or through consolidation or through absorption into the cloudy american mainstream strangely enough this lastnamed fate seems to be eagerly anticipated by many institutions which with few exceptions have sizeable white numbers in their faculties but virtually no white students in their enrollment riesman and jencks have already analyzed this phenomenon so i am content to observe that schools are for the education of students not for the employment of teachers once we accept that simple fact the pathetic absurdity of calling our schools predominantly negro becomes altogether too clear it indicates a curious ambivalence which is characteristic of all of our relationships with the rest of the country we say predominantly negro meaning perhaps that this is a temporary situation that what we really want is to be integrated ie to be a minorityin our own schools why is it that we doubt our own capacity to give our children a quality education or even to raise our children at all that same ambivalence lurks behind the whole thrust of the recent civil_rights movement another aspect of this ambivalence is perhaps the secret wish to retain the schools as predominantly negro ie to retain power and control and decisionmaking in our own hands if that is what we mean then why do we apologize for it god knows its natural enough and its a salutary develop ment to see as a practical expression of black consciousness that parents and teachers and pupils in northern urban high schools are demanding just that kind of control if such a desire is natural then why do the negro colleges equivocate i submit that they do so out of confusion or out of fearconfusion as to their role in a society marked by constant crisis confusion as to the nature of the changes taking place in that society fear of offending their white supporters and faculty and fear of reevaluating the premises on which the institutions themselves are predicated by nature of the problem to which i address myself the schools which best illustrate this anxiety are our socalled liberal arts colleges they represent the heart of the problem since their ultimate function is to shape the students mind and soul in such a way that he can perform most efficiently and happily in his world glancing at random through statements of institutional purpose of many of the schools one discovers quite soon that the purpose actually if stated in fashionable language is to help the student discover his identity through acquainting him with the history the culture and the forms of belief of western civilization even this limited aim has never been carried out on any large scale and it hasnt been done chiefly because as educators we took the passive role and assumed that the experience of blackness is irrelevant to western history and civilization and hence to our students and our own search for identity the single revolutionary concept that has emerged in recent years is that the black experience is not only relevant in such a search it is fundamental and crucial one might almost call it archetypal for from it can be derived not only americas quest for selfhood but indeedsince the black experience is also the type of the colonial experience and reaction to itthe whole modern experience of europe as well how absurd it is then to assume as some critics do that a black university would exist in a vacuum when the question of identitythe question of blacknessis more than a matter of pigmentation when it is ultimately a moral and philosophical position in other words one finally wills to be black this is what the fuss is all aboutalbert cleage adam powell walter white frank silvera willed in varying degrees to be black my firm belief is that by willing to be black in that philosophical sense our schools can make a greater contribution to our personal wellbeing and to the world at large than by any other means that i can presently see what does this willtoblackness entail it entails a certain double vision not the double vision of du bois but a shift in perspective in which one looks inward into himself and the group and sees outward with sharper msight in which one looks backward into his history and his cultural roots and discovers that he is looking forward it is like looking backward in time though one is looking forward in space through a telescope if through this process one discovered god in the actual act of creation and with a new physics we might ones knowledge would be complete vaughan the poet said there is in god they say a deep and dazzling darkness and it is for the reason of this liberating god within us that we must confront our blackness immediately we must confront it because we have to no inconsiderable extent africanized this country that time it was unconscious and passive this time it must be otherwise for unless the values inherent in soul and negritude are made to prevail in this country we may yet find ourselves at armageddon across the seas in our skies and in our own city streets assuming then my estimate of the importance of the black university to be valid i shall briefly discuss what seems to me the feasibility of such an institution first if black college presidents willed to be black the problem would be very much simpler though by no means simple for to some extent philosophical blackness or soul exists in all of our institutionsif not in individual courses then in faculty or students our immediate problem thus is to bring this blackness as it were to a saturation point this means conscious reorganization and concentration of human and other resources preferably as i see it in several regional centers which already exist in the baltimored c area in the norfolk area in the durhamgreensboro area in the nashville area in the atlanta area in the tallahassee area in the new orleans area and in the houston area depending on the degree of cooperation they would become centers of black consciousness or units of a single de facto suprainstitutional black university the simplest thing to do of course would be for college presidents to recognize the schizophrenia implicit in being predominantly negro and simply declare themselves to be black people working especially for the good of black people though excluding no one because of color or ethnic origin their mission being to capitalize on the unique importance of the black experience to this country and to the world if we were honest with ourselves and if national spokesmen for cultural pluralism were serious then presi dents would have no fear of losing financial and moral support indeed the federal government and private industry in such a case should have no qualms at all about paying some interest on that great invisible national debt the vast backlog of salary which they owe us for almost years of economic exploitation but this is too much to hope for and too naive since recent pronouncements by some of our presidents indicate their determination to die the white death while others indicate an unfortunate confusion of a personal revulsion for extremes of pigmentation with the legitimate concern which black students have with the ultimate purpose of liberal educationfreedom through selfknowledge the recourse then must lie in the willtoblackness of the faculty and the students when this will becomes strong enough when it becomes informed in all senses of the word with soul when it reaches the saturation point or better still when it reaches critical mass it will demand institutional restructuringin faculty in general resources and in acknowledged aims some of these changes may take place comparatively rapidly and thoroughly in a few strategic institutions in others they may not occur at all in some to pursue a figure the energy will be harnessed for the good of all in others the result may well be destructive social explosion that the resistance is formidable is obvious to anyone who reads the newspapers that the change will come is equally obvious to all but the blind and the deaf who really have no business at all in the crucial task of educating this new black generation who well may be our last hope for sanity and decency in this country some of the changes i speak of may occur through the following structures regional organization shared resources systematic and continual faculty and student exchange and black humanists and specialists in blackness by regional organization i mean several things the first is the establishment of honest and creative relationships with nonacademic black intellectual communities i mean the establishment of new and respectable relationships with the black nonintellectual communities i mean the establishment of genuine lines of communication between academic institutions in the same region that is exchange below the administrative level this type of organization is admittedly difficult but models do exist the atlanta university center is moving in this direction from this type of regional reorganization could come more concrete objectives shared resources both general and human let us take an example of each first the general by this i mean nonhuman resources such as library holdings art collections and the like i submit that the average black student has no real notion of the richness of the fisk negroana collection or the howard library or the atlanta university negro collections of books manuscripts and paintings fewer students still know anything of the schomberg collection and honesty compels me to say that altogether too few professors know very much about these collections whose fault is it our own but fortunately structures already exist which could make it possible for even the smallest the poorest negro college to will itself to a saving state of blackness as i have suggested its contours above if a panel of artists and critics comparable to the one which set up the recent exhibit of afroamerican painting at city college new york could cull the best and the most representative examples of african and afroamerican art which our colleges possess it should be a relatively simple matter to make slides and reproductions available at a nominal fee even to these colleges both it seems to me lie within the possibility of a title iii grant manuscript material and other comparatively rare items could be made available on microfilm with provisions made for printouts this is just an obvious example a more thorough going proposition would be the establishment of an information retrieval system connected with the regional resources of our best schools and even with the special resources of the nations largest graduate schools i see the irony in this latter statement but what do you do at a black university if someone else has your ancestral artifactsraid the british museum ultimately the purpose of such a system would be to stimulate students and faculty alike to visit the institutions where the originals exist this brings us to the next point human resources these resources are naturally faculty and students the problem of course is to get them together on a meaningful basis across institutional lines now some few students and faculty might be stimulated enough or may have the financial resources to visit schools with special library or art holdings but this is not enough what is needed it seems to me is some plan whereby a continual interchange of ideas and opinions may be insured on a personal facetoface basis this can be done by a system of student exchange between centers of blackness and negro colleges oddly enough a good deal of this was done a few years ago only the exchange was in effect between centers of whiteness and negro colleges i remember a boy from the midwest who left after a few days on my campus suffering i was told from culture shock obviously such a system can work only if the administration of the negro school is sympathetic or apathetic it remains for students and faculty to will the change to create the structure at any rate the visits could last anywhere from a weekend to a semester depending on the academic standards of the institution and other such sticky business a visitation period of a semester would presuppose that the student would find something worth his time in one of the regional black centers what he should find is a group of gifted black humanists who have assembled or have been assembled at a center for the express purposes of the black university as stated above presumably at first there wouldnt be enough of these people to staff all of the schools which may require them presumably some of the schools may not be able to afford to pay them and one couldnt expect them to starve black starvation is still starvation no matter how soulful still it would be possible especially for the politically aggressive and the academically and artistically talented for a sizeable number of students no matter how poor to be brought into dialogue with this group of dedicated and gifted teachers the student might even spend time in two or more such situations obtaining the kind of experience the black university and its community by j herman blake order to become a viable institution and to make a meaningful contribution to the black community the black university must be cognizant of the varied and complex developments among black people these developments should become an explicit part of course offerings in an effort to develop a philosophy and ideology which will permit us to analyze and evaluate social change in the black community from a perspective of blackness the decade of the s will certainly go down in history as one in which major contradictory trends developed in black communities across the nation this is the decade that has seen black people achieve higher political offices than ever before two of the nations major cities have elected black men as mayors another black man was elected as senator from a new england state a black man sits on the cabinet of the president and another black man sits on the supreme court all of these are dramatic and significant firsts for black people in the sixties and they portend further changes with these developments have come other phenomena which indicate the perplexing and troubled situation within black communities for this is also the first decade to see major urban insurrection for four consecutive summers with the most recent outbursts far more severe than any previous ones this is the decade that has seen more and more black militants take up the philosophy of selfdefense when attacked viewing violent action as an effective approach to black dignity and manhood this is the decade that has seen more and more black youth refusing to serve in the armed forces of the united states on the grounds that the nation is engaged in a program of genocide against black people in other lands and within its own confines the nation is also practicing genocide against blacks these contradictory trends amongst black people in americaon the one hand some black men getting more rewards for participating in the system and on the other hand black men refusing to participate regardless of the rewardsmust be taken into consideration by a black university for the contradiction requires some resolution in this paper we shall review several recent and major demographic trends in the black community to shed some light upon some of the underlying variables in this perplexing situation there are a variety of ways in which these changes can be analyzed but we choose to focus upon two general approaches where we were at the beginning of the decade or an earlier point as compared to where we are now and the relative changes in the black and white communities and where these changes leave us in relation to those who so utterly fail to understand our condition the varieties of variables that one might select the different statistical measures that might be applied and the different base populations or starting points make it easy to prove any point one wishes to prove about the black community we hope to avoid this problem in some instances notably income by presenting several measures to show the trends in the black communitv one of the most significant twentiethcentury trends among black people has been the redistribution of the population from the country to the city and out of the south to the north and west this trend has continued into the sixties between and the proportion of black people in the south declined from to percent we should not ignore the fact however that despite a vast migratory trend the majority of the black people still live in the south and blacks make up onefifth of the total population in the southern states in addition to the movement out of the south black people have been moving into cities and the large ones at that in both north and south the recent appointment of a black mayor in washington d c and the election of black men to mayoralties in gary and cleveland is a direct manifestation of the presence of large black populations in these cities over half percent of all black people now live in the central cities of metropolitan areas and the population increase has been fastest in the largest cities in metropolitan areas with one million or more persons black people comprise onefourth of the central city population and the experts estimate that in black people were at least percent or more of the population of of the largest cities in the country these cities and the proportions of their population which are black are as follows washington newark atlanta new orleans memphis baltimore st louis cleveland detroit philadelphia chicago the evidence indicates that more black people than ever before are both interested in education and are taking advantage of every opportunity to increase their knowledge the statistics on the proportions of blacks completing high school and college show some interesting and significant trends in percent of all black males and percent of all black females between the ages of had completed high school however by percent of all black males and percent of all black females in the same age category had completed high school not only was there a dramatic increase in the proportion of young adults with high school diplomas the number of young males completing high school now exceeds the number of young females although the proportions are much lower the same trend holds for those completing college in percent of all black males between the ages of and and percent of all black females had completed four or more years of college by these proportions had increased to percent for males and percent for females if the dramatic increase in high school completions is any indicator we can expect substantial improvements in the number of black youth with college degrees in the next few years it is not at all insignificant in considering a black university to recognize that the educational experience of black youth still takes place in predominantly black schools where the culture of black people is maintained in the inter action of the youth if not in the educational curriculum sixtysix percent of all black youths in the twelfth grade in were in schools which were predominantly black so these youth would probably be more comfortable and at ease in black institutions of higher education despite the movement into cities where occupational opportunity is said to be higher despite higher levels of education the employment situation of black people has changed little from the last hired first fired status since the early fifties the unemployment rate for black people has been about twice as high as that for whites and it has remained this way until the present day although unemployment rates have fluctuated considerably in the unemployment rate for black people went up to percent the highest since but it has dropped steadily in subsequent years it went down to percent in and the decline continued to percent for the first nine months of black people are overrepresented in every category of unemployment during the first nine months of blacks comprised percent of the civilian labor force but were percent of all unemployed workers and percent of those persons unemployed for at least three and a half consecutive months teenagers still suffer the most of those without jobs for in the first part of the unemployment rate for black youth between and was percent more than twice the rate for white youth between and there were substantial increases in the number of black people holding white collar positions and less dramatic but still increases for blacks holding blue collar positions the increase in white collar employment shows the largest gain in clerical and sales positions blacks are still underrepresented in the skilled white collar positions as of with the situation for black males and black females showing some significant differences in professional and technical positions black males represent percent as many as there would be if there were full occupational equality while females in the same category represent percent as many as would be found in a situation of full equality on the other hand in the clerical positions black males represent percent as many as would be found in a situation of full equality while black females comprise only percent these and other data which we have analyzed indicate that the black female has a better chance of obtaining a job consistent with her education and training than the black male in the professional technical and managerial categories while black males are more likely than females to be adequately represented in clerical positions the chronic problems black people face with education employment and occupational levels are reflected in the income levels of the population although the sixties have seen changes in income for blacks there are varying interpretations of income changes in the black community and they produce different conclusions some analysts talk about the income of families while others talk about the income of persons and then differentiate between males and females furthermore income changes can be analyzed in terms of the percentage change in median income the ratio of black to white median income or the absolute blackwhite differences in income let us see how the black situation in the sixties stands up in terms of all these measurements in percent of all black families had incomes under per year percent of all white families were at this level but by this had declined to percent of all families percent for whites the proportion of black families with incomes between and went up from to percent white families declined from to percent between and black families with incomes over went up from to percent in the same period of time with a corresponding increase from to percent for white families these figures are ad rsity by vincent harding ne of the most insistent themes in the literature of black america is the attempt to articulate our awareness of the presence of a certain dividedness in our deepest beings an inner tension which w e b du bois referred to as a twoness of spirit and soul while all americans even those who were here when the others came half a millennia ago are people of a broken past nowhere is the tension so often obvious as within the afroamerican community we are the largest single segment of the nation which holds within itself both east and west both africa and america both developed and developing societies for many of us the tension has been so unbearably painful that we have collapsed it on one or the other side until recently it was more often the western developed side which triumphed now of course there moves among us a renewed consciousness of our nonwesternness and in the ghettos of the land one easily senses that many black men are seeking to build and celebrate a newold nation in the midst of the worlds most developed society any university which grew with integrity out of the ground of our black experience in america would have to reflect and bear the creative agony of that tensionno matter how great the temptation to escape it the life of such an institution would in many ways testify to the westernization of our lives but if it is to make a major contribution to its students and their world the western experience cannot be its most important emphasis more than colleges and universities in this country and hundreds more in europe already perform that task though predominantly negro institutions have long imitated such a direction those of us who seek to build faithfully out of the materials of the afroamerican experience are called to other paths one major strength of a black university would be its internanationalism but its focus would not follow the style of the scores of international studies programs which have burgeoned in american institutions since the korean war instead the uniqueness of our approach to the world would be found in our vision through an unashamedly blackoriented prism in the academic program and in a hundred other less structured ways the black university would seek to explore celebrate and record the experiences of the nonwestern world because of much that we have lived through our focus would be upon that segment of the nonwest which has existed under western domination for the relatively brief span of years or less and which now shakes the world with its efforts to wrench free even within that group our specialty would rightfully be found among the peoples of africa both those who remained on the continent and those who were forced into the new world through the diaspora of slavery this in a peculiar way is our thing and we would have no less reason to build on it in a university setting than brandeis has for building on jewish studies or minnesota on immigrant studies or oklahoma on studies of the american indian in an article of this length it is possible only to suggest some of the directions such a blackoriented internationalism might take in a university context but certain lines are suggestive of the whole in the academic program one of the most attractive aspects of this focus would be comparative intercultural studies of many kinds especially in the humanities and the social sciences for instance in music we would try to develop an understanding of the continuities and discontinuities among the musical styles of africa and those of its scattered children in the northern and southern portions of the black new world the dance and the drama would present obvious analogues for possible study we would also attempt to explore the implications of the strong similarities which a noted literary authority claims he has found in the literature recently coming out of harlem and out of black johannesburg what fascinating insights might courses in comparative black literature produce when we realize that there are sections of cuba and other parts of latin america where african religious practices are alive and prospering it is obvious that the study of comparative religious development is also filled with new possibilities in such a context especially as those who know black folk religion in the united states remind us of the persistent presence of a belief in religious magic here or it may be that in such a setting careful elaboration would be done on a significant interdisciplinary as well as intercultural academic monograph such as lanternaris the religions of the oppressed for here in a study of the messianic movements of the nonwestern world it is clear that history political science sociology psychology and religion encounter and enrich each other few settings would be more congenial to such mutual intellectual fertilization than the kind of institution we envision indeed such a study as lanternaris strongly suggests that the blackoriented university could present a marvelous opportunity for the social sciences in america to break out of their nationalistic trap sociology might include such matters as urban development among black people in nairobi chicago and rio political science could well analyse the forms of resistance to colonial domination in harlem cuba mozambique and vietnam so too might specialists in education try to understand the ways in which indians africans and afroamericans have attempted to rescue their educational systems from the domination of structures and ideologies shaped in england france and white america seminars in nonwestern cultural nationalisms of the modern world might be filled with excitement and profit for those who are trying to discern develop and sustain an afroamerican style of life the academic curriculum would be of course only one of the places in which the unique internationalism of the black university might be expressed special institutes on afroamerican using american in the hemispheric sense culture would abound colloquies on a subject like slavery would engage scholars from all over the new world especially those who still bear the marks which were first painfully known by their ancestors conferences on such topics as the role of women in reemerging societies would simply be part of the breathing of such a school symposia on strategies for social change in the former colonial societies would be sponsoredbut not by the american state department think tanks filled with the varied but constant experience of blackness might be established for the sole purpose of analyzing specific conflict situations from detroit to angola and beyond and suggesting directions of actions and ideology for those who are struggling to break away from the hegemony of the west from such a university there would go out teams of specialists in development whose primary concerns would not include the opening of wedges for american influences rather their search would be for ways in which modernization might be purged of its synonymous relationship with westernization and americanization throughout the black university and in all of its special projects the emphasis would be on the search for new models for new systems for new ways of life free from the suffocating grasp of the most current forms of imperialism not only would specialists be sent out in such a search but other kinds of specialists would be brought in representatives of the anticolonial forces members of liberation fronts religious and educational leaders from the re borning nations would be invited and welcomed in order to give deeper meaning to the searching indeed such a university might well become a sanctuary of sorts for some of the worlds revolutionaries what better way to raise the hard questions which many revolutions often force honest intellectuals to ask such an institution would selfconsciously be orienting its students toward an understanding of and an appreciation forthe myriad ways in which our experiences here as colonials who were brought to the mother country parallel those of our brothers who had to receive the emissaries of countless white fatherlands it would of course also stress the uniqueness of the afroamerican colonial experience as a part of developing this sense of common experienceand common roots summer study and junior years abroad in europe would likely become the exception and black students would move toward latin america africa india and asia for their experience of intercultural exchange and overseas study this direction would of course have significant implications for the languages taught in the institution german for instance might have difficulties both student and faculty exchanges with the nonwestern world would become a regular part of the black universitys life the journal of such a center might well seek to ally itself with the new world publication of the caribbean with presence africaine and with other lesser known publications of the nonwestern intellectuals the university would be serviceoriented in the largest sense of that term it would set up skills banks for developing nations and it would urge those students who do not return to the black american communities to offer their skills in africa latin america and wherever else they are needed and desired conceivably a blackoriented overseas service corps might develop and this would not only provide excellent nationbuilding opportunities but it could become an alternative to action with the united states military forces for it is likely that the international orientation of a black university will create many dissenters to the foreign policy which our armed forces now enforce should it refuse to enter the lists of american foreign policy supporters should it become a significant source of dissent and the center of a search for new ways of international life it is not easy to know how the black university would be funded indeed if it saw reason to move beyond experiments in nationbuilding to the search for a new world society in which nations played a far less significant role its enemies might come from the nationalistic left as well as the right certain monies would not be available others like some connected with black chicago slums or african diamond mining might not be accepted a free black university might be forced into existence for the present that is the problem of other writers and other moments at this moment it may suffice to say that the black university must seek to be faithful to the best dreams of our greatest twentieth century black dreamers from du bois to frantz fanon it should at least attempt to place the rise of the west in proper historical perspective refusing either to do homage toor to be terrified bywhat may well prove to be no more than a hyperactive aberration in the context of mankinds long essentially nonwestern pilgrimage such a service to truth would be no mean accomplishment in itself nevertheless to speak of fanon is to suggest even more for it may be that in its international aspects such an institution might well take as its fiercely driving theme the call of his last chapter in the wretched of the earth there his words were a call out of the darkness of hopeless cynical reaction on the one hand and out of ersatz brightness of imitative european styles on the other it was a call to the lightfilled sometimes blinding gruelling search for new shapes and forms for patterns which deal wisely with the longer lines of history and the deepest needs of men ultimately of course he urged for europe for ourselves and for humanity comrades we must turn over a new leaf we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new man as such his call is heir to all the pitfalls of messianism at most and to the disillusions of aborted hope at least nevertheless it may well be far better that a university should search and reach and possibly fail at the practice of such hope than that it sell out to the highest bidder and live on in the style to which america has accustomed us if it is better to try to do our thing then let us press on towards the black university a by nathan hare oward uni versiv t ty spreads like a il i complex of cancerous sores on a breastlike m hill in the heart of one of the worst sectionsby most criteriaof the district of columbia the university which is drably cached in subdued majesty midway the census tracts heaviest in social disorganization was founded in hypocritical contradiction by an ambivalent general oliver otis howard apparently a godfearing religious fanatic who forewent his ambition to become a minister later a lawyer to gain power through military might and position my office during my first three years as a professor at howard was in a third floor corner of what once was general howards mansion on the campus from there i could see the washington monument and the capitol building just beyond the squalor of washingtons ghetto on the way to the office each day i passed through the confusion and anguish of students waiting in the building to gain admission to the counseling center where their educational fates would be dictated to them by hostile clerks hoping somehow to piece together the debris from overly zealous administrative decrees today viewing howard from a distance of more than a mile yet from the vantage point of an intimate exposure to its inner workings i am able to watch it writhe and quiver caught in the contlict between the new surge for black equality and the deathbed contortions of white supremacy and oppression it is a condition i have known first hand for more than six years and have studied thoroughly with the combined tools of the sociologist and the journalist i learned that howard university which acquired its first set of buildings illegally and became a monument to general o howard and his scheme has never broken entirely free from the grips of a militaryreligiouspolitical corruption with this influence criticized also by the great frederick douglass a colored member of the board of trustees who described the ring as hungry sharks with professions of piety upon their lips there developed in the words of john mercer langston who eventually resigned in protest from his position as dean of the law school the entire law school faculty with himbefore going on to become the first negro ever elected to public office in the united states appeared and grew the feeling that the negro whether as trusteee or member of the faculty is of small account indeed rather a pest only as he serves to give color to the enterprise and with this feeling has constantly grown the idea that the colored youth attending the university are incapable of high intellectual achievement still by the university which opened in with an allwhite faculty and student body had a student body onehalf of one per cent white and a faculty less than nine per cent white today the graduate and professional schools notable in the medical professions where white rejects from white schools frequently have high enough scores to outdistance poorly trained black applicants are fast developing a white majority and this is also the trend for the liberal arts faculty where the average salary is higher for white professors than for black professors at the same rank just prior to the emergence of this trend as howard became the capstone of negro education it also became an epitome of political docility and academic nothingness groveling at the feet of outside mainly government expectations real or imagined and fawning upon white congressional appropriators however in an era of greater access to white colleges and rising negro expectations this footshuffling was proving inadequate as the centennial year approached in the competition for top students and professors faced with this predicament administrators merely intensified their stepin fetchit tactics then in september president james nabrit announced in the washington post a plan to make howard sixty per cent white by a plan opposed by virtually every student on campus to accomplish this goal the university had devised an ingenious program for excluding or and removing black students while attracting white ones some professors were warned by the deans office through departmental chairmen instructed to counsel them that their grade distributions should approximate a normal distribution regardless of the caliber of a given class and specifically should include a minimum of failing marks at the same time it was decided to raise standards by raising by points the required score on entrance tests standardized on children of urban middleclass white exposure many culturally deprived black students would not of course be expected to manage such a score white students who flunked would not need to humiliate themselves enrolling in a precollege sequence at howard hence a proposed special division for students who fail the test would invariably be black these subnormals would have to spend a year preparing to enter the new white howard having failed the test as individuals their selfesteem would further be decimated for they would be set apart as failures and subjected to an egomortifying curriculum first they were to receive a speech course already incorporated at howard frankly calcu lated to force black students to lose their ingroup dialects despite the fact that president nabrit himself has been successful in supreme court presentations in a classical negro dialect such students also were to be given a course in reading skills and simultaneously one in masterpieces of world literature it goes without saying that masterpiece authors would be invariably if not exclusively caucasian still another course was history of western civilization not world civilization as in the case of the masterpieces this curriculum would say to black students who already were failures as individuals that they had no ennobling ancestral roots their kind had produced no civilization worthy of attention no literary achievements and indeed are guilty now of the wrong mode of speech it is true even now at howard within the normal curriculum that a liberal arts student cannot take a course in negro history unless he is a history major anyway i wrote a letter mocking the idea of the whitewash program and the letter appeared in the hilltop the campus newspaper the first issue in september of the centennial year immediately i came under pressure losing first a promotion to chairman of the division of social sciences and other privileges which publicly had been promised me and this was an early object lesson of relentless pressure including subjection to a network of student and faculty spies one day toward the end of september while discussing the effects of urbanization on social norms i criticized the obsolescence of some professed codes of sexual conduct then as if to salvage the class from its shock gave assurances of my abiding adherence to them i told of my efforts the previous year to launch an association of virgins on the campus and that one member grew sick and dropped out and the other flunked out i also explained that the reason howards wall clocks always differed as to time of day was because every time a virgin at howard passes a clock the clock stands still within minutes after that class was over the chairman of my department was calling me in excitedly to say that the dean had said that a student had said that had said that i was the only virgin on howards campus the superiors then proposed to observe my classes and when i refused this unique attention threatened to fire me but backed down when i remarked during the hearing that i had once been the best cottonpicker in creek county oklahoma and that should it ever come to that i could always burn my doctorate and go back to picking cotton after the hearing they sent a letter reappointing me mainly because as they later said in court they feared student disruptions should they fire me during the school year but they nonetheless persisted in threats and harassment warning that if i did not fall in line there was going to be a war late one evening after a heated confrontation with a superior ducked into a middleclass bar near the campus where i encountered a number of older professors their plights surprised and horrified me i decided from then on that if there was going to be a war then i was a soldier and should act like one meanwhile students had been staging protests for grievances which typify universities everywhereagainst curfew regulations and other aspects of the right not to be treated as children the law school students were prominent here led chiefly by jay greene later expelled and now on scholarship in the yale law school and art goldberg a jewish student from berkeley now in rutgers law school their activities consisted mainly of rallies where jay greene and other students would rap to a crowd of several hundred then read resolutions drawn up in legal language and the crowd after being told that the resolutions were to be delivered to president nabrit would joyfully clap their hands and disperse nabrit practically never acted on the resolutions except for a few faint promises even when he was on campus but the procedure was always repeated anyway simultaneously there arose a hybrid political partyprotest group called the student rights oragnization inspired in part by art and jay i accepted the invitation to be its faculty advisor sros membership covered the political waterfront their leaders mainly the editors and feature writers on the hilltop staffwhich later was to prove invaluable regarded themselves as black militants in the responsible sense of the category and had as their heroes the national leaders of sncc though their own style approximated more the style of national core when un ambassador to the un arthur goldberg exboss of nabrit came to howard sro staged a walkout in which i was able to persuade five other professorsall white of courseto take an active part shortly after that some sro members dissatisfied with the moderation of its leaders came to me late february by now with a plan to form a black_power committee they were all freshmen largely unknown on campus except in their dormitories and among their classmates and accordingly asked my aid in composing and reading at a press conference a sort of black university manifesto we called for the complete revamping of negro colleges as they now exist spoke against the emerging desire to make negro colleges predominantly white and generally setting forth a program for transforming negro colleges into black universities with relevance to the black community and its struggle against white racism and imperialism cultural or otherwise this kicked off an onslaught of student demonstrations with now and again some faculty participation and the first real confrontation between howard students and an oppressive administration a rumor grew prevalent on campus that i was going to be eased out in the summer and by midapril it had slipped into television and radio broadcasts one night on the way to my population class i encountered a number of students who inquired anxiously whether the rumor was true i assured them that no such word had come down to me and that the deadline for nonrenewal of twoyear contracts december already had passed inside the classroom i sensed the downcast spirit of the students brought up the rumor and suggested that if there was a howard in september i would very well be there all at once they burst into applause but i knew even then that probably i was passing through my last days at howard and perhaps as a college professor anywhere student uprisings rocked on including a confrontation with a police riot squad behind a girls dormitory the sponsorship of a black is best lecture by heavyweight champ muhammad ali after the administration closed down the auditorium leroi jones in a reading to frequent applause of some of his cathartic poetry on the steps of the school of religion the breaking up of a hearing in which naturallook homecoming queen robin gregory was being tried ostensibly because she had helped me and student huey labrie read the black_power committees manifesto and the interruption of selective service boss general hersheys speech eventually students hanged hershey nabrit and dean frank snowden in effigy and followed this with a successful boycott of classes curiously planned for one day only and reportedly representing efforts on the part of moderate student leaders to grab the protest ball from the black_power committee by now we were nearing final exams and it was decided to wrap up protest until the following fall although a series of six mysterious fires which may or may not have been connected with student activities broke out on campus during the last week or so of school one of them causing a general emptying of the administration building school closed and in the dead of early summer about students and six professors received registered letters of dismissal the manner of selecting the victims was indicative of the general confusion hysteria and inefficiency of the adminstrators who held several private meetings with student spies and faculty informants there were no hearings for dismissed faculty members or students amounting to a direct denial of due process and the chance to confront accusers violating the first and fifth amendments of the constitution of the united states true some middlelevel administrators including clyde ferguson dean of the law school and frank snowden dean of the college of liberal arts went on record as opposing the dismissals dean snowden who reluctantly signed the letters dismissing the professors and who up to that time had risen from one of the favorite howard professors of the late forties to the most hated administrator wrote two letters both prior to the close of school opposing the dismissals one of dean snowdens letters to acting president wormley pleaded in part serious anxiety will arise among other faculty members as to the good faith of the university i believe that the whole matter should be reconsidered before any announcements are made because there seems to me to be a strong possibility that the contemplated action may result not only in serious harm to the universitys position in the academic community but also in creating obstacles for our recruitment of faculty in the future more obnoxious by anybodys the man who cried i am i have often said before to the point of repetition cramps criticism of writine by afroamericans is and should bethe responsibility of afroamerican critics not that black critics are more perspective or analytical or for that matter better writers of criticism but white critics have not in the past as in the present been able to explain or translate black literature accurately this is not heresy but fact and the few reviews that were written by whites of john a williams the man who cried l am little brown support this statement explicitly most good fiction borders on truth iey it is a reflection of the truth if newark and detroit of had not happened one could have in all likelihood read mr williams book with less fear and indeed could have smiled at the uncommon ending one could have contentedly put the book aside as an excellent work of fiction and of course recommended it to friends and associates you know like we recommended the stranger portrait of the artist as a young man black boy et cetera et cetera one could have suggested this book with the same ease and delight as one suggested the early john coltrane however the summer of was not fiction therefore it added a new dimension to this novel the dimension of prophesy as with black music black literature continues to grow extend and ceases to be invisible our literature now cuts and you do bleed mr williams latest book is this type of work a blood bringer causing you to hurt and forcing you to redefine your relationship with your surroundings it makes you open your eyes and enables you to see much more than what is in front of you while reading this book we see through mirrors across continents into other cultures and unconsciously we feelthat is if we are capable of feeling john a williams has written an extensively handsome and dangerous novel jeanpaul sartre said it is true that all art is false he lied or he was talking about white western art the book in question is a work of art that is if art among other things is a creative effort that others can identify with an accent on a particular lifestyle communication a bringer of knowledge a mind wakener movable prose which is esthetically pleasing and meaningful and in essence one artists comment on life as he views it the work of art is the man who cried i am and the artist is john a williams mr williams fourth novel successfully deals with the many acute problems that confront the black writer as well as the black man this novel should be of the utmost interest to the black writer for it covers the literary world of the black writer over a span of about years that whole blackwhite era of interdependency the protagonist is one max reddick who could very well be williams himself a black journalist for a timestyle magazine and a novelist of some stature the main supporting character is the father of black literature harry ames richard wright the action fluctuates between these two men as the novel unfolds we are introduced to facsimiles of the major black writers and white critics of the last years there are characters who resemble james baldwin chester himes ralph ellison frank yerby carl van vechten granville hicks william faulkner and others on the civil and human rights scene there is martin l king malcolm_x and the philosophies of marcus garvey and w e b du bois max reddick is what one might call an internationalist a oncethe members of miss brooks

game by christine reams was so hot that summer that the air stood still and i had trouble breathing sometimes i would sit on the front porch and breathe slowly i felt as if i were breathing the same air over and over again i turned two shades darker that summer i almost got as black as miss mabel the grownups said it wasnt really the temperature it was the humiditywhatever that is anyway it was a blistering hot summer and i hated it our house was probably the hottest one in town we didnt own it or anything like that we only rented three rooms of it miss mabel and her two children mike and jim lived upstairs over us mike was and i think jim was a year younger mike was dark like his mother and jim was almost white looking some of the folks in the neighborhood said that jims father was a white man i dont know anything about that i never saw mikes or jims father mr frank and his wife miss sally lived upstairs on the other side of the house tina their daughter was about the same age as mike and jim the three of them were always hanging around together since i was only seven at the time they didnt want me around in the first week of june miss ruth moved into the downstairs apartment on tinas side of the house i was happy because miss ruth had a daughter janice and i just knew she was going to play with me janice was much closer to my age than the others besides the others swore in blood that they wouldnt play with her naturally i thought she didnt have anyone to play with except me well it didnt turn out that way janice didnt want to play with anyone she was a reader and every time i turned around she was reading her father was a soldier mike said he was in saigon i dont remember the last names of any of the people who lived in the old house we were told to put mr or miss before the first names of grownups and address them that way we didnt know it was wrong until we had grown older by then it didnt matter everybody thought miss ruth was pretty men liked her they were always coming around to see her there was one who used to come around a lot he was very tallmuch taller than my dad who was five feet ten he had curly hair mama used to say that men like that are blessed with the hair their sisters should have had after all whats good hair to a man curlys yellow skin was smooth and soft looking i always wanted to touch it to see if it were really as soft as it looked one of curlys eyes was smaller than the other when he looked at you it seemed as if one eye was looking at you while the other one was looking at something on the other side of the room i used to hang around waiting for curly sometimes i played jacks on the front porch and watched miss ruth and curly out of the corner of my eye she said he was her cousin but one day i overheard miss mabel tell mama that they were the funniest cousins she had ever seen then she laughed mama shook her head sadly and talked about the lord mama knew all about the lord because she was saved i think she was the only person in the whole house who was saved most of the time curly came to see miss ruth at night he usually brought a carton of beer with him we would stay up late playing hide and seek and curly would still be around when we went inside once i even saw him leaving miss ruths house early in the morning then for no reason at all mike jim and tina started whispering and giggling every time curly came to the house on that day the game started i dont remember who started it probably mike he was always thinking of things to do anyway i wanted to play too one evening while mama and dad were looking at tv i went out to play on the porch janice was already there she sat in a kitchen chair on her side of the porch her head was buried in a book and her feet were propped up on the bannister i looked at her with envy she had on a pair of old blue jeans which someone had cut off at the knees and a dirty white shirt my mother wouldnt let me wear shorts i sat down on the top step and took a small rubber ball out of my skirt pocket i tossed the jacks on the floor janice didnt pay any attention to me i bounced the ball on the porch several times but she didnt even look up i waited until tina came out hey tina i said will you play jacks with me tina shook her head no why i asked gotta talk to mike she said cant you play until he comes no hes coming now tina said she rushed to the screen door as mike and jim dashed down the steps just one game i begged listen honey tina said turning to face me do you wanna play hide and seek with us tonight sure okay keep quiet when were talking business she said business i mumbled hey you hey girl i said calling to janice i stopped when i saw tinas dirty look and pretended i was talking to myself i picked up my ones i heard the screen door open as i started my twos i glanced up and saw miss ruth standing next to janice mike whistled softly miss ruth smiled as she looked across the porch at us she was a short thin woman just five feet tall in heels and she always wore heels she looked cool in her pink sleeveless dress i smiled at her shyly she looked like a fragile toy like something you would pick up carefully and hold gently with both hands hello she said in a soft voice she always spoke softly around us i mumbled and looked down at her tiny feet hi miss ruth mike said hi tina and jim said at the same time they looked at each other and giggled miss ruth turned away from us and leaned over janice why dont you play with them she asked i wanna read janice said her voice sounded hard compared to her mothers you read too much miss ruth said she put her hand on janices shoulder honey you ought to play with other kids janice didnt say anything she didnt seem to be listening im going to get some beer miss ruth said shouldnt be gone long if curly comes before i get back tell him to wait aw right janice said miss ruth walked down the steps her small hips swayed slightly from side to side i watched her until she disappeared i looked over at tina she was standing in a comer talking to mike and jim i looked at janice she was watching us with strange dark eyes i held the jacks up and beckoned to her but she seemed to be looking through me i threw the jacks on the floor and picked up my threes im glad to see you back from the army front mike chanted i picked up the jacks and stared at him curiously he marched across the porch hey now he continued im glad to see you back from the army front tina put her hands over her mouth and giggled jim laughed out loud something funny was going on as usual i was left out of it hey hey jim said im glad to see you back from the army front janice looked up at mike and then at jim and tina at first she seemed puzzled then mike began to switch his hips the way miss ruth did janices mouth swivelled up until it became very small her eyes narrowed they were almost closed she jumped up from the chair and slammed the door as she went inside the house mike and jim marched over to janices side of the porch i hesitated only for a few seconds before joining them im glad to see you back from the army front i shouted in a high pitched voice the lights went out in janices living room im glad to see you i stopped abruptly janices skinny face peered out the window facing the porch she made a fist brought it up to her nose and shook it at me startled and frightened i backed over to our side of the porch jim mike and tina were still chanting when miss ruth and curly walked into the yard curly was carrying a sixpack of beer under his arm his light skin was brightened by his yellow shirt he didnt wear a belt his hips held his brown slacks up and they looked as if they were going to fall down wheres janice miss ruth asked looking around aw she went in mike said miss ruth thanked him with a smile before entering the house she and curly stopped at the door and whispered together for a few minutes afterwards they went inside of the apartment and janice dashed out as quickly as she had dashed inside mike never stopped when he had a good game going army front was a good game every time one of us marched across the porch janices eyes would get narrow and her mouth would shrink we didnt have to say anything all we had to do was march one afternoon when we were all on the porch mike jumped down the steps and ran down the sidewalk for about a block he turned and marched back toward us he stopped in front of the house and looked around then he marched into the yard and up the steps jim dashed over to janices side of the porch and stepped inside of the screen door he put his left hand on his hips and patted his hair with the other one well hello wife mike said he stopped in front of the screen door tina and i giggled it aint hello wife i said its hello darling only white folks talk that way mike said i started to disagree but then i had never heard dad call mama darling maybe mike was right hello wife mike said again im back from the army front jim opened the screen door and stepped out on the porch hello husband he said he put both hands on his hips im glad to see you back from the army front he chanted softly ohhhh tina said running her hand through her short nappy hair oh my hair is so curly so curly janice looked like an animal about to attack i really do have that good stuff tina continued its so curly hey now aint i got curly hair she marched across the porch with mike and jim suddenly i was acting crazy too im glad to see you back from the army front i shouted we thank the lord for your return tina said she threw her hands up in mock prayer oh were so glad to see you back from the army front yes lord were glad to have him back aint we glad to have him back yes lord we is i still love curly hair jim said sadly i just love curly hair do you love curly hair everybody loves curly hair mike said shut up janice screamed throwing her book on the floor shut up you say one more word about my mama whos talking about your old mama mike asked you just say one more word one more word she whimpered and ill knock the shit outta you im gonna tell your mama i said impressed in spite of myself you said a bad word janice enjoyed herself for a few minutes be too late after i knock it outta you im really gonna tell now i said you gonna knock the shit outta me too mike asked he strutted up to janice and pushed his chest out until his body touched hers go on hit me i dare you he said as he looked down into her face hit me hit me i dare you you say one more word about my mama she said we aint talking about your old mama tina said yeah i said drawing courage from the others were just playing a game were just playing army front aint we just playing army front mike thrust his face into janices and laughed im glad to see you janice grabbed him by the throat he tried to pry her hands away from his neck she wouldnt let go then he hit her in the face she swung at him so hard that they both fell on the floor cmon mike jim shouted get her get her tina shrieked i was shocked mike was on the bottom janice was sitting on his stomach bashing him in the face with her fist jim couldnt stand it any longer he jumped on janices back and pulled her off his brother then tina leaped on janice and the three of them wrestled her janice bit kicked and swung her fist wildly the noise grew louder and i was afraid mama would hear us i backed to our side of the porch and sat down on the top step all at once i looked up and saw mama standing at the screen door she stepped out on the porch her face was wet with perspiration and her stomach stuck out so far that it looked as if she had swallowed a watermelon whats all the noise for she asked crossly tina mike and jim released their hold on janice and stood up i stood up too janice rose slowly her nose was bleeding she wiped her face on the bottom of her blouse we all looked ashamed and guilty the way youre supposed to look when grownups catch you doing something wrong but janice put her hands on her hips and glared at my mother with blood still dripping from her nose she looked as if she were going to attack mama mama looked at her with distaste well mama said she waited for an explanation its all her fault mike said quickly sure was mama i said we was out here playing minding our own business miss dorothy tina said then she starts fighting and carrying on sure did mama she said a bad word i said shes always causing trouble miss dorothy jim said cant nobody get along with her do you know what she said mama i said eagerly i dont want to hear none of her nastiness mama said you little heifer why dont you stay on your side of the porch if you cant play nice like the others i am on my side janice said if i had spoken that way i would have been whipped dont you talk back to me mama snapped i dont play with children janice closed her mouth tightly even though she was silent she looked defiant mama was furious she couldnt bear to have anyone stand up to her again i was impressed with janice i dont want to hear no more foolishness from any of you mama said i looked away from mama to the other side of the porch and i saw miss ruth peering through the screen door at us i didnt know how long she had been there nor what she had heard my face grew hot with embarrassment and shame for the first time i really began to feel the summer heat miss ruth opened the screen door and poked her head out of it apparently she had been sleeping for she wore a red bath robe which was unfastened she held it together with one hand whats wrong she asked in a soft voice these kids are fighting again mama said she looked at miss ruth as if she were looking at sin itself i done told em i dont want no more of this foolishness if they disturb me with their noise one more time im gonna give every one of them a good whipping no matter who they belong to she looked at miss ruth to see how she would take her threat miss ruth came out on the porch and let the screen door close she put her arm around janice miss dorothy miss ruth said quietly i know you mean well but i dont let no outsiders touch my child if she does something wrong you tell me and ill punish her miss ruth mama lowered her voice to match miss ruths a body cant be everywhere all the time we cant always see the devilment our children start miss ruth smiled faintly thats true miss dorothy she conceded her small mouth lost its softness i try to do right by everybody mama continued when a body sees betty doing wrong they know they can chastise her its gonna be the same for this one here she touched her stomach you do what you think best for your children miss ruth said but nobody better touch my janice why i dont whip her myself i can believe that mama said i suddenly had a vision of miss ruth attacking my mother the way janice had attacked mike could little miss ruth beat up mama or would mama beat up miss ruth what would daddy say when he came home and found that mama had beaten up miss ruth i didnt like what was going on she dont have no bringing up at all mama continued youd rather carry on with that oneeyed boy than to do right by your own child mike exchanged a glance with tina and they laughed jim with his hands jammed in his pockets leaned against the wall i began to feel uneasy and hot i didnt want to play army front any more i just wanted everybody to stop talking dont talk about my mama janice said suddenly her voice was almost a plead see there talking back to her betters already mama said i always say you reap what you sow and somedav this child here is of gonna pay you back for not doing right by her dont say no more hush miss ruth said to janice i dont mean no harm mama said but i believe in telling things the way they is now you can live the wild life in this world but youre gonna have to come before the lord in the next one mamas voice rose as she began to feel the spirit miss ruth was speechless everybody was quiet i was getting hotter i felt water running off my back for a minute i was afraid that mama would feel the holy ghost then she would begin shouting and thanking the lord for being good enough to feel the holy ghost ive lived a good life mama continued didnt go running around and carrying on and leaving a child to go every which way dont talk about my mama janice said she was breathing hard now mama looked at her sadly i dont fault the child none its your teachings thats making her what she is look at betty she never talks back knows better than to try it miss ruth glanced at me quickly and i tried to back away from her look dont you say be quiet miss ruth said harshly then make her shut up janice screamed make her shut her damn mouth miss ruth released her robe and slapped janice across the face bewildered janice backed away from her mother they looked at each other for a long time they looked as if they both were going to cry janices mouth trembled she jumped off the porch steps and ran down the street miss ruth looked at mama with tears in her eyes im sorry she mumbled i dont know whats wrong with me i know better than to fuss with you in your condition i know i aint living right miss dorothy she said but i dont mean no harm i just cant help myself i dont mean to hurt nobody never hit the child before in my life dont know whats wrong with me pray for me miss dorothy pray for me mama wiped the perspiration off her forehead with the back of her hand ill pray for you she promised i looked around for mike he was whispering something to jim and tina they were probably making up a new game or thinking of new ways to play the old one i didnt want to be with any of them anymore while mama and miss ruth were discussing mamas condition i walked off the porch then mama yelled at me i didnt run or anything i just kept walking down the street betty mama yelled you get yourself on back here i didnt turn around i just kept walking i found janice in the alley about a block from the house she was lying face down in the middle of the street whatre you doing i asked as i walked up to her go away she said i hate you too she looked funny there was dirt and blood all over her face cmon get up im gonna stay here forever she said until i die you gonna get run over i said i dont care i wanna die why i asked who cares she asked i thought about her question for a while i didnt know what she meant by it but i knew that i didnt hate her and i didnt want to make fun of her anymore i i care i said cmon janice get up as usual janice didnt pay any attention to me i hate everybody she said i hate mama too im gonna stay here till i die then shell be sorry i was already sorry about everything please get up i said fighting back the tears she wouldnt move i walked over to the sidewalk and sat down i wasnt in any hurry to go home i knew i was going to get it when i got there it wouldnt be any little old slap either besides i knew janice couldnt lie in the street forever people drove their cars through that alley and one way or another they would make her move i sat for a long time thinking about janice miss ruth and mama finally janice got up and came over to the sidewalk she sat down next to me i didnt know why she moved from the street maybe she thought that someone cared after all maybe she just got tired of lying there anyway she moved we sat there for a while longer i didnt look at janice because i didnt want to cry and i think maybe she didnt look at me because she didnt want to cry either especially one at a predominantly negro institutionis suspect his intellectual inferiority is assumed if he is writing about negroes his bias is presumed it is a painful jobbut a factthat when a white man studies the culture of negroes his work is sent to another white man for appraisal when a negro writes about negroes his work is sent to three white men what is published and publicized consequently generally repeats whatever white men already believe about the negro what is needed is a negro press a black publisher that will publish and publicize the booklength research of negro scholars i first heard such a request in after a decade negro educators and businessmen have not taken the first step towards such a company negro publishers of magazines evidence their fears that negroes will not buy scholarly publications for they have concentrated their effort and money on periodicals with popular appeal unfortunately they may be correct langston hughes was among those who years ago deplored the unwillingness of negroes to buy books hughes of course referred to popular booksfiction and poetry interest in scholarship is even less faculty negro teachers are needed but the task of securing them is not as simple as might be presumed from listening to the bright young educators who demand a black university let us assume that we are considering establishing a university of studentssmall by standards of the prestige universities colossal for a negro institution let us also propose one teacher for every students certainly not a farfetched standard for an ideal institution that amounts to only teachers plus administrators and secretaries only but that number will not be found among negroes who earn graduate degrees in i do not propose to exclude arbitrarily any candidate who lacks a doctorate degree nor do i wish to denigrate the intellectual ability and the enthusiam of people who may apply but desire is not sufficient knowledge and teaching ability are required furthermore because instruction must be provided in all areas of the curriculum even the capable and welltrained instructors must be screened to make certain that their qualifications are supplementary rather than duplicating for instance it is useless to have four teachers welltrained in zoology if there is no one sufficiently trained in botany since sufficient teachers cannot be secured from new graduates not already committed to particular institutions it will be necessary to raid the faculties of established institutions as anyone knows who has tried it money does not always prove sufficiently strong to pry a teacher from an institution and a community where he has planted roots for himself and his family in time a new institution with sufficient money and satisfactory fringe benefitssuch as geographic location adequate library limited teaching load and cultural activitiescan build as satisfactory a faculty as did duke and chicago to name only two institutions which competed successfully with wellestablished institutions but time is required a decade may not be an unreasonable minimum meanwhile it may be necessary to develop the program at an institution already established for one may strengthen a competent faculty more quickly than create a new one naturally the institution must be selected carefully and means must be devised to exclude from the programor at least minimize the influence oftenured faculty members who apathetic incompetent or hostile cannot contribute wholesomely administration negro administrators have been criticized for incompetence autocratic behavior and egocentricity although the charges are often justifiable competent administrators can be secured from among those already in higher education like teachers however administrators may be unwilling to abandon established posts to gamble with uncertainty i cannot easily condemn a manblack or white who hesitates and finally refuses to dedicate himself to a cause which may require his sacrificing everything which he has spent a lifetime building perhaps therefore the proposed program should be placed under the jurisdiction of a president who has demonstrated excellence at an institution already established before rejecting this suggestion let us examine the major objectionsthat is the criticisms traditionally hurled at negro administrators autocrats have governed and do govern some negro colleges but the negro race owns no monopoly on tyrannical presidents autocratic administration may develop wherever a weak insecure faculty surrenders its rights there is little need to fear that autocratic practices will govern the ideal black university first the president will already have demonstrated excellence competent administrators recognize that educational programs work best when the faculty assists in determining policy second the strong faculty required for the ideal institution will not surrender its rights negro administrators also are accused of incompetence again the failing should not be identified with a particular race incompetent white men preside over colleges just as incompetent negroes do conversely many negroes administer programs effectively just as white men do the fact that some presidents have proved to be incompetent merely emphasizes the need to select a president carefully some men cannot cope with the rapid expansions of colleges today for example an administrator who has governed successfully as a fatherinresidence for a family of five hundred students and seventy teachers may learn that his methods fail when the population doubles traditionally ministers and professors have been selected as presidents of negro colleges ministers are presumed competent to guide the moral as well as the intellectual development of students it is further assumed that brilliant professors can reshape the curriculum imaginatively and can stimulate academic performance characteristic of their own work the fact is however that the complexity of college administration today requires the talents of a corporation executive rather than those of a scholar or a spiritual counselor higher education is big business some key administrator on the campus must know how to secure grants how to organize staff how to handle personnel how to prepare and present budgets and proposals in short someone must know how to operate a big business successfully ideally therefore some top administratora vicepresident perhapsshould be experienced in business management but how many negroes have been given the opportunity to exercise their talents as executives in large corporations whereas some white colleges may complain that they cannot find business executives willing to accept lower salaries as vicepresidents negro colleges must complain of the scarcity of negroes with sufficient executive experience to serve even as visiting consultants an ideal institution needs a triumvirate of key administrators one man experienced in managing a corporation who manages the operation a second man an imaginative scholarwho spearheads the academic program a third man knowledgeable about budgets taxes and law who serves as financial officer naturally as a scholar i would name the academic man to the post of president each of the three however is essential to a successful operation and each must find sufficient prestige and satisfaction in his own position that he will not seek to usurp the responsibilities of the other two new programs and experimentation the new courses proposed earlier do not complete the academic reforms which are needed new curricula must prepare negro students for occupations previously closed to them many predominantly negro colleges starving financially cannot afford the additional expense of new programs no matter how desirable they may be for example if only five students seek training for college personnel positions an impoverished institution may argue that it cannot afford to offer such a program instead it will continue to prepare the fifty students interested in elementary and secondary school counseling thus colleges economically forced to perpetuate the traditional fail to prepare negro students for new occupations the black university may suffer similar financial hardships yet it must offer new programs otherwise it will betray its students and in fact may lose prospective students to larger universities which can afford such programs the black university also must discard the characteristic conservativism of most negro institutions fearing criticism for failure negro institutions rarely have gambled on educational experiments many of the socalled experiments in curriculum and method merely revive antiquated and abandoned practices or these experiments abandon academic standards under the pretext of respecting the socalled culture of the negro experimentation must be encouraged there should be experiments in methods of teaching experiments with nongraded courses experiments with tutorial sessions but experiments must be conducted systematically control groups should be compared with the experimental groups and student performance should be tested and evaluated always the experiment should be designed to discover the most effective means of achieving desired results never merely to confirm the validity of a predetermined hypothesis possibly experimentation will prove that many students cannot reach the required level of competence within four years if so the students must be retained longer college education thus will not be envisioned as four years of courses producing a diploma as automatically as nine months of development produce a child instead it should be viewed as the movement toward a goal the duration determined by the knowledge stamina and quickness of the student the need for new programs and experimentation is a problem for all of higher education not merely for negro institutions i must reemphasize however that the term experiment or curriculum development should not mask a condescending acceptance of inadequate performance by negroes for example some educators currently advise teachers to respect the dialect and the culture of negro students since no studies have determined what that dialect is some educators would accept all habits of language usage no matter how far they deviate from the standard since studies do not describe the negros culture some educators excuse irresponsibility for example as characteristic of that culture such permissiveness further injures the negro student who after graduating seeks a professional or technical position the professional world expects that college graduates will use language identified with professional people and that they will demonstrate responsibility for example few employers will hire secretaries who will say i aint got none of them whether the secretary speaks with the accent of boston or charleston does not matter but the employer expects a different level of usage the employerblack or whitedoes not care whether the secretarys parents and friends speak that way he assumes that if she wishes to retain that pattern of usage she should work among them rather than impose her dialect on his business similarly no one whether a white man or a raceproud black manwants an irresponsible doctor or even an irresponsible plumber theatre music art the black university should provide a training ground for young actors playwrights composers musicians and artists no theatre today provides adequate opportunity for struggling actors and playwrights to develop their talents once again the problem is not restricted to the negro a young white playwright experiences equal difficulty in gaining experience by staging his dramas we are concerned however with the development of negro artists an adequately financed university should be able to maintain a resident company of young writers and performers who could share with students their professional experiences limited though they may be and who would have a stage on which to develop their talent similarly the black university must house a substantial collection of works by negro writers and scholars and a museum of art by black men both collections require money and the services of fulltime directors who have time and travel expenses to search for the necessary materials the resident company the library and the museum can be established and maintained as easily at a predominantly negro institution already established as at a new institution trustees if i seem indifferent to trustees the reason is only that as a teacher and quasi or semiadministrator i have considered trustees only as businessmen who give the blessing of the practical world to the dreams of educators i foresee less difficulty in securing trustees than in securing anything else for the black university jackie robinson ralph bunche mayor carl stokes of cleveland or mayor richard hatcher of gary publisher john h johnsonthese are only a few who are possible trusteesallblack or allnegro or allafroamerican or whatever you wish to call those peoplecan be found prestige the final need of the black university is for prestige even newly established white institutions require time to build reputations but i fear that in america a black university will never earn national reputation as long as it uses only black teachers to instruct only black students and i wonder how long negro students will retain pride in their institution unless that pride is respected by nonblacks this is perhaps the final reason reaffirming for me my original conclusion that the desired results may be obtained more effectively by building upon an already established predominantly negro university rather than attempting to establish a new institution secure the necessary money whether from black men or white men and add this to the money already in the budget of a school secure administrators whose talents supplement those of a competent administrator who already has experience secure teachersblack or whitewho have the knowledge and the ability to teach the desired courses and use them to strengthen a staff which already has numbers and competence accept students white or blackwho wish to experience the education provided then revise the curriculum to meet the needs and demands what results will not be the black university for it accepts white money white faculty and white students but it should be the kind of institution best designed to provide adequate opportunity for black teachers and students to develop their capabilities fully to serve the black community effectively to gain pride in and knowledge of their heritage and themselves and to achieve recognition for their ability and these after all are the major purposes for which a black university is proposed standards were the methods of selecting dismissed individuals dr nabrit saidall the people have uniformly said weve used the scholarship methodweve read in the paper somewhere rightly or wrongly that these people were in some way associated with the disturbance and thats a scholastic way to approach the situation george hayes howard attorney assumed a lawyer calhoun demeanor and wailed that there has been a suggestion of black powwuh delivered in the baptist preachers fireandbrimstone tones he further insinuated that i had caused the fires reading a statement from an article on howard i had written in the washington free press there i had said of the administration they dont seem to hear the thunder and so the boycott last wednesday the fire next time obviously employing the titles of two wellknown novels about the racial scene in a confidential report to his superior the associate dean of students carl anderson set forth ludicrous and needless to say erroneous conclusions based on the viewing of a film by members of the staff and two students employed as spies the film of a hershey hearing had been turned over to howard by a local television station whose white reporter had gotten into an argument with black militant students outside the building and was knocked down and hospitalized the trouble with this was that the howard investigators had a film with no sound consequently they watched anthony gittens in the room legitimately as a witness and jay greene who sought to bring the militant crowd under control and concluded from that that they were inciting the crowd to rebellion the confidential report also erroneously declared the black_power committee under the control of sncc and the communist party and labeled the father of one student a communist the report listed the names of members of the black_power committee only one of them was actually a member one student who was listed as a member art goldberg was white from this kind of evidence an ad hoc kangaroo disciplinary committee of faculty officials meted out punishment from dismissals to warnings and dormitory purges to students including andre mckissick daughter of cores floyd mckissick faculty members dismissed were merely outspoken faculty members whose contracts conveniently expired that year they had violated the cult of mediocrity originated in howards early years when christian character and republican principles were just as political docility is now the prime prerequisites for employment and promotion the only other accusations aside from acting president stanton l wormleys labeling of me and prof ivan eames as fellow racists came from president nabrit who was almost never on campus who said that there had been shovings and some kind of physical contact these teachers had been involved in this kind of activity this of course was a baldfaced lie in the recent months four additional professors of unquestioned professional performance have been refused reappointment apparently for political views more retaliations are to come with each years expiration of contractsas things now standuntil all persons of a divergent political hue have left in disgust or been dismissed when news of last summers firings reached me i had been lecturing at the university of wisconsin at milwaukee after some weeks i returned to washington and suggested in passing when responding in the local press to nabrits boasts of his past civil_rights legal work that at least now having outlived his usefulness after serving well in his day and receiving his reward he should have the decency to get out of the way i left town again shortly and nabrit who had one year left before reaching the mandatory retirement age and who had spent half of the previous year officially working away from howard as a salesman of lbjs foreign policy announced his retirement i was sitting at a conference breakfast table when i read this in the washington post and i immediately exclaimed to my companions that it was a propaganda a public relations stunt my skepticism was based in part on long exposure to the conniving dishonest approach of the howard administration later i was to learn that howards public relations director who highlighted the hershey affair when the selection of student defendants clearly indicated that the black_power committee was the target had received a special citation from the american association of college public relations officials he also played up the black_power issue after the firing of six professors four of them white and i the only black_power advocate in the six unfortunately a group of dismissed students and faculty members misread nabrits resignation as did just about everybody else and called a press conference to announce it as a victory for our cause they also suggested kenneth b clark a member of howards board of trustees as a successor to nabrit which caused me to exclaim unconsciously aloud as soon as i had read it i was aware that if you write a book called tan ghetto people will think you moderate dark ghetto a militant and black ghetto a flaming radical hence it did not surprise me a few paragraphs later when i read that clark had denounced our movement as psychotic while commending the ways of nabrit in september nabrit was to announce that he had never written a letter of resignation and would not indeed that he might defy the mandatory rule and stay on several years then the day after the first fight of my current boxing comeback in december in which i won by a knockout in minutes and seconds of the first round nabrit announced in the press for the second time that he would not retire we went to court in augusti belatedly and reluctantly for i felt that that would turn the matter over to the mercy of the great white courts which might rule on a legal technicality rather than on pure justice also howard students and teachers should any still care or remember by september would tend to accept the courts decision as infallible or equally as bad await it passively our lawyers assured us that the case would be over by september and i felt i had to go along because other faculty members thought that my staying out would hurt their case the judge who handled it an octogenarian had a reputation for conservatism as well as for making the wrong decision in the opinion of the courts of appeals where the case is now we did not therefore expect a favorable decision and time and again during the courtroom proceedings the biased and illogical comments of the elderly judge brought down the courtroom in laughter i discovered meanwhile that the members of the black_power committee had been imprisoned in a summer riotprevention roundup of black militants in this case for conspiring to incite a riot as bail money could not be raised for them at the time they could not return to howard this left me standing on the battlefield with no forces and so i worked along with other student leaders who planned a boycott for september i also remembered all the help local black leadersnot to mention howard students and professorsunsolicited by mehad promised throughout the preceding year and i planned at last to solicit their aid however student leaders were strongly against outside forces then just before school started the students were reinstated though most of them went elsewhere generally to better schools one of them is said to have told the other students to work on forming a student judiciary committee instead of risking protest i personally heard a dismissed professor discourage rebellion before he left for another college student leaders and professors posing as militants echoed this advice now students who previously had urged me not to round up and bring in outside forces informed me that there would be no boycott and suggested that i use the outside forces they had just learned that members of the black_power committee which had stolen the campus leadership from the liberalmoderate student establishment the year before were now away in jail at about this time the local affiliates of newarks national black_power conference formed a washington committee for black_power of which i was elected chairman i sought help with the howard movement from them and from other black militants but none came forward nor did any black group raise funds or contribute to the bill for court costs although some area white professors held a fundraising party and some american university students held a fundraising concert howard students did nothing along these lines although the militants put on a party to raise bail money for a person never connected with howard and who had in fact help persuade the washington committee for black_power to evade the howard struggle on the formal opening of howard a walkout was planned by militant students for president nabrits address only three professors again all whitecould be persuaded to take an active part keith lowe harvardtrained english professor who had been part of the summers purge stood with me on the sidewalk to greet students and faculty members walking out of the auditorium as students gathered round and cheered the voice of professor lowe an oriental reared in jamaica grew hoarse as he implored i have seen you act as full human beings dont let your struggle slip back i warned the students that the only hope is to close howard down indefinitely until a ruthless helterskelter administration buckles under in repentance i did not know that that also had been the view of mordecai johnson former president of howard when the congressional appropriations committee attemped to suppress academic freedom at howard early in the mccarthy era but as in the case of last years boycott student militants mistakenly seeking wide participation had turned the leadership of the protest over to establishment students i know now that the major reason for the black_power committees relative strength last year rested in its exclusiveness although this angered many students who regarded themselves as black radicals and had reputations for constant espousals of the glory of blackness and revolutionary rhetoric these students may still be found at this game beating their chests and reading and parroting frantz fanon and maotse tung and it is clear now that they cannot be expected to do much else then there are the grand organizers i recently attended a unifying meeting of the representatives of different groups each proposing to have the cure for howards ills when i finally left the meeting at midnight they had not managed to get together on anything other than the prohibition of campus activity by any single membergroup later learned that they agreed on a collective name whose acoustics formed an african word but they have done nothing since which rememberis what they agreed that no membergroup should do anything this nothingness pervades the air at howard although steve abel student chairman of the united black peoples party appears to try hard and to mean business but he has little or no help and freshman class president michael harris who has much promise but has not yet had the time to lose his faith in the lies and promises of howards administration and establishmentstudent leaders did stage a sitin in president nabrits office protesting compulsory rotc against abels will the students were persuaded by establishmentleaders to break up the sitin on the promise that nabrit would eliminate compulsory rotc this promise may yet be fulfilled but in any case at best it is a paper victory in more than one sense of the word understand me there still are maybe truly militant students left at howard which would be enough to detonate the movement should they ever manage to shake off the control of the administrations student flunkies studentlounge radicals and other phonies adrienne manns editor of the hilltop for example has done a brilliant job along with anthony gittens chairman of project awareness in making students aware also it is said that time makes more converts than reason and it may come to pass that the next time nabrit announces his retirement howard students per cent of whom oppose his administration according to a hilltop survey may have the courage to run him out of town as of this writing the atmosphere at howard appears to the casual visitor to loom thick with the sickness of a strange and eerie apathy administrators cling to the erroneous notion that a university can stand upon guns cunning and connivance unwary it seems of the fact that history is a vengeful lady and when once it retaliates can be a vicious executioner students and professors walk around virtually wrapped in a cautious trance as if ready to run at the sound of boo some wear the faces of grinning mummies hucklebucking no less in mock glee in and out of the punch out and other student hangouts i walk through the campus on occasion and now and again students wave or grin at me or come over to shake my hand and to inquire about my welfare and it saddens me to see that they are not concerned about their own it is sadder still to see in their faces and reactions and frequently frank apologies and rationalizations a recognition that they have played into the hands of dishonesty and disgrace to their own heritage bartered away selfrespect for insulation against the risk of delay or inconvenience in getting themselves ratified no pun intended for the rat race they feel lies ahead some of them may never realize how cheaply they sold out but students unlike professors are not stuck forever in the cesspool of howards mediocrity many will be able to shake off the crippling influences of their college years and someday reclaim their lives elsewhere and make full contributions to the world and to their race the professors who remain must either face dismissal or be left to quiver aimlessly in the quicksand of induced docility i have watched them day by day young professors with style and promise already losing their spark grumbling in the dark but falling silent and teethy when administrators walk by old men now dissatisfied but powerless at this late date to move driven to drink in bars near the campus discussing the books begun five to years ago which their frozen pens will now never finish the day before christmas eve i stopped by an asylum to visit a former howard professor and friend incarcerated there he had been one of the deans of negro literature and black thought in the days when howard was in its heyday sought out for guidance by a generation of black students when howards faculty directory read like a whos who among negro scholars in late november someone had told me how he stood in a faculty meeting and angrily threatened should howard go through with a proposal to give all this years honorary degrees to white individuals he would write exposes which would make nathan hares seem mild within two weeks they compelled him to retire leave of absence beginning the second semester until the end of the year and then goodby after over thirty years on the faculty in a few days he was taken by force to st elizabeths hospital coming down the corridor on the day of my visit he looked well for his age and in good health on approaching closer he recognized me and refused to see me stating that he did not wish to see anybody from howard again i am glad i was a howard professor but i also am glad that howard fired me penniless writer he travels the gamut from beans and ham hocks to plush meals in europe he leaves the negro paper for a more profitable position on a liberal white one his published novels become a measured success so successful that one eventually goes into paperback he joins the white house staff as a speech writer for a kennedytype president and leaves unhappily because the president doesnt use any of his speeches he emasculates his manhood through his relationships with black and white women and soon becomes a carboncopy of that white boy lillian patch who is killed because of an abortion was of course the prototype of the negro professional woman one who had acquired all the white values of her society and who wished to live those values lillian and max would have gotten married had max had a better paying job and had he moved more swiftly into the american mainstream max made the mistake of letting lillian wear the pants and in effect lost himself and lillian after a short depression period brought on by the death of lillian max is regenerated through a job with the new york centurya liberal white paperand the publication of his third novel after a successful stay at the century max leaves and joins pace a timestyle magazine and works his way up to chief of its african bureau the scene of the novel shifts from the united states to africa and europe while in africa we learn such things as the truth about the african slave trade that black africans own a very small percentage of their land that the black masses of south africa with its own system of apartheid have a higher standard of living than the masses of africans in other areas of the continent we learn that the majority of black leaders in the independent nations of africa are just as devious selfish and prowestern as the black middleclass in the united states in europe we have glimpses of jeanpaul sartre albert camus and the whole frenchblack intellectual association as in the europe of hemingway pound eliot joyce and fitzgerald black writers are not wanted or needed finally while we are in europe we come to the revolutionary discovery of the king alfred contingency plan for the detention and systematic extermination of the afroamerican people while attending the funeral of harry ames max is given this highly secret information by harrys white mistress as max reads the letter from harry explaining the plan his physical pain cancer of the rectum leaves him and is replaced with the pain of knowing too much and we share this pain as max reads panic in washington ensued when it was discovered that jaja not only had information on the alliance but on king alfred the contingency plan to detain and ultimately rid america of its negroes mere american membership in the alliance would have been sufficient to rock america but king alfred would have made negroes realize finally and angrily that all the new movesthe laws and committees to gain democracy for them were fraudulent just as minister q and the others have been saying for years your own letter to me days after you left the white house only underscored what so many negro leaders believed the one alternative left for negroes would be not only to seek that democracy withheld from them as quick and as violently as possible but to fight for their very survival king alfred as you will see leaves no choice have black people ever had a choice no yet the new york times reviewer said of the king alfred plan here believability falters the saturday review adds to white americas illusions with the assertion it reads rather like an antiwhite protocols of the elders of zion the nation said of the contingency it is an unlikely possibility that deflects attention from the ways power and prejudice actually work inevitable black genocide is a risky thing to base your whole vision upon a white critic reviewing a black book feels that the king alfred contingency plan is not only fiction but borders on science fiction were detroit and newark fiction were the deaths of three college students in south carolina two shot in the back fiction is the formation of one thousand vigilantes posse in chicago to fight off rioters fiction and what about the purchasing of armored cars mace an eyeirritating nauseous gas banana peel a chemical that makes a street too slippery to walk on polycarbonate riot shields grenade launchers for gauge shotguns and other weapons by city and state governments one can go further even after reading the socalled scholarly criticism in transaction and refer to the report from iron mountain the report not only legitimizes war but suggests that the government reconsider the reintroduction of slavery another possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction in some form consistent with modern technology and political processes of slavery as a black writer i can look at the man who cried i am from a different perspective and indeed see king alfred being implemented today no doubt about it mr williams can write he proved that with night song and sissie but the williams of this novel transcends the artist and becomes the seer the prophet one of the poor points of the book was the authors main characters consistent relationship with white women max and harry had white wives and max forever wanted a redhead when will we stop hating ourselves and start loving our own women as one black woman put it williams makes a fool of himself in this respect i guess he couldnt write any other way since he has one for a wife it is interesting to note that the black man will share his hard times with the black woman but when it comes to fame and fortune it looks better with a white woman at his side williams is ambiguous when he states that it was one thing to sleep with white women but quite another to marry them yet the two main figures in his novel had white wivesa part of being accepted i guess after seriously thinking about the ending for some time my conclusion is that it could happen mainly because we know for a fact that black fbi and cia agents do exist they are being used today in africa and in the black communities of the united states as for the minute transatlantic call max makes to minister q malcolm_x to tell about the king alfred contingency i regard it as extreme stupidity but then again what else would a negro do max as king negro had in actuality lost meaningful contact with his people he had left home a long time ago and had no intention of coming back if max had been in tune he would have had brothers in europe who would have helped him the value of this novel cannot be measured in terms of copies sold or reviews written to date it has not sold as well as confessions of nat turner for obvious reasons and most of the major white critics completely overlooked it this i believe is an indication of its importance ramparts magazine called it the toughest novel of the fall and ran an excerpt in its december issue this too indicates its value for this is the first time if i am not mistaken that a novel by an afroamerican has been excerpted in a major white publication yes john a williams has written a dangerous novel and when the order comes down from the regime that books with dangerous teachings should be publicly burnt the man who cried am will start the firedon l justed for price changes in dollars so they show the actual situation for all families during the sixties the data on family income are related to the number of persons within the family who are producing an income in more black than white families had two or three persons within the family bringing home paychecks but still a black family with three persons bringing home a salary median income of made less than a white family with just one earner between and median family income for blacks went up from to and from to for whites in statistical terms the median income for black families increased by percent while the increase for white families was percent consequently black families made percent as much as white families in and percent as much as white families in it would appear from these figures that black families were overtaking white families in their quest for a more equitable share of the nations resources but if you look at the statistics again and do a little calculating you will see that in a white family made more than a black family and in white families made more than black families the data show continued from page clearly then that in relative terms black families are overtaking whites but in absolute terms the situation is getting worse one of the most profound and perplexing problems which has plagued the black community for generations has been the conflict between males and females the income picture for persons as differentiated from families shows one underlying aspect of this conflict between and median income for black males years and older increased from to and for white males from to the percentage increase in the median income of the black male was percent as compared to a percent increase for the white male in a black man made percent as much as a white man and in he made percent as much in actual dollars the black man made less than a white man in and less in just as it was in family income the relative situation for the black man improved between and while the absolute situation declined of even greater interest to our understanding is that higher levels of education did not significantly improve the relative or absolute situation of the black man in a black man with eight years of school made percent as much as a white man with a similar education a black high school graduate made percent as much as a white man with a high school diploma and a black man who had some college made percent as much as a white man with some college in actual dollars this meant that in a black man with an elementary school education made less than a white a black with four years of high school made less and a black man with some college made less in a black man with elementary school education made percent as much as a white the high school graduate made percent as much and the black man who went to college made percent as much and in actual terms the income differences were and less respectively as we indicated earlier the picture is a confusing one but let us summarize the income situation of the black man in as compared to and black men as compared to white men in black men had a higher median income than in and this was true at all educational levels in the relative situation between black and white men had improved at all educational levels but the absolute situation had improved only for black men with eight years of education it had worsened for those with high school diplomas or who had attended college furthermore the relative situation had improved least and the absolute situation dedined worst for those who had college training this means that at the higher educational levels white men are moving so rapidly in america that black men at the same levels are barely keeping up the situation for black women for the same period of time and in the same age category is quite different median income for black women went up from in to in and for white women the change was to respectively in relative terms the income of black women increased by percent and that of white women by percent so that while black women made percent as much as whites in they made percent as much in in black women made less than whites and less in therefore in both relative and absolute terms the income situation for black women has improved since the nature of the relative and absolute improvement is seen more clearly when we analyze changes by educational levels in a black woman with eight years of school made percent as much as a white woman with similar education a black woman with a high school diploma made percent as much as a white woman and a black woman with some college made percent as much as a white woman with similar education by a black woman with eight years of school made percent as much as a white woman a black woman with a high school diploma also made percent as much and a black woman with some college made percent more than a white woman with similar education median income for a black woman with some college education in was more than the median income of the white woman with similar education although the data on income trends for blacks is confusing we believe several conclusions are justified in terms of family income the black population has made some relative improvements in the sixties but our absolute situation has remained virtually the same if we remember that it takes at least three earners in a black family to produce a median family income anywhere close to that of a white family with one earner we can certainly say there has been no improvement in the income situation of the black family we have to work three times harder and we still do not keep up with the majority of americans when we consider income of persons it is apparent as it has long been apparent that the black female is much more capable of matching and exceeding her white counterpart than is the black male furthermore while black females with higher levels of education exceed white females black males with higher levels of education fall further behind white males this economic picture aggravates so many of the subtle psychological problems facing the black family and the relations between black men and women earlier we pointed to two contradictory trends in the black population during the sixties the general social and economic picture of black families in the cities gives some foundation to the belief of some experts that black people may be moving in two directions recent special censuses in many of the major cities of the country are showing that since there has been relatively little improvement for many black families and in some cases a reversal in our situation in many cities the unemployment rates for blacks have been virtually the same throughout the sixties there has been no improvement in family income and often there is a rise in the proportion of families which are headed by women a notable example is the hough area of cleveland where the male unemployment rate was virtually unchanged from to and family income declined by percent the situation is not getting worse for all black people in major cities however and the trends bear very close observation and cautious interpretations there is no doubt that a larger black middleclass is coming into existence and there are some who would hold that these blacks are better off but we must ask better off in relation to what are they better off in relation to their previous situation in relation to lowincome blacks or in relation to whites in the same areas in which they live some limited data from cleveland provide us with some tentative answers to what may be happening to black people in various parts of the large cities of the nation while most of clevelands black population is generally found in nine neighborhoods some black people live outside of these areas in some percent of the black people in cleveland lived outside of the black community area and in percent of the black people lived outside of this area if we assume that in general those living away from the black community are middleincome people and those within the community lowincome blacks we can compare some of the characteristics of these two groups of blacks and then compare them to middleincome whites in cleveland the table lists some of the social and economic characteristics of these three groups in cleveland for and in middleincome black people had a fertility ratio the number of children under five for every women aged much lower than that of lowincome blacks indicating that poor blacks had more children to care for and less money with which to do so than their more prosperous brothers the proportion of children under living with both parents gives some indication of family stability and here the middleincome blacks were also better off for a higher percentage of their children live in stable families furthermore middleincome blacks had a full year more of completed school than did those in lowincome areas although middleincome blacks have an employment rate lower than that of lowincome blacks both groups have high levels of employment the difference between the two groups is most clearly seen in the income statistics middleincome blacks have a much lower proportion of families and the very low income category and a higher proportion in the category of those families making from eight to fifteen thousand dollars per year therefore the median income of the poor black families was only percent as much as the median income of the black families living outside of the black community we can confidently say that in cleveland in middleincome blacks were better off than lowincome blacks by the fertility ratio for all black families had declined considerably but the middleincome blacks still had much lower fertility than lowincome blacks the proportion of stable families in two communities went in opposite directions it got worse for the low income blacks and better for the middleincome blacks while both groups improved in their educational levels the middleincome blacks improved so much more rapidly that by they had over one and a half years more of completed education than did lowincome blacks the unemployment picture in was most interesting for the relationship of the males to each other did not change even though the general rates were lower for both groups the lowincome black women had a higher level of unemployment in while the unemployment rate for middleincome black women plummeted to below percent the effect of these diverging trends in female employment is seen in the income data in the lowest income category there has been virtually no change for lowincome blacks and a dramatic improvement for middleincome blacks while both groups saw improvements in the upper income categories there were twice as many middleincome black families making from eight to per year as there were lowincome blacks consequently the poor black families had a median income only percent as high as that of their more prosperous brothers a decline from the situation in the median income for middleincome black families was more than it was for lowincome black families and by it was more the evidence suggests that not only were middleincome black people in cleveland better off than lowincome black people in in the period since the middleincome blacks were moving further away from lowincome blacks in terms of family organization education employment and income the black population in one of americas major cities is moving in two different directions it appears given the comparative standing of middle and lowincome black families to each other in cleveland in and how do the middleincome black families compare to the white families who live in the same area as they do here we are unable to obtain all the data necessary for comparison like that above and the available data are not as satisfactory as we would wish for there were significant changes in the number of black and white families in the area under consideration while the number of black families living outside of the black community doubled in the five year period an increase of percent the number of white families declined by percent apparently as whites moved further away from middleincome black families in black families in middleincome areas of cleveland had a much higher level of fertility than white families and a much lower level of family stability black people were twice as likely as whites to be unemployed and consequently they had much lower income levels than whites over a fourth of the black families fell into the lowest income category as compared to a fifth of the white families and in the higher income categories the whites consistently outstripped the blacks some rather profound changes had taken place by the fertility level of the blacks was much closer to that of the whites as a consequence of a slight rise in white fertility and a large drop in black fertility black families were still characterized by more problems than white families however as only percent of all black youth under were living with both parents as compared to percent of the white youth the most significant change was in the unemployment levels black men were still twice as likely as white men to be without employment but black women had a much lower unemployment rate than white women finally there was a considerable equalization in the distribution of families by income levels it is true that more black than white families were in the lowest income category but the difference between the two groups was reduced greatly on the other hand the difference in the proportion of families in the highest income category was increased in favor of the whites while in the middlerange categories the black and white families were almost equitably distributed the general point we have been trying to articulate in this discussion of middle and lowincome black families in cleveland and their comparison to white families is in answer to the question if things have been getting better for some black people in the sixties what does getting better mean the data would suggest that middleincome black families are outdistancing lowincome black families in cleveland so in relation to each other the absolute and relative situation of middleincome blacks is getting better and that of lowincome blacks is getting worse however in a comparison of middleincome blacks to whites in the same area the data are suggestive if not conclusive in middleincome black families were in a rather unfavorable position as compared to white families by the situation had improved for two possible reasons many white families had moved out of the city in flight from the influx of black people and those whites who remain behind may fall into the lowest and highest income categories and black women carried a considerable portion of the incomeproducing activities of black families thus making it possible for their families to exist in some reasonable comparison to the white families who remained in the area the situation for black men as compared to white men had not improved at all it was the continuation of the feminine practice of supporting the family which has apparently made it possible for the black families in cleveland to improve their situation in relation to the white families in this paper we have tried to specify some of the major demographic trends in the black community in the sixties to underscore some of the issues that must be taken into account in the development of a black university the data indicate that black people are becoming a larger portion of the population in the nations largest cities and we have moved into a situation of influential control in at least one third of the largest cities other data which we have not discussed here indicate that the blacks moving into the larger cities tend to be young people who are better educated and more likely to engage in whitecollar occupations than the whites who remain in these cities furthermore the data indicate that in the sixties black people have been seeking education more than ever before however in occupations and in employment there has been no substantial improvement for the black population with the exception of some notable changes for black women while black people have shown improvement over previous periods in income in relation to whites in america the situation is not as favorable black men particularly those with higher levels of education are no more able now than they were previously to match white men in income on the other hand black women compare much more favorably with white women in producing incomes and at the higher educational levels black women clearly excel white women in income when we can separate middle and lowincome blacks we see that middleincome blacks are improving their social and economic situation much faster than lowincome blacks thus the two groups are getting further apart and there is evidence that middleincome black families have been able to make gains on middleincome white families but primarily because of the incomeproducing ability of black women a black university must address itself to the changes taking place in the black community and two profound conditions have been presented in this article we must carefully consider the consequences of the fact that in these times the burden of family support still falls heavily upon the shoulders of black women how this affects black men in particular and black families in general must be given very close attention as we attempt to respond to the conditions and needs of the black community secondly we must consider the significance of the split between middle and lowincome blacks that has clearly developed in the sixties it would seem safe to say that many prosperous blacks are being rewarded in this country while many poor blacks are taking to the streets there must be a philosophy and ideology which will unite the black community regardless of economic condition or social status if our prosperous brothers continue to prosper by putting their wives in the labor force and begin to forget it may well be that in the s one century after the emancipation decade of the s we may see the reinstatement of the old houseslave versus fieldslave dichotomy using income education and place of residence as the basis of differentiation lord have mercy black art by jon lockard on onye lockard is a selftaught artist a fact which might have something to do with his choice of subjects for as an artist mr lockard is not much concerned about the art class geometries and the delicacy of shadow on a rose his art is directed toward human beings and to delineating their beauty their anguish and their joys the impact of mr lockards work is evident on the next three pages but it is to be regretted that negro digest is unable to reproduce the three paintings in color for colorin more than one senseis most important in mr lockards work the faces and the hands are black very black but touched with that deep umber which suggests the earth and the backgrounds which appear merely dark in black and white are shades of blue red and flameorange in the original mr lockard a detroit native currently lives and works in ann arbor mich where his studio ann arbor art centre s fourth ave is located he formerly operated studio in detroit specializing in commercial art and illustrations and attended wayne state university as an art major he now concentrates on portraits color prints of the paintings reproduced here are available through mr lockards studio they are by inches in size and sell for each they also are available framed at additional cost framed x prints are available for s the unframed prints also are available at vaughns book store in detroit and at ellis book store in chicago that something is gravely wrong with the conventional approach to the education of black children no longer is arguable much of the problem of course is general there is something gravely wrong with american education period however as always in a society whichbeing racist by natureassigns opportunities and rewards according to race and color those people suffer most who are regarded least and those people in the american society are black people it is a hopeful sign that some of the brightest young people who have chosen education as their profession are deeply concerned about the deficiencies of existing educational institutions particularly as these institutions relate to black students and the communities from which the students come these educators are no longer willingas so many of their predecessors were to sit back comfortably and garner laurels and enjoy status while the talent and potential of the masses of black children are criminally wasted the idea of a black universityan institution designed to serve the real and total needs of the black communityhas taken root and there is every reason to believe that the idea will grow and eventually take concrete shape the special issue of negro digest devoted to a consideration of the concept of the black university developed through discussions with gerald mcworter a recent phd graduate of the university of chicago now an assistant professor of sociology at fisk university in nashville in his outline letter to the other contributors to this special issue of negro digest mr mcworter said that the articles dealing with facets of the proposed black university would concern themselves with a vision the articulation of an ought for the future he made it clear that the concept of the black university as envisioned by himself and the editors was concerned with the entire spectrum of social economic psychological and cultural imperatives which characterize influence and control the black community in a further clarification by the editors the black university concept was described as also being concerned with the art of black people and with the development and articulation of a black esthetic it is concerned with the conscious strengthening of those institutions which make the black community viable and it is dedicated to the liberation of black students and black people generally from the inhibiting and crippling presumptions which have been imposed upon black life and culture from outside the black community the projected special issue on the black university was conceived with five basic articles in mind plus two case studies of existing black educational institutions the proposed areas of concern for the five articles were as follows the black university toward a conceptual model policy and support trustees administrations and funding the academic process faculty students courses research the black university and its community social change in the sixties and the international perspective the third world that the articles as presented fall short of the goal set for the special issue of the magazine is testimony more to the inflexible demands of deadlines and the preciousness of time than to any failing on the part of the contributors all educators of the highest competency despite the inadequacy of time however they have presented here an urgent and imaginative educational prospect one which will surely engage black students and educators more deeply in the days to come for their efforts and for their service to the community negro digest is most grateful hoyt w fuller managing editor what is this thing called negritude for africa in particularand for much of the rest of the world in generalthe era of western discovery exploration and occupation constituted a long night of exploitation and domination and while colonialism scourged most of the nonwhite world only the black men from africa were massively enslaved corralled by the millions and transported in chains across the seas to alien lands torn from their roots forbidden access to their cultural sustenance assigned roles as eternal drones the black men from africa drawing from some uncommon racial reservoir nonetheless found the strength and the strategy to endure the long night is now receding before a new dawn but the coming light alone cannot heal the deep affliction induced by the prolonged darkness strong medicine is required to cure the disease of degrada tion and negritude has been offered as antidote to the ancient evil of antiblack racism it was a group of black intellectuals in paris who first advanced the idea of negritude cesaire aime a poet from the french antilles and leopold sedor senghor a poetstatesman from senegal chief among them senghor now president of the republic of senegal remains the principal proponent of negritude and he sums it up in these words negritude is the whole complex of civilized valuescultural economic social and politicalwhich characterize the black peoples or more precisely the negro african world in other words the sense of communion the gift of mythmaking the gift of rhythm a myth which evolves with its circumstances into a form of humanism united nations president alex quaisonsackey of ghana defines negritude as an acceptance and affirmation of the quality of blackness a psychological gathering together of all black peoples in the spiritual bonds of brotherhood and american professor st clair drake terms negritude a soft and resilient rather than a hard and mechanical approach to life a deep resentment over subordination to white people during the years of slave trade and the subsequent structuring of caste relations here and in africa i negritude then is also a form of racialismyes but in the words of french philosopher jeanpaul sartre antiracial racialism therein lies the difference and dr drake explains antiracist racialism was brought into view by its opposite which is aggressive exploitative racism and the whole concept of negritude assumes in its dialectic that antiracist racialism is destined to disappear the black revolution is international by rukudzo murapa of us have tended to equate slavr ery with the mass transportation of africans bqund in chains by heartless christian adventurers from their native homelands to far off sugar and cotton plantations in america to give slavery such a limited definition is to deny the historical facts of black experience on the african continent ever since the first christian slavehunting whiteman planted his foot on the west coast of africa if the system that brought the african to america was slave trade then the system that remained on the continent was slaveryonthespot they called it colonialism both systems as is well known were conducted and perpetuated by the same people both systems are filled with such incredible callousness that they sound like cruel fairy tales the two systems have a lot in commona thing most historians have left untold first they were both designed to benefit the west economically slave trade to america was not only a gigantic commercial operation involving well over million lives but was a great help in financing both the english and french industrial revolutions as well as making possible the rise of the american plantation system colonialism on the other hand involved far more millions of lives provided the necessary raw material for the english and french industrial revolutions and helped finance the economic needs of the imperial powers in addtion to the small wars they fought among themselves as well as both world wars second both systems effectively excluded the blackman from participating in the formation of the political institutions that would control him even today some southern states of america still refuse to extend the rights to vote to the blacks there just as the preponderant majority of the blacks in rhodesia south africa mozambique angola and socalled portuguese guinea are denied the right to vote third both systems were founded on the firm belief that the white race is endowed with superiority over the damned blacks this feeling of superiority led the white man to treat the blackman with a paternalistic attitude in both systems fourth both systems were marked with inhumane torture inflicted upon the blacks by the whites sir hans sloane in reported that the slaves who committed major crimes were punished by nailing them down on the ground with crooked sticks on every limb and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands burning them gradually up to the head for crimes of a lesser nature gelding or chopping off half of the foot with an axe fifth the banner of christianity was held high in both systems before setting out on his voyages to hunt for slaves john hawkins always repeated his prayer serve god daily love one another preserve your victuals as if this was not enough he christened one of his slave ships jesus on the other hand the colonist always reminded himself of his threepoint mission to christianize to civilize and to trade he even traded his christianity for the africans land a story is told of the white man who came to africa with a bible in his hand and found the african on his land upon meeting the african the whiteman asked the african to close his eyes and let us pray by the time they said amen alas the african found the bible in his hand and his land was gone humourous as this may sound this is in fact what seems to have happened the list of similarities between the slave trade and colonialism can hardly be exhausted for the purpose of this paper however those that have been enumerated above will suffice the question to be asked is what kind of blackman emerged under each of the two systems we have already seen what happened to the african who was taken to america as a slave where he was turned into a negro by being stripped of his cultural identity the negrofied african american blackman lost the key to human dignity with human dignity lost no pride in the self was left consequently he did not only lose faith in himself and his fellowman but actually became ashamed of himself and worst of all hated himself because he hated himself he wanted to be like somebody else and the only somebody else there was to imitate was his master the white man the various shades of skin colorfrom the socalled highyellow to the quite black started distinguishing them intelligence no longer held the key to better opportunities but the shade of ones skin the lighter the skin the better the opportunities the white community employing the old machiavellian trick of divide and rule encouraged this to be lightskinned was not a source of shame for the extralegal integrationunderthe bedsheet activities between the black mother and the white master to be light was to be good to be acceptable to have a little dignitymaybe a little culture the nearer white one looked the better he felt is it any wonder therefore that the negrofied african wanted to make his hair look like the white mans he applied chemicals on his hair and burned it into a process or conk others chose to shave off all their hair or get the closest haircut possiblethey call it collegiate when i first came to this country i believed that all american black women grew straight hair naturally this belief stayed with me for four years until one rainy day a friend cancelled our dinner date with the excuse that the rain had turned her hair back some women even chose to dye their hair blond i have heard them referred to as congolese blonds i call this search for identityphase such are the manifestations of the shame afroamericans have been made to feel about themselves the manifestation of a crime worse than murderpsychic genocide if this is what happened to the black man brought to america what kind of an african emerged under the colonial system while the slavetrade completely m cut off the slave from his land thus denying him his culture onthespotslavery or colonialism allowed the colonist to decide which land the african was to occupy and which belonged to him the colonist the land distribution laws which colonialism introduced in most countries demanded the removal of the african from the most fertile and productive areas to the least productive areas the land issue probably disturbed the africans way of life more than any other single issue besides the inequity in the land distribution itself there was a sharp philosophical conflict between the two groups as to the concept of land the western colonialist regarded land as a marketable commodity while the african regarded it as a godgiven right to be communally owned to the african land and life were inseparable land was the only visible and tangible basis for sustenance and subsistence thus losing land was tantamount to losing life itself yet like it or not the land is a marketable commodity philosophy had to prevailbut not without fierce armed resistance from the africans once the land was distributed the colonialists got the better and larger share in proportion to their numerical numbers in rhodesia for instance the whites who constitute seven percent of the population own more than percent of the land the africans over percent of the population are forced to live on about percent of the landthis being die least fertile and poorly drained land once the land was taken the colonialists embarked upon the next stagethat of superimposing the european western cultures education and christianity were the two main channels used in imposing western culture on the african the education system was a direct carbon copy of that found in europe needless to say such a system was designed to deal with problems and further the interests of the imperial powers in biology the african had to learn herbs in england france portugal etc which are hardly relevant to his immediate environment this was true of other subjects today one will notice that the socalled educated african knows more about the history of europe than his own he can recite the stories of william and mary charles i and ii raleigh the mayflower napoleon the seven years war joan of arc the crusades etc with such accuracy it appears as if he were there ask him about his own history about the kingdoms of ghana songhai mali congo or zimbabwe and he will look at you as if you were crazy and if he knows anything about african history it is usually history in the version of the white colonialist just as the slave in america was made to be ashamed of his own history so was the african made to look negatively at his own past if education made the african direct his mind to europe christianity made him give up his whole selfthat is his customs values and religious beliefs christianity probably inflicted more harm on african culture than education as it involved more people while in most cases one had to be a christian in order to get an education since most of the schools were run by missionaries one did not have to be educated in order to be a christian the christian missionaries did not have the ability to separate the christian religion from western culture if indeed that is possible in the eyes of the missionaries everything african was pagan demonic or heathen to the missionary the african drum was filled with evil spirits so were the people who danced to the tunes african ways of worship said the missionary were pagan since the missionary could not understand it to him the african was worshiping his ancestors not knowing that he was worshiping through his ancestors to a higher being just as the missionary worshiped to god through jesus or the mohammedans through muhammed to allah without taking time to study and understand the african culture the missionary felt his divine mission was to wipe out the african way of life with the same conviction and vigor his brethren had fought the crusade wars thus once the african was enjoined to the christian family through the baptism ritual in the name of the father son and the holy spirit he had to change his whole way of life like the slave in america he had to change his name to a western name for the westerner this was civilization the average african believed it with education and christianity combining their forces to make a new african the end result was the emergence of a britishafrican frenchafrican portugueseafrican etc yet somehow there still remained an africanafrican the westernized african did not sever his native cultural ties completely this is virtually impossible for anybody to do just as the american black man became disillusioned when he found that he wasnt completely accepted by the white community no matter how american he felt the educated andor christianized african soon realized that the white communityincluding many if not most missionariesdid not accept him as an equal this led him to demand complete control of his own life to do this he had to control all those institutionspolitical economic social and cultural that affected his life and the lives of his people the inherent contradictions within the systems once they manifested themselves became dysfunctional to the system the rise of nationalism and the demand for political independence was a direct result of the disillusionment once disillusioned the african sought to give himself a definition of his own similar to the identity sought by the american blackman this second identity for the american blackman is in actuality a denial or a rebuff of the first while the search for identity phase i caused the negrofied african to be ashamed of himself physically and spiritually search for identity phase leads him not only to accept what he is but to be proud of it it is a search for soul it is what i call the denegrofication of the black man in america it is a sincere attempt to search for and develop cultural identity with the old country more and more american black men refuse to be referred to as negroes instead they choose to be called either blacks or afroamericans in other words as human beings they are africans cognizant and conscious of our common cultural heritage among the peoples of african origin throughout the world and are desirous of reviving and extending a dynamic interest in this heritage the roots of souv by william melvin kelley ne assumption about the blackman in the united states that no one seems to question is that he was completely cut off from africa and so is totally a product of european civilization that he is a black european as recently as the summer of i still believed this and wrote the negro was so completely cut loose from africa that next to nothing is left of it in his culture he is more completely american than anyone in this country not because as some say he has been here so long but because the american culture is the only culture he knows this was so i believed because i had been taught as have we all that the only way for a civilization to preserve itself is in books in terms of a written language the european in europe and the united states is always using the phrase since the beginning of recorded time he assumes that no one knows anything about what happened before that beginning and that the only way man can find out about before the beginning is to dig up something somewhere once anyone black or white accepts that principle the rest follows like grease when the european went into africa he didnt find any written language so immediately he assumed that african civilization was a stupid a primitive a subhuman civilization later after darwins theory of evolution he amended the wording slightly now we represented a lower stage of development but he meant the same thing primitive stupid and subhuman and all because we didnt have written languages but to decide that a civilization is subhuman because it has no written language is as silly as saying that one man is more subhuman than another simply because he cant write his name by the same principle within the ranks of the literate human distinctions would correspond to the quality of a mans handwriting the man who cannot write lives life as talkerlistener he may be missing something but we cant say that his life his experience is less human less valid than that of a man who can write his name quite simply he lives a different kind of life his experience is different and since experience moulds personality and culture two sets of experiences will mould different men and cultures after the european discovered africa decided to conquer it and did militarily at least he realized that he had conquered a different kind of man but then something and the european will have to figure out why and what snapped and instead of saying i am different from you and starting from there he said we are the same but i am better that was the end for him we were the same but lower he convinced himself that he had experienced in his own cultural past the same things that we were experiencing in his present he assumed that he knew us so we learned nothing about us instead of searching for the terms in which we defined ourselves he defined us in terms of himself and what he had he had a written language we did not we were subhuman if the european had looked for what we did have he would have discovered that instead of written languages and written traditions we had very complex oral languages and oral traditions for example the sentence a woman sitting on a bed sewing is crying in the ibo language of west africa becomes nwanyi no nenu akwa nakwa akwa nakwa akwa the ibo language is a tone language to make this clear suppose there are seven tones in speaking which correspond to seven notes in the key of c c through b if you sang nakwa to the notes eb it might mean sitting if you sang it to the notes fd it might mean crying add to this the possibilities o mood accents context rhythm and we have what the european calls a primitive language no wonder we didnt write them down it would take more than letters placed side by side to get the ibo language on paper in fact african writers trying to write in their own language are having just this problem they are working with tonic alphabets our oral tradition was as complex and sophisticated as our languages when the european was tucked away silently reading books which a person can only do alone africans were out in the world among all kinds of people talking to them learning from them arguing with them doing business with them talking women were passing cultural traditions in the stories they told their children men who healed the sick were instructing younger men artists were being trained in their cultures artistic principles knowledge of the past of the environment was being passed around not just within a lifetime but from one lifetime to the next spanning centuries and oceans on the boats which brought us to the united states we talked do you doubt it we did not waste time worrying about not possessing a written culture for the european not to bring we talked about where each of us had come from the beliefs and myths of that place the places each of us had been what he had done there we talked about our present situation and our probable future we did not sit in our chains silently we whispered do you doubt it an ibo and an ashanti chained together found a way to talk we created languages suited to our primary need survival gullah is an example of such a language in the united states bubba meaning brother is a gullah word cooler means turtle goober means peanut our oral tradition remained alive and with it africa in the united states it was not the africa of whofoughtwhoforwhat strange that the history of europe and the united states is the history of wars or exactly where we had come from or the exact languages we had spoken not history culture civilization as the european defines them it was instead the africa say of the kitchen an african woman may have cooked unseasoned meat and bland potatoes for her master but when she got some scraps from his table and took them back to her cabin she cooked the food she wanted to eat african with spice and pepper and she taught her daughter african cooking using what they had and her daughter taught her daughter and that daughter cooks african food in a little diner in the middle of harlem today i have eaten proof of what i say in many an african students hotel room tender pepperhot meat onions greens and the rice the rice or dont take the cooking take the christianity of the blackman in the united states the european thinks that we believe in his religion he thinks that we believe in his god and his gods son but the evidence shows that we believe in our god our god likes some good music in his church he likes some people to go into trance and talk tongues different people different gods and if our concept of god is different from the europeans the difference must originate in africa where else and our music wherever africans survived in what the european likes to call the new world despite the redman having been on the continent for at least years we find our music in jamaica it is called calypso in cuba guaguanco in brazil samba in the united states jazz terrible word and when we in the united states hear calypso guaguanco or samba dont we know it is our music we dance to all of it our music is perhaps the best example of how the oral tradition preserved africa in the united states any black musician ive ever met or heard about has emphasized personal contact oral contact musical contact with another musician as an important aspect of his musical development clifford brown played with max roach who played with dizzy who played with roy eldridge louis armstrong played with king oliver who played with buddy bolden who played with a blackman who played with a blackman who played with a musician who before his abrupt arrival in the united states had played on some trumpetlike instrument in ashantiland the european in the united states tells us that our music is american have we ever believed that has any european been an innovator or practitioner of our music on an equal level with james brown duke ellington thelonious monk coleman hawkins lester young charlie parker leadbelly or sonny rollins and others this is not because of any inherent weakness in the european in the united sates he is simply not in the african oral mainstream he does not get the right information it did not have to be that way elsewhere in the hemisphere we can see that african and european have mixed culturally racially that africa has spread to a great many people but in those other places the nature of the oppression was different from that which we faced because the europeans practicing it were different than our european historians have shown the difference between catholic and protestant slavery or french and spanish slavery or both of these and english slavery what our european did was to segregate us from himself and at the same time lump us together he really should have kept our tribes apart chained ibo to ibo promoted tribal animosity within the united states as he does today in africa encouraged each tribe to compete for his favor but instead seeing us all as subhuman as inferior he did not bother to distinguish between us and so lumped us together giving us at least one common experience and enemy then he pushed us away he erected a social institution which would save him from contamination so doing he robbed himself of african civilization not to say that he didnt steal parts of it without really understanding it james brown is not elvis presley the five stair steps are not the beatles and he created a situation in which he would not contaminate us now we begin to see our true situation in the united states because african civilization was an oral rather than a written civilization each adult african who arrived in the united states possessed an enormous body of knowledge about himself his history traditions and customs knowledge which could not be destroyed as long as he lived and talked each african sifted through his experience his knowledge trying to find something to help him survive in his new environment and he was talking he asked other africans other slaves sons of africans picking up different kinds of knowledge sharing experience finally the tribes the cultures the newcomers and oldtimers mixed and what has emerged is not a culture with nothing of africa in it but rather a panafrican culture but the europeans did not see this he saw instead a universe with himself at the center a few steps down the ladder from his god he had a written language he had machines he owned things like guns people and books which told him that his culture his civilization was the greatest most advanced that the world had ever known until the th century his maps told him that the world was flat his philosophers told him that if a man made money it was evidence that god had blessed him with a soul that was predestined to go to heaven we couldnt read or writebut we knew where china was chinese plates have been found in the congo dating from before marco polo a boatload of chinese arrived on the shores of what is now kenya ages before the european moslems in the camerouns and nigeria knew where mecca was egypt knew where israel was ghanaians may have known the incas and where california now is some africans knew where rome was their pictures are in the mosaic tile bathrooms at pompeii but the european looked at us and saw cheap labor cotton tobacco money heaven a black cain killing a white abel and being driven from the garden of eden or later as a lower level on the evolutionary scale fish amphibian reptile mammal ape nigger man european civilization we did not possess a written language because we hadnt evolved to it yet we had no books and couldnt remember anything but even in the united states away from that place the european was certain we had forgotten and locked away from his library a group of africans finished working played some drums told innocent stories about weak rabbits big dumb bears crafty foxes sang songs danced talked and everywhere the european sees evidence of africa in the united states youre damn right hes scared brother the eloquent legacy of a doomed african freedom fighter by toivo herman ja toivo lord we find ourj h selves here in a foreign ml country convicted ungj der laws made by people whom we have always considered as foreigners we find ourselves tried by a judge who is not our countryman and who has not shared our background aer iaws maae y peo when this case started counsel tried to show that this court had no jurisdiction to try us what they had to say was of a technical and legal nature the reasons may mean little to some of us but it is the deep feeling of all of us that we should not be tried here in pretoria you my lord decided that you had the right to try us because your parliament gave you that right that ruling has not and could not have changed our feelings we are namibians and not south africans we do not now and will not in the future recognize your right to govern us to make laws for us in which we had no say to treat our country as if it were your property and us as if you were our masters we have always regarded south africa as an intruder in our country this is how we have always felt and this is how we feel now and it is on this basis that we have faced this trial i speak of we because i am trying to speak not only for myself but for others as well and especially for those of my fellow accused who have not had the benefit of any education i think also that when i say we the overwhelming majority of nonwhite people in south west africa would like to be included we are far away from our homes not a single member of our families has come to visit us never mind be present at our trial the pretoria jail the police headquarters at compol where we were interrogated and where statements were extracted from us and this court is all we have seen of pretoria we have been cut off from our people and the world we all wondered whether the headmen would have repeated some of their lies if our people had been present in court to hear them the south african government has again shown its strength by detaining us for as long as it pleased keeping some of us in solitary confinement for to days and bringing us to its capital to try us it has shown its strength by passing an act especially for us and having it made retrospective ihas even chosen an ugly name to call us by ones own are called patriots or at least rebels your opponents are called terrorists a court can only do justice in political cases if it understands the position of those that it has in front of it the state has not only wanted to convict us but also to justify the policy of the south african government we will not even try to present the other side of the picture because we know that a court has not suffered in the same way as we have can not understand us this is perhaps why it is said that one should be tried by ones equals we have felt from the very time of our arrest that we were not being i tried by our equals but by our masters and that those who have brought us to trial very often do not even do us the courtesy of calling us by our surnames had we been tried by our equals it would not have been necessary to have any discussion about grievances they would have been known to those set to judge us it suits the government of south africa to say that it is ruling south west africa with the consent of the people this is not true our organization south west african peoples organization swapo is the largest political organization in south west africa we consider ourselves a political party we know that whites do not think of blacks as politiciansonly as agitators many of our people through no fault qf their own have had no education at all this does not mean that they do not know what they want a man does not have to be formally educated to know that he wants to live with his family where he wants to live and not where an official chooses to tell him to live to move about freely and not require a pass to earn a decent wage to be free to work for the person of his choice for as long as he wants and finally to be ruled by the people that he wants to be ruled by and not those who rule him because they have more guns than he has our grievances are called socalled grievances we do not believe south africa is in south west africa in order to provide facilities and work for nonwhites it is there for its own selfish reasons for the first years it did practically nothing to fulfill its sacred trust it only concerned itself with the welfare of the whites since because of the pressure from inside by the nonwhites and especially my organization and because of the limelight placed on our country by the world south africa has been trying to do a bit more it rushed the bantustan report so that it would at least have something to say at the world court only one who is not white and has suffered the way we have can say whether our grievances are real or socalled those of us who have some education together with our uneducated brethren have always struggled to get freedom the idea of our freedom is not liked by south africa it has tried in this court to prove through the mouths of a couple of its paid chiefs and a paid official that swapo does not represent the people of south west africa if the government of south africa were sure that swapo did not represent the innermost feelings of the people in south west africa it would not have taken the trouble to make it impossible for swapo to advocate its peaceful policy south african officials want to believe that swapo is an irresponsible organization and that it is an organization that resorts to the level of telling people not to get vaccinated as much as white south africans may want to believe this this is not swapo we sometimes feel that is what the government would like swapo to be it may be true that some member or even members of swapo somewhere refused to do this the reason for such refusal is that some people in our part of the world have lost confidence in the governors of our country and they are not prepared to accept even the good that they are trying to do your government my lord undertook a very special responsibility when it was awarded the mandate over us after the first world war it assumed a sacred trust to guide us toward independence and to prepare us to take our place among the nations of the world we believe that south africa has abused that trust because of its belief in racial supremacy that white people have been chosen by god to rule the world and apartheid we believe that for years south africa has failed to promote the development of our people where are our trained men the wealth of our country has been used to train your people for leadership and the sacred duty of preparing the indigenous people to take their place among the nations of the world has been ignored i know of no case in the last years of a parent who did not want his child to go to school if the facilities were available but even if as it was said a small percentage of parents wanted their children to look after cattle i am sure that south africa was strong enough to impose its will on this as it has done in so many other respects to us it has always seemed that our rulers wanted to keep us backward for their benefit nineteen sixtythree for us was to be the year of our freedom from it looked as if south africa could not oppose the world forever the world is important to us in the same way as all laughed in court when they heard that an old man tried to bring down a helicopter with a bow and arrow we laughed when south africa said that it would oppose the world we knew that the world was divided but as time went on it at least agreed that south africa had no right to rule us i do not claim that it is easy for men of different races to live at peace with one another i myself had no experience of this in my youth and at first it surprised me that men of different races could live together in peace but now i know it to be true and to be something for which we must strive the south african government creates hostility by separating people and emphasizing their differences we believe that by living together people will learn to lose their fear of each other we also believe that this fear which some of the whites have of africans is based on their desire to be superior and privileged and that when whites see themselves as part of south west africa sharing with us all its hopes and troubles then that fear will disappear separation is said to be a natural process but why then is it imposed by force and why then is it that whites have the superiority headmen are used to oppress us this is not the first time that foreigners have tried to rule indirectlywe know that only those who are prepared to do what their masters tell them become headmen most of those who had some feeling for their people and who wanted independence have been intimidated into accepting the policy from above their guns and sticks are used to make people say they support them i have come to know that our people cannot expect progress as a gift from anyone be it the united nations or south africa progress is something we shall have to struggle and work for and i believe that the only way in which we shall be able and fit to secure that progress is to learn from our own experience and mistakes your lordship emphasized in your judgment the fact that our arms come from communist countries and also that words commonly used by communists were to be found in our documents but my lord in the documents produced by the state there is another type of language it appears even more often than the former many documents finish up with an appeal to the almighty to guide us in our struggle for freedom it is the wish of the south african government that we should be discredited in the western world this is why it calls our struggle a communist plot but this will not be believed by the world the world knows that we are not interested in ideologies we feel that the world as a whole has a special responsibility towards us this is because the land of our fathers was handed over to south africa by a world body it is a divided world but it is a matter of hope for us that it at least agrees about one thingthat we are entitled to freedom and justice other mandated territories have received their freedom the judgment of the world court was a bitter disappointment to us we felt betrayed and we believed that south africa would never fulfill its trust some felt that we would secure our freedom only by fighting for it we knew that the power of south africa is overwhelming but we also knew that our cause is a just one and our situation intolerablewhy should we not also receive our freedom we are sure that the worlds efforts to help us in our plight will continue whatever south africans may call us we do not expect that independence will end our troubles but we do believe that our people are entitledas are all peoplesto rule themselves it is not really a question of whether south africa treats us well or badly but that south west africa is our country and we wish to be our own masters there are some who will say that they are sympathetic with our cause but unwilling to condone violence i would answer that i am not by nature a man of violence and i believe that violence is a sin against god and my fellow man swapo itself was a nonviolent organization but the south african government is not truly interested in whether opposition is violent or nonviolent it does not wish to hear any opposition to apartheid since swapo meetings have been banned it is true that it is the tribal authorities who have done so but they worked with the south african government which has never lifted a finger in favor of political freedom we have found ourselves voteless in our own country and deprived of the right to meet and state our own political opinions is it surprising that in such times my countrymen have taken up arms violence is truly fearsome but who would not defend his property and himself against a robber and we believe that south africa has robbed us of our country i have spent my life working in swapo which is an ordinary political party like any other suddenly we in swapo found that a war situation had arisen and that our colleagues and south africa were facing each other in the field of battle although i had not been responsible for organizing my people militarily and although i believed we were unwise to fight the might of south africa while we were so weak i could not refuse to help them when the time came my lord you found it necessary to brand me a coward during the second world war when it became evident that both my country and your country were threatened by the dark clouds of nazism i risked my life for both of them wearing a uniform with orange bands on it but some of your countrymen when called to battle to defend civilization resorted to sabotage against their own fatherland i volunteered to face german bullets and as a guard of military installations both in south west africa and the republic was prepared to be the victim of their sabotage today they are our masters and are considered the heroes and i am called the coward when i consider my country i am proud that my countrymen have taken up arms for their people and i believe that anyone who calls himself a man would not despise them in the african national congress anc and pan africanist congress pac in south africa were suppressed this convinced me that we were too weak to face south africas force by waging battle when some of my countrys soldiers came back i foresaw the trouble there would be for swapo my people and me personally i tried to do what i could to prevent my people from going into the bush in my attempts i became unpopular with some of my people but this too i was prepared to face decisions of this kind are not easy to make my loyalty is to my country my organization could not work properly it could not even hold meetings i had no answer to the question where has your nonviolence got us whilst the world court judgment was pending i at least had that to fall back on when we failed after years of waiting i had no answer to give to my people even though i did not agree that people should go into the bush i could not refuse to help them when i knew that they were hungry i even passed on the request for dynamite it was not an easy decision another man might have been able to say i will have nothing to do with that sort of thing i was not and i could not remain a spectator in the struggle of my people for their freedom i am a loyal namibian and i could not betray my people to their enemies i admit that i decided to assist those who had taken up arms i know that the struggle will be long and bitter i also know that my people will wage that struggle whatever the cost only when we are granted our independence will the struggle stop only when our human dignity is restored to us as equals of the whites will there be peace between us we believe that south africa has a choiceeither to live at peace with us or to subdue us for force if you choose to crush us and impose your will on us then you not only betray your trust but you will live in security for only so long as your power is greater than ours no south african will live at peace in south west africa for each will know his security is based on force and that without force he will face rejection by the people of south west africa my coaccused and i have suffered we are not looking forward to our imprisonment we do not however feel that our efforts and sacrifice have been wasted we believe that human suffering has its effect even on those who impose it we hope that what has happened will persuade the whites of south africa that we and the world may be right and they may be wrong only when white south africans realize this and act on it will it be possible for us to stop our struggle for freedom and justice in the land of our birth editors note the statement on the previous pages was taken from the congressional record where it was published at the behest of representative barrett ohara of illinois the following paragraphs prefaced mr toivos statement in the record representative barrett ohara of illinois asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the congressional record and to include extraneous matter mr ohara of illinois mr speaker we who are so fortunate as to live in a land where our legal rights and civil liberties are protected and cherished sometimes need reminding of our blessings we who enjoy freedom of speech and representative government may forget that there are people elsewhere in the world less fortunate often they are forced to suffer in silence but occasionally the veil is lifted a trifle and a voice is heard crying out for help for the afflicted this happened recently in pretoria where southwest africans have been charged by south africa under an act so unjust that it offends accepted civilized legal principles and grossly violates the universal declaration of human rights one of the defendants mr toivo herman ja toivo after being pronounced guilty addressed the court in mitigation of sentence he made such an eloquent statement that i am placing it in the record it captures the essence of his plight a plight which this government has repeatedly protested his is the plea of a people struggling to be free unfortunately his plea so far has had little effect on the south african government on february the judge sentenced mr toiva to years in jail and others to life imprisonment we can only hope that the censure of world opinion might yet persuade the government of south africa in the direction of clemency toward our freedom by keorapetse kgositsile must be deniggerfied demystified images to shape us black as men values but we must clearly understand that the questions of identity and nationalism are even at their utmost best a means not an end a good beginning in order for racial dominajwj j m tion to be successful the racist oppressor had to create in us selfdoubt and feelings of insecurity finally selfdespise when we understand this contradiction we will be better able to understand why the liberation struggle in africa mobilizes the people by awakening nationalist passions and why afroamericans rally around identity in colonial africa the peoples identity has remained relatively intact because the oppressor never pretended to assimilate us he attempted to crush our pride as african nationals he made us feel inadequate and weak as africans so it is as africans with a rediscovered pride after rejecting the distorted image of ourselves which colonial institutions had programmed us into that we begin our fight for liberation in america however particularly in the north the peoples identity is continually being damaged by the oppressors use of hypocritical rhetoric and bogus legislationbales of rosetinted cotton over the eyes of gullible subjects the vocabulary of the black mans experience in america is contaminated with terms like integration meltingpot society civil_rights which are nothing but ways of destroying the black victims identity to ensure his psychological captivity and his alienation from himself thus it is that the question of identity among afroamericans is of primary importance as a first step towards liberatory struggle identity and nationalism then are simply strategic points of reference in our struggle for liberation the world is on fire and we do not want to be scorched with the evil maniacs who throw napalm bombs on innocent children and unless values move us we deserve worse than death how does a thing mean if it doesnt move i know numerous south africans believe me who run around the world searching for a good white man in a desperate attempt to stop themselves from coming to grips with the only rational conditions under which we have to get our land back invariably though this captive searches between white thighs and finds the dollar or whatever currency extremely irresisti ble to say i have had enough of this be the this the most hideous kind of oppression and not do anything about itand not movedoes not amount to anv w thing we must move to create in concrete ways images of a livable world centuries of colonial domination moved and with them the oppressors chains from our wrists and ankles to our minds and soul raped but the slime remains invisible to the victims eye let us be sensitive to what is around us what we are into the selfavowed nationalist in black communities in the northern sectors of the united states reacting to the white oppressor calls me an african brother if african brother was strictly descriptive of place of birth there would be nothing to be worried about but there is this attitude behind african brother i am a brother however i am still a foreigner an outsider again a subconscious acceptance of the psychological boundaries created by the oppressor but in a black community in the south say in alabama i am not any more of a foreigner than my brother from harlem after the initial excitement over my being african i am simply another black man from another community and the alabama brother or sister might never have heard of nationalism or revolution divide and rulelets get to it the african on the other hand in most cases he is a student here comes on like some missionary afraid of the savagery of the natives often paternalistic and contemptuous in his dealings with afroamericans he is afraid to go up to harlem because these negroes are so rough and negroes are ashamed of us anyway they say we come from the jungle and i even know of an african statesman who told students from his country that if they married in america please do not take a nigger home if anything better look for a nice white girl raped but the slime remains invisible to the victims eye the white oppressor tells us that we do not like each other that we do not have anything in common and we accept the nonsense and affirm it without even realizing that we have been put in a trick because we do not look beyond the superficial appearance i concede that the relations between the african and other people of african descent are not what they could and should be we must not pretend that this does not exist because that way we could not possibly cure the sickness we must see the trick bag and understand why the oppressor found it necessary to put us in it then together we must let it go up in flames scorching to death the veiled oppressor hand twisting us around like puppets we have to start with a total rejection of the oppressor and his ways there is a tendency among us when we become disillusioned with the oppressors rhetoric the whiteman is not man enough to fulfill his promises we eventually realize to reject the oppressor and replace our former naive faith in his word with unguided hatred this rejection however has often turned out to be the most complete kind of acceptance of the oppressor because this disillusioned man often ends up assuming the role of the oppressor twisted and lacking in commitment to the people he does not even realize that his overt hatred is finally a manifestation of his envy for the oppressors bloodstained acquisitions there is the angry black artist who devotes his efforts to telling white people how immoral and inhuman they are because they do not love him and he has contempt for his people because they are ignorant and poorbut he does nothing to enlighten them there is the ambitious businessman who is against white businesses in black communities but as a superprofit motivated businessman he exploits his people as readily and as much as his white rival would and does there is the civil servant of the newly independent nation who is fascinated i believe by the glamour of his new position which used to be exclusively for the oppressor his concept of social change goes no farther than that there are black faces in the cabinet instead of white ones everything else remains as it was during the colonial period and the chains wax tighter around the mind heralding a coup a nephew of a prominent african political figure invited lindsay barrett the writer and i to dinner one day he would clap his hands for service and an elderly man old enough to be his grandfather whom he couldnt summon enough courage to look in the face would come in from the kitchen to see what master wanted this threatened my appetite and i asked our host to stop his performance there are probably a lot of things you do not like about the situation in our country he said as we got ready to leave but please dont write anything bad about it if you will still be writing in another ten years there will be some changes and you will have plenty of good things to write about i just shook my head in frustrated condemnation of the mentality of our bourgeoisie yesterdays victim turns villain today with comfort at our expense by this simply to point out that exploitation by a black capitalist elite is not less hideous than exploitation by a white racist oppressor after the bloodshed after the coups and countercoups inevitably builtin in almost every struggle against the oppressor after the oppressor is forced to hand over the government to the fighting colonial subject after the national independence celebrations and even babies learn to speak by singing the new national anthem we shall still be quite a long way from freedom because freedom is not an experience nor is freedom the physical absence of the white oppressor freedom is an attitude a complex of emotional and psychological responsesconscious and subconscioustowards life shaped and determined by the values a people lives by in harmony with other peoples and nature freedom and with it liberation is socialistic in nature socialistic because the purposeaim is the greatest good for the greatest number not as unattainable ideal but as an actual mode of living panafricanism or african unity seems today in to be more removed from our reach than it was in why i suggest that our lack of a clear understanding of our contradictions led to this we relied upon the influence of external forces for our unity black people suffered under white oppression and it was on opposition to white oppression that we based our unity after political independence and the oppressor was no longer thereby this to mean no more than white faces in administrative and civil service jobs were replaced by black onesapparently we were left without a great need for unity our unity should be something we desire something we fashion regardless of the presence or absence of the oppressor our unity should be based upon positive attitudes towards our future something to be proud of our unity should be a positive act by us and for us instead of a mere protest or reaction against white domination its common factor more noble than oppression to speak of a movement towards freedom and unity without a clear understanding of our goals could not possibly change our condition significantly and the africanity of the oau organization of african unity is still very questionableask brother julius nyerere selfreliance selfdetermination destination and road woven inseparably every inch of the way and when we fail and fall into the claws of neocolonialism the fault is with us the road to liberation starts with resolving our national contradictions mwalimu nyerere is a committed teacher we have a great deal to learn from him he teaches us that our basic requirements are hard work and intelligence he teaches us that we cannot depend upon gifts loans and investments from foreign countries and foreign companies because there is no way of doing that without endangering our independence let us therefore always remember the following he says in the arusha declaration we have made a mistake to choose money something which we do not have to be our major instrument of development we are mistaken when we imagine that we shall get money from foreign countries firstly because to say the truth we cannot get enough money for our development and secondly because even if we could get it such complete dependence on outside help would have endangered our independence and the other policies of our country the development of a country is brought about by people not by money money and the wealth it represents is the result and not the basis of development in order to maintain our independence and our peoples freedom we ought to be selfreliant in every possible way and avoid depending upon other countries for assistance if every individual is selfreliant the house cell will be selfreliant if all the cells are selfreliant the whole ward will be selfreliant and if the wards are selfreliant the district will be selfreliant if the districts are selfreliant then the region is selfreliant and if the regions are selfreliant then the whole nation is self reliant and this is our aim demystified indeed in deed then we must build and be productive for our salvation we rhave to build attitudes we have to build men and women fearless souls we have to build model famm ilies to build model communities to produce societies with values fashioning a life worth living we have to build our own economies inde pendent of whatever hideous devil is threatened by our attitudes and ways there will be some movement then and we will be rebuilding every individual man in our communities wherever he is never insensitive to his roots replenishing our collective energy and resources our lives then rhythm of a purposeful direction all things falling into place natural and desirable freedom is an attitude our values clearly patterning our actions and reactions the most valid song of our life unity and selfreliance the national anthem sung by the way we live wherever we live knowing no rest until our life flows like a poem loving the lovable we must create more of it destroying the detestable knowing what we be by mari evans here is the possibility t that you are living more precariously than you know consider largely unreported by most newspaper accounts of miss eartha kitts controversial white house encounter was her alleged avowal that she spoke not as a negro but as an american you see during a writers conference a black student in a black sociology class at a black college wailed passionately i think of myself as a citizen of one worldnot a negro an yearold high school dropout stood with me in the pathetically bare confines of a recreation room in the heart of a ghetto the tiny area empty except for a battered piano and some equally battered wooden folding chairs had been provided by a poverty action program in weak hope that it would serve to subvert adolescent leanings toward violence he was a reluctant and somewhat suspiciousminded conversationalist riot not him he wasnt liable to get hisself shot at or his head beat in okay now tell me this if you needed socks where would you buy them the project shopping center housed variety storesone blackowned one whiteowned at the first one i got to probably the white one why oohhhhi dont have no prejudice there are more gems the wounded black serviceman on day leave from vietnam who castigated me when i mentioned having participated in peace demonstrations he lectured on the dangers of communism and i incredulous could not get in a word about the various virulent forms of american fascism wallaceism reaganism welchism et al there was the black civic leader whitesubsidized and nationally acclaimed for her block clubs and nobeerdrinkinginpublic policies who said on a local tvcast if you can teach them and you know who them is to be good citizens all else will follow chuckling dont if there are million of us i lay you odds give or take a few hundred thousand that million of us stand with proudly palpitating hearts and add our rich natural rhythms to the star spangled banner proudly proclaiming for whiteys approval i am an american first and a negro second this is in the category of the jews classic we are germans first and jews later many of those good white lawabiding german citizens were still singing this refrain halfway to belsen and dachau and they learned the answer to the ancient riddle paraphrased of which came firstgerman citizenship or jewishnessin the shower rooms of auschwitz and treblinka you are a black person first baby and youd better remember it consider the unique position of the jews in prenazi europe families such as the rothschilds weinmanns the petscheks controlled vast properties and were deeply involved in international finance jews owned steel corporations coal mines textile mills they had extensive real estate holdings they owned banks chemical firms and big business establishments as well as a plethora of small enterprises in fact years ago jewish money formed if not the backbone of the economic structure of europe a significant portion of its strength if that were not enough the jews had a racial bank of academic scientific technical and professional skills which may have surpassed any accumulation we as a race presently possess in poland they were the intelligentsia who even in the squalid ghettos to which they were driven maintained a cultural existence just prior to the nazi occupation there were jewish daily newspapers jewish weeklies and a total of jewish periodicals in poland alone and one survivors account of the vilna poland ghetto mentions the activities of a symphony two choirs and a literary group which held a series of literary evenings and organized literary competitions they were an incredible people these jews their contributions to their society cannot be argued add then the factor which should have insured their assimilation and more or less assured their acceptance as firstclass citizens in a white majority culture they were whiteskinned many millions of them could and on the face of it did disappear within the structure of german societyleaving only a ripple to mark the spot where they m discarded their jewishness for the greater glory of assimilation the people who appreciated this allegiance least according to the mountains of documents and photographs which recorded years of systematic jewish extermination were the good german citizens themselves one chronicler of the nazi holocaust said aside from the indispensable fact of its minority status long in the land deeply in and of its culture a familiar of its political and scientific thoroughfares yet racially distinct the jew was a german and he was not of the exact proportion of identity and difference he provided the perfect object for a transference of guilt it is tragic and ironic that the very effort of the jew to be assimilated into the german genus betrayed him most completely into the hands of his enemies even in early childhood mimicry is recognized as a stimulus for rage it is argued that in mimicry one may perceive ones own flaws in another and strike out against them with no pain to the ego with our high degree of black visibility we wisely substitute the word integration for the word assimilation but we mean the same thing the jews meant yes these were incredible people the jews incredibly wealthy incredibly knowledgeable incredibly blind for if their destruction as individuals can be attributed to any single factor it must surely be this their refusal to think and act as a racial group safe in their citizenship and motivated by their need to be accepted and assimilated by the germans they tried not to think of themselves as jews preferring instead to be known as good germansuntil the dominant german society legislated away this dubious privilege in shortthey were voted out of the club baby you say it cant happen here do you know how many black men we have in congress fiveof a total of you dont make the laws baby you are governed by them your secure status as an american citizen can be affected at the drop of an executive order as was the case in february when occasioned by necessity the word can be equated with public hysteria president roosevelt signed executive order no which set the stage for the internment of thousands of yellowskinned americans after pearl harbor american indignation focused with mounting fury on its yellowskinned citizens despite their complete lack of responsibility for and involvement with the attack as a matter of fact most of the japanese finally imprisoned in camps for their own safety and for the public good maintained their loyalty and allegiance to their country throughout their imprisonmentgoing to such unbelievable extremes as to accept menial employment under guard outside the camps to hold bond drives within the camps and to volunteer for service in the armed forces ironically the famed nisei th infantry battalion a segregated unit composed primarily of japaneseamericancitizens was the most decorated american outfit in world war ii the fear which consumed white americans at the time was fear that other american citizens persons they thought of as yellowskinned first and citizens second would violently take over the government they were in short afraid of yellow power and this is the mood of the country at the moment possibly the position of the blackskinned american citizenwho contrary to the placid lawabiding japanese has said hell no we wont go to viet nam and who has burned thfc white mans cities looted his stores and demonstrated a frightening ability to proceed with a degree of singlemindedness toward an objective to follow the japanese without any previously established guilt on their part and as a preventive measure and in the interest of national security these citizens were summarily relocated in remote and arid wastelands hundreds of miles from their neat gardens their ranchstyle homes their red trs that they might comply with public law passed in by the congress of the united states to support the presidents executive order japanese businesses were closed farms placed in governmental custody belongings sold stored or destroyed homes locked and they with what possessions they could hurriedly throw in barracks bags and suitcases were bussed to their new homes an armed caucasian soldier sat in the front of each bus america is a christian country when discussing the imprisonment and immobilization of of its slanteyed yellowskinned citizens it utilized a word with christian overtones evacuation evacuation implies a necessary but christian and merciful actwhen in actual fact to the doctors lawyers cooks gardeners housewives scientists students children who were evacuated from a correspondingly wide range of socioeconomic conditions to hastilv constructed wooden barracks and hastily petitioned and whitewashed horse barns still odorous it was a nightmare all the more horrible for its reality the semantics of prisoners versus evacuees need not be argued hitler was more direct early in he avowed we shall have to develop a technique of depopulation i mean the removal of entire racial units one writer states the devious practice of arresting jews ostensibly for their own safety began about that time the relocation of nisei was not americas first experiment in depopulation nor is germany the only western country that has placidly watched the extermination of a race ask the american indiancitizen emeritus you who are flagwaving americans first and negroes only because you cant close your eyes every time you look in the mirror remember the jews and the nisei and if vou can handle it the indians the american indian cant happen to you i wouldnt say that you may not take wallace reagan and welch seriously babv but there are a whole lot of j good white american citizens who do and thev vote how could it come about easily the first steps have already been taken in a congress which had onlv one black member passed public law which underwrote a wide extension of presidential authority supplied criminal penalties for the enforcement of partly unspecified military orders and approved a program which would immediately deprive on the basis of race an entire group of americans of their fundamental civil_rights even more important than pl was the supreme court decision which followed its review of the japanese affair after hearing two cases one contesting the legality of the curfew imposed on a single ethnic group japanese and the other contesting the legality of the imprisonment itself the court hearing both cases long after the events declared both the curfew and the evacuation constitutional civil liberties are not absolute matters when liberties come into conflict with pressing public necessities liberties must give way whatever its shortcomings the famous holmes criterion of clear and present danger has in recent years been the most frequently utilized test of the us supreme court in determining the legality of civil liberties deprivations when the larger public stands in clear and present danger as the result of exercise of traditional liberties then one has no right to those liberties the magnitude of the civil liberties deprivation must be judged in terms of the threat to the common welfare in one of the dissenting opinions mr justice murphy said the evacuation fell into the ugly abyss of racism continuing he said that the true test of evacuation was whether the civil liberties deprivation was reasonably related to a public danger that is so immediate imminent and impending as not to admit of delay and not to permit the intervention of ordinary constitutional processes to alleviate the danger the oncoming summer may provide just such a climateand there is obviously constitutional precedent for wholesale incarceration on the basis of race alone in the event the larger public feels it is in clear and present danger and you know who the larger public is the mccarran internal security act aimed ostensibly at subversives further compounds the legal web which is being spun while you watch the act passed in by a congress which had two black members empowers a single person to declare an internal security emergency this catchall term can obviously be applied to any insurrection or civil_rights demonstrationcertainly to all areas in which rioting looting and violence are imminent or in progress and under title ii of the mccarran act six sites in america have been designated as detention camps to receive an intern detainees in the event such an emergency occurs the camps presentlv in varying states of repair and disrepair use and disuse are allenwood pa avon park fla el reno okla wickenburg ariz florence ariz and newell calif several of the camps are technically closed despite some evidence of maintenance others are being used for penal or other purposes very little is known about actual ownership of the avon land with that possible exception the us government has the right of immediate reentry by rozina rajan nyone who goes to africa is bound to hear the music and v to notice that it is different from western music what may not be noticed is that the individual performer has complete freedom for his own individual and inspired variation within fixed limits provided he keeps to the main rules an african performer may introduce as many subtle variations as he pleasesand all conceived on the spur of the moment it is spontaneous music one never hears the same song done exactly the same way when the african makes music what exactly does he do much research is being done on this subject even today and though we know much more about african music no one has yet been able to catch the essence of the african musicand this for many reasons transcribing the musicthe tempo of african music is fairly fast judged by western standards the average speed of drumming is seven unit beats per second this would be manageable if african music were susceptible to regular time bars time and so on but it is not the african approach to rhythm is largely additive and so one is confronted with a series of rhythmic motifs of everchanging timelength which can only be intelligibly set down in a series of bars of continually changing value the only way possible to capture these rhythms is to devise some apparatus which will write down on a moving strip of paper every beat made by each instrument at the instant it is made recording on a gramophone and with a tape machine have failed to accurately measure the distance of one note from another besides this one has to discover the rhythms themselves and the musical pitch of each drum beat when the africans beat drums they play tunes on their drums therefore rhythm and time both have to be transcribed these are difficult to compare with the spontaneous creations of the master drummer at the very moment he plays them the social setting of the music has to be considered before the music as a whole can be said to have been mastered this is difficult when determining the rhythm of the song in a dance and its incidence with the other instruments such is the unity of the african music with african social life drumming and dancing are the center and climax of african music and it is necessary to pay attention to features of musical topology to the relation between speechtone and melody in singing because each tribe possesses its own musical idiosyncrasies it is very hard to transcribe african music so far i have tried to point out from my own experience and from the viewpoints of other musicologists why african music is a new field and why no one has yet been able to transcribe authoritatively its essence i have used the drum as an example because that is the first instrument that is heard in african music of any tribe another difficulty encountered in the transcribing of the african music is its norm the full ensemble of the dance all other forms of music are secondary the full ensemble consists of the instruments of the orchestra the handclapping the song and the dance these four ingredients combine to form the central act of african musicmaking in the full performance with singing and drumming we have the flower of african musical genius the highest manifestation of the art and the most spontaneously creative expression of the soul of music different tribes use different instruments but almost all use drums beneath all this diversity lies a unity of attitude to the dance for a large part of the african continent there are two fundamental principles of african music with special reference to handclapping and the accompanying songs the rhythm the melody the scoring of the drums the tuning and finally the instruments of the african orchestra are separately treated but one must remember that all these go together to give that mysterious and spiritual element to african music as to the religious element in african music almost all musicologists believe that africans had clearcut concepts of the role of music in life music permeates virtually every important phase of living in africa from birth to death singing related to religious activity had a specific character and specific requirements most africans had their own concepts of a supreme though not necessarily exclusive deity in many instances this deity tended to be somewhat remote and the africans dealingssupplicative invocational and placativewere with lesser supernatural beings many of whom had epic histories those who served these deities sang songs of praise much of the oral religious literature of the african consisted less of prayers as we think of them than of dramatic statements in the form of songs relating to the deities this is also very true of indian music and dance which originated in the form of prayers to the gods however the two fundamental principles of african music are the tunebackground of the music be it handclap or a pestlebeat or a swish of the paddles in a canoesong or whatever the rhythmic background the melody of the song attaches each syllable to its appropriate note that is the words and the time are inseparable handclapping is a normal way of providing percussive effect and maintaining a rhythmic pulse for singinga musical device of african derivation it is used in most childrens ring games and playparty songs clapping beat may or may not coincide with melodic accents often the clapping sounds fall squarely between the stressed voice tones and constitute a regular offbeat natalie curtis in her songs and tales from the dark continent has been able to transcribe correctly the wide spread african clap or bell pattern which might well be described as the african signature time and which is this she has noted down the time accurately but has not recognized its rhythm here is an example to illustrate the variety in african musical phrases the songfor girls the agbada river has caught me o i say that the todzie river has caught me o they say the wind on the lagoon has caught me o people should rescue me and may god guide me the song is the game the children form a ring the cantor starts the song and the chorus joins in all clap hands with a slow stroking movement moving their bodies too but without shifting their ground the musicthe song is common time throughout the claps fall on the first beat of each bar the song consists of claps it is not bars because it is the claps which are the timebackbone of the song the bars do not exist so far as the african is concerned the song consists of groups of claps the rest of the song is one phrase of four claps the total is claps the african musical phrase does not exist the african phrases are built up of the numbers or their multiples of a combination of and or the multiples of this combination thus this phrase of is thus repeated the division being the song is in call and response form though on repeats the chorus sings the whole of it most african singing is built on this cantor and chorus basis though there are a number of different ways in which the principle may be developed to illustrate the rhythmic fusion of dancing singing and clappinga song for little boys and girls ahiavia yeye tsoe da de abatia dzi nam loo ahiavia gbogbo tsoe da de abatia dzi nam loo my small lover you are welcome put it on the bed for me it refers to the headkerchief the boy has brought as a present all form a circle one child acts as cantor and starts singing at the word yeye they all clap after the song has started any one dancer moves into the circle dances for about three repeats and dances out to herhis former place music the one feature that should be noticed is at the word yeye the syncopation here occurs three timesonly at the beginning and no where else there are two claps to this song which are performed simultaneously some children doing one and some the other without prearrangement the first is a regular succession of claps of crochet value of the same intensity if the second clap is performed by itself and without the song it appears to be of a certain regular pattern but it is not quite this in order to get the rhythm of the second clap the performer adds silently in his head some extra claps during the rests in his pattern and mentally plays the following pattern in combination with clap one thus the rhythm established is two claps and a pauserepeat there are crochets to the whole song ie rose brandel in her transcripts makes the important contribution of the realization that the pitch of the drums and of their individual drumbeats is important she actually gives the pitch of one drum b b below middle c for other drums she gives the relative pitches of the drumnotes forming the musical patterns of each drum but she does not correlate the pitches of the several drums with one another she is aware of the polyrhythms of the drum music but does not realize the fundamental principles involved the scoring of the drums presents another problem with melodic instruments used in the west the scores indicates the pitch of the notes required there is no need to show how they are produced but with the african drums the situation is different in the first place the drum does not give out a clearly defined note which the ear can easily recognize as being of definite pitch moreover there is a difference in pitch of one drum note to another a difference that extends over more than an octave african drumbeats vary not only in pitch but also in quality therefore it is important in the case of drumming to know which hand a performer uses for any given note and how he played the note the score should ideally show not only the rhythm and the pitch of the notes but also how each note was made to place the drum notes on a musical stave facts have to be considered which hand played it what position on the drumskin it was played whether or not the other hand was also employed simultaneously in producing it and if so in what way the drums the core of the african instrumentation are often grouped in sets or families of three they are of various sizes as high as three feet and are made of hollow logs covered at one end by sheep hide this instrument of african parentage so popular today was and still is used in many remote areas of africa used for a variety of purposes for calling and signalling announcing death social dances harvest rites wakes and funerals the beats of all the other instruments shows a very high state of development it is especially complex and subtle in its rhythmic organization the very essence of african music is to cross the rhythms this does not mean syncopation by crossing the rhythm we mean if two africans are drumming in triple time and at the same speed the main beat of the bars of no drum will fall either on the second beat or on the third beat of number one drum but never on the first this is absolutely fundamental to african music the same is true of indian music and indian tabla small drums we find here the same movement from complication of rhythm and meter to greater unity and coincidence that was found in indian and other oriental music orchestraafrican stylewith particular reference to rwe a west african tribe the orchestra consists of three sections the background rhythm section the drum section and claps and song the instruments include the drums the double bell gonkogui two high pitched gongs called atoke each with its playing rod made of iron similar instruments are used by different tribes and are called by different names but they play the same role as mentioned here the background rhythmic sectionthe gonkogui is the foundation of the section it is a double clapperless belltwo bells welded at the top to form a tine by which it is held when played with a stick it gives two clear notes in which the upper partials are inaudible this provides the background rhythm which keeps the whole orchestra in time what gonkogui plays is a rhythm pattern and not a succession of regular beats the one responsible for the actual tempo is the master drummer the gonkogui is accompanied by axatse a rattle the rattle pattern is derived from those of gonggong but is not identical again different tribes have different playing techniques the rattle shake gives an intense clattering sound of high pitch the downward stroke produces a low slightly muffled sound the upward stroke sounds crisp and high atoke is another gonglike instrument which is used as background rhythm small and boatshaped it is couched in the hand without the fingers touching the ends the desired sound is a very high rather thin and slightly metallic singing tone the drums are the most important section of the orchestra forming its main body about four drums are used normally i have already explained the rhythm and the score involved however what the exact factors are which determine the tuning is a difficult matter to find what exactly is the african listening to it is not a case of absolute pitch it must be so tuned that the notes rise and fall very clearly the third section of the orchestra is the song and its attendant handclapping the handclap is the rhythmic link between the song and the other instruments so true of other tribal music the clap phrase and the phrases of the instrument supplying background music eg gonkogui are always in the same phrase one with the other the songs are in free rhythm though this is illusory when the song is sung and repeated its syllables and claps fall in exactly the same equivalent places in the gonkogui pattern in this instance finally in most african music tension operates within the phrase and is the organizing articulating principle of the phrase but tension does not perform an overall organizing function except in the sense that it creates a type of variations form these instruments though lacking the precision of western technology still recognizably belong to the familiar families of wind string and percussiononly they produce a dilferent rhythm and a different melody so appealing and pleasant to the ear considering afroamerican folk music it is difficult to explore it or understand it properly without recognizing its african heritage this does not mean that afroamerican music is african but that many characteristics of african musical styles persist to this day two of these characteristics are melodic and rhythmic concepts which are most noticeable and easily recognized in order to captivate the essence of african music it is necessary not only to hear it but to see it with ones own eyes the drummer beating the drums the dancers dancing in complete harmony with the drumbeatings and the singers singing in complete harmony with the clapping no matter how strange it may sound in the beginning if hearing for the first time one is soon absorbed in tapping the floor with the foot or clapping the hands mentally if not audibly aime cesaire by ellen conroy kennedy e had arrived in the w middle of the first world festival of negro arts a three week international spectacle held in the senegalese capital in april bringing together from africa europe the caribbean north and south america black artists writers performers scholars in expositions of every art form from ancient to contemporary in handicraft sculpture painting dance theater music films literaturethe whole prefaced by a weeklong colloquium on the function and meaning of negro art in the life of the people see negro digestjune july august september the exhilaration was contagious my own was dampened only by the fatigue of a transatlantic flight and the knowledge we had missed by just a few hours the nuit de la poesie a gala evening of dramatic readings by the senegalese actor bachir toure followed by the solemn awarding of festival prizes in the numerous categories of competition a poetry reading the key event of a festival of negro arts yes but for the selfaffirmative poetry through which years earlier a small group of african and west indian students in paris found their authentic voice rediscovered what they called their negritude the festival would never have taken place it was through this extraordinary body of writings the poems of aime cesaire leopold senghor birago and david diop bernard dadie jacques rabemananjara and othersthat negritude first found expression it has matured since then from a simple protest against cultural assimilation into a cultural philosophy now articulated by leopold senghor president of senegal as a new humanism in which the negros special contribution to world culture will at last have a fully recognized share so the marriage of a gala poetry reading and the awarding of festival prizes was particularly fitting i scanned the pages of dakar matin for a report of the evening and the literary prizes the elder poets aime cesaire and leopold senghor for example were not in the running of course from their group had come the juries to single out for honors writers of a younger generation cesaire who invented negritude philosophical premise of the festival and leader of the literary school grown up around it had headed the french language literary jury i read while the american poet langston hughes was chairman of the english language section it was these elders whose work is still so little translated and so little known in the united states who drew my interest most theirs were the works knew and would teach i would have a chance to meet many of them i was soon told at a special postcolloquium session where the madagascan poetstatesman jacques rabemananjara would speak two evenings later that evening aime cesaire leon damas alioune diop bernard dadie birago diop most of the festivals french language literary notables though not that visitorfromanotherplanet evgeny yevtuschenko were circulating among the crowd gathered in the lobby of the assemblee nationale w the effect was rather like seeing mallarme rimbaud verlaine corbiere and laforgue all in one room only negritudes baudelaire president senghor seemed to be missing yet his presence was felt in every way but the physical since the festival was surely his creation more than any other single persons langston hughes was on hand too autographing books in green ink with wide round palmer method letters for mr hughes was one of the surviving grand old men of the s harlem renaissance his poems and stories together with those of gaude mackay countee cullen and jean toomer had had a profound impact on the originators of negritude negro students from french colonies in africa and the caribbean who read them in paris a decade later like hughes cesaire was seated at a card table chatting with clusters of admirers writing gracious dedications in copies of the various works they presented him his poetry les armes miraculeuses ferrements cadastre his plays one of which la tragedie du roi christophe later marked a high point of the festival with senghor and haile selassie in gala attendance his essays the discours sur le colonialisme the lettre a maurice thorez his resignation from the french communist party and his study of the haitian revolutionary toussaint vouverture i recognized him instantly with something of a start yet how could one have expected to find the same young militant whose dark face incendiary eyes and radiant white smile glow forth from a photograph today in his fifties the poets eyes are softened with spectacles his face a trifle lined and heavier his fervor perhaps not dampened but seasoned by more than years as poet parliamentarian for the former lycee professor is also the longtime mayor of his home town fortaufrance and deputy from his island martinique to the chambre des deputes in paris turning his attention toward us cesaire flashed the invincible magnetic smile edouard maunick the young mauritian poet we had met the day before murmured an introduction i passed monsieur cesaire several volumes to autograph mentioning my regret at not having found a copy of his first and still bestknown work cahier dun retour au pays natal this is the poem the late andre breton dean of french surrealists called nothing less than the greatest lyric monument of our time in which he discovered that major tone which distinguishes great from lesser poets publication of les armes miraculeuses just after world war ii and of the first complete edition of the cahier soon afterwards established cesaire in the front rank of french poets he was hailed as the great renewer of surrealism though his originality was far more than simply stylistic the ethnic element his magnificent messianic identification with all peoples of african heritage these thematic qualities were still more distinctive the poets close friend senghor has spoken of the cahiers parturition in pain the pain of its genesis in the year old poets anguished confrontation with the misery of his island his people his race a dramatic monologue of some pages his notes on a return to the native land begins as a bitterly ironic inventory of rage despair and frustration to become an exorcism and then an acceptance an immense surging affirmation of the poets negroness of all negroness and a personal dedication to its cause you know it is not from hate for other races that i seek to be the plowman of this single race what i wish for the universal hunger for the universal thirst is to shake it free at last to summon from its inner depths the succulence of fruit if leon damas startling poems pigments were the first rejection of cultural assimilation cesaires cahier written in was the first direct lyric proclamation of negritude his words as jeanpaul sartre has put it do not describe negritude they do not designate it they do not copy it from outside as a painter does a model they make it they compose it under our eyes one of the great poems of our century the cahier dun retour au pays natal is the literary movements inspirational emblem the one incomparable work to which all african and west indian poets in french refer in whose stature they are measured alas the cahier was temporarily out of print cesaire said and when would there be a new american edition i knew there had been a bilingual version of only copies with translations by ivan goll and lionel abel published in by brentanos in new york surely it was time it were available again a cuban refugee we knew owned wifredo lams original drawings for another edition the frenchspanish one published in havana in couldnt an american publisher put them together for a new frenchenglish edition why not smiled cesaire and as for the drawings if the old ones were not enough perhaps wifredo would make new ones had he lams address yes in a notebook at his brothers villa where he was staying during the festival the poet jotted down a phone number on a tiny leaf of graphed notepaper asking us to call a few days later since he was leaving the city that evening cesaire and one or two other close friends maunick later told us would be spending those few days in casamance the lush southern part of senegal as guests of president senghor but now others were waiting to speak to the poet we said goodbye and moved on the interview itself came about unexpectedly i phoned on the appointed afternoon cesaire had just lunched he would be tied up the following day our last in dakar but now he had an hour to spare before the dress rehearsal of la tragedie du roi christophe cesaires play about the rise and fall of henrichristophe despot ruler of independent th century haiti was a highpoint of the festival its pertinence to the careers of certain contemporary african statesmen was not lost on the dakar audience would my husband and i care to come over right away we were delighted and asked if we could bring along a journalist friend who was also anxious to meet him the taxi left us in front of a large townhouse just visible through the iron gate in a sixfoot high wall we rang and cesaire himself came down to meet us ushering us through a small garden up a flight of stairs to the parlor floor we stepped through a corridor into a spacious highceilinged room its coolness refreshing after the almost blinding sunshine outside a tall shuttered window on the far side was open letting in the sea breeze that brings relief in dakar even from the intense midday heat leaning out one caught a green glimpse framed in the deep blue of sky and water of the ancient fortress island goree here for more than years captives from the african interior were held prisoner in slavedepots before their deportation west to the americas a museum now the prison can be reached by motor launch from the harbor of dakar in minutes during the festival it was the scene of a nightly soundandlight spectacular we shook hands and i introduced the journalist friend who had accompanied us did monsieur cesaire understand english more or less he indicated though he preferred not to try to speak it we decided to put our questions in french and i would interpret if needed occasionally as we talked he would repeat a question in french to check that he had understood it properly as he spoke i noticed he had the trace of a lisp it interfered not at all with the warmth the thoughtfulness and precision with which he talked sometimes moving forward in his chair occasionally breaking into smiles pausing or altering his inflection to emphasize a point where white and black meet by frantz fanon ie negro to whites is a phobogenic object a stimulus to anxiety from the patient treated by serieux and capgras to the girl who confides to me that to go to bed with a negro would be terrifying to her one discovers all the stages of what i shall call the negrophobogenesis there has been much talk of psychoanalysis in connection with the negro distrusting the ways in which it might be applied i have preferred to call this chapter the negro and psychopathology well aware that freud and adler and even the cosmic jung did not think of the negro in all their investigations and they were quite right not to have it is too often forgotten that neurosis is not a basic element of human reality like it or not the oedipus complex is far from coming into being among negroes it might be argued as malinowski contends that the matriarchal structure is the only reason for its absence but putting aside the question whether the ethnologists are not so imbued with the complexes of their own civilization that they are compelled to try to find them duplicated in the peoples they study it would be relatively easy for me to show that in the french antilles per cent of the families cannot produce one oedipal neurosis this incapacity is one on which we heartily congratulate ourselves with the exception of a few misfits within the closed environment we can say that every neurosis every abnormal manifestation every affective erethism in an antillean is the product of his cultural situation in other words there is a constellation of postulates a series of propositions that slowly and subtlywith the help of books newspapers schools and their texts advertisements films radiowork their way into ones mind and shape ones view of the world of the group to which one belongs in the antilles that view of the world is white because no black voice exists the folklore of martinique is meager and few children in fortdefrance know the stories of compe lapin twin brother of the brer rabbit of louisianas uncle remus a european familiar with the current trends of negro poetry for example would be amazed to learn that as late as no antillean found it possible to think of himself as a negro it was only with the appearance of aime cesaire that the acceptance of negritude and the statement of its claims began to be perceptible the most concrete proof of this furthermore is that feeling which pervades each new generation of students arriving in paris it takes them several weeks to recognize that contact with europe compels them to face a certain number of problems that until their arrival had never touched them and yet these problems were by no means invisible i whenever i had a discussion with my professors or talked with european patients i became aware of the differences that might prevail between the two worlds talking recently to a physician who had always practiced in fortdefrance i told him what conclusions i had arrived at he went farther saying that they were valid not only in psychopathology but also in general medicine in the same way he added you never encounter a case of pure typhoid such as you studied in the textbooks there is always a more or less manifest complication of malaria it would be interesting to study for example a case of schizophrenia as experienced by a negroif indeed that kind of malady were to be found there what am i getting at quite simply this when the negro makes contact with the white world a certain sensitizing action takes place if his psychic structure is weak one observes a collapse of the ego the black man stops behaving as an actional person the goal of his behavior will be the other in the guise of the white man for the other alone can give him worth that is on the ethical level selfesteem but there is something else i have said that the negro is phobogenic what is phobia i prefer to answer that question by relying on the latest work of hesnard phobia is a neurosis characterized by the anxious fear of an object in the broadest sense of anything outside the individual or by extension of a situation naturally that object must have certain aspects it must arouse hesnard says both fear and revulsion but here we encounter a difficulty applying the genetic method to the understanding of phobia charles odier wrote that all anxiety derives from a certain subjective insecurity linked to the absence of the mother this occurs according to odier sometime in the second year of life investigating the psychic structure of the phobic he comes to this conclusion before attacking the adult beliefs all the elements of the infantile structure which produced them must be analyzed the choice of the phobic object is therefore overdetermined this object does not come at random out of the void of nothingness in some situation it has previously evoked an affect in the patient his phobia is the latent presence of this affect at the root of his world there is an organization that has been given a form for the object naturally need not be there it is enough that somewhere it exist it is a possibility this object is endowed with evil intentions and with all the attributes of a malefic power in the phobic affect has a priority that defies all rational thinking as we can see the phobic is a person who is governed by the laws of rational prelogic and affective prelogic methods of thinking and feeling that go back to the age at which he experienced the event that impaired his security the difficulty indicated here is this was there a trauma harmful to security in the case of the young woman whom we mentioned a little earlier in the majority of negrophobic men has there been an attempt at rape an attempt at fellatio proceeding with complete orthodoxy we should be led by the application of analytic conclusions to this if an extremely frightening object such as a more or less imaginary attacker arouses terror this is alsofor most often such cases are those of womenand especially a terror mixed with sexual revulsion im afraid of men really means at the bottom of the motivation of the fear because they might do all kinds of things to me but not commonplace cruelties sexual abusesin other words immoral and shameful things contact alone is enough to evoke anxiety for contact is at the same time the basic schematic type of initiating sexual action touching caressessexuality since we have learned to know all the tricks the ego uses in order to defend itself we know too that its denials must in no case be taken literally are we not now observing a complete inversion basically does this fear of rape not itself cry out for rape just as there are faces that ask to be slapped can one not speak of women who ask to be raped in if he hollers let him go chester himes describes this type very well the big blonde trembles whenever the negro goes near her yet she has nothing to fear since the factory is full of white men in the end she and the negro go to bed together when i was in military service i had the opportunity to observe the behavior of white women from three or four european countries when they were among negroes at dances most of the time the women made involuntary gestures of flight of withdrawing their faces filled with a fear that was not feigned and yet the negroes who asked them to dance would have been utterly unable to commit any act at all against them even if they had wished to do so the behavior of these women is clearly understandable from the standpoint of imagination that is because the negrophobic woman is in fact nothing but a putative sexual partner just as the negrophobic man is a repressed homosexual in relation to the negro everything takes place on the genital level a few years ago i remarked to some friends during a discussion that in a general sense the white man behaves toward the negro as an elder brother reacts to the birth of a younger i have since learned that richard sterba arrived at the same conclusion in america on the phenomenological level there would be a double reality to be observed the jew is feared because of his potential for acquisitiveness they are everywhere the banks the stock exchanges the government are infested with them they control everything soon the whole country will belong to them they do better in examinations than the real frenchmen soon they will be making the laws for us not long ago an acquaintance studying for the civil service said to me say what you want they take good care of one another when moch was in power for instance the number of kikes in government jobs was appalling in the medical profession the situation is no different every jewish student who wins a prize in a competition does it through pull as for the negroes they have tremendous sexual powers what do you expect with all the freedom they have in their jungles they copulate at all times and in all places they are really genital they have so many children that they cannot even count them be careful or they will flood us with little mulattoes things are indeed going to hell the government and the civil service are at the mercy of the jews our women are at the mercy of the negroes for the sexual potency of the negro is hallucinating that is indeed the word this potency must be hallucinating psychoanalysts who study the problem soon enough find the mechanisms of every neurosis sexual anxiety is predominant here all the negrophobic women i have known had abnormal sex lives their husbands had left them or they were widows and they were afraid to find a substitute for the dead husband or they were divorced and they had doubts at the thought of a new object investment all of them endowed the negro with powers that other men husbands transient lovers did not have and besides there was also an element of perversion the persistence of infantile formations god knows how they make love it must be terrifying there is one expression that through time has become singularly eroticized the black athlete there is something in the mere idea one young woman confided to me that makes the heart skip a beat a prostitute told me that in her early days the mere thought of going to bed with a negro brought on an orgasm she went in search of negroes and never asked them for money but she added going to bed with them was no more remarkable than going to bed with white men it was before i did it that i had the orgasm i used to think about imagine all the things they might do to me and that was what was so terrific still on the genital level when a white man hates black men is he not yielding to a feeling of impotence or of sexual inferiority since his ideal is an infinite virility is there not a phenomenon of diminution in relation to the negro who is viewed as a penis symbol is the lynching of the negro not a sexual revenge we know how much of sexuality there is in all cruelties tortures beatings one has only to reread a few pages of the marquis de sade to be easily convinced of the fact is the negros superiority real everyone knows that it is not but that is not what matters the prelogical thought of the phobic has decided that such is the case another woman developed a negrophobia after she had read jirai cracher sur vos tombes i tried to demonstrate the irrationality of her position by pointing out to her that victimized white women were as sick as the negro besides i added this was no case of black vengeance as the title of the book might seem to imply because the author was a white man boris vian i had to accept the futility of all such efforts that young woman did not want to listen anyone who has read the book will understand at once the ambivalence her phobia revealed i knew a negro medical student who would not dare to make a vaginal examination of any patient in the gynecological clinic he told me that one day he had heard one of them say theres a nigger in there if he touches me ill slap his face you never know with them he must have great big hands and besides hes sure to be rough if one wants to understand the racial situation psychoanalytically not from a universal viewpoint but as it is experienced by individual consciousnesses considerable importance must be given to sexual phenomena in the case of the jew one thinks of money and its cognates in that of the negro one thinks of sex antisemitism can be rationalized on a basic level it is because he takes over the country that the jew is a danger an acquaintance told me recently that although he was not an antisemite he had been constrained to admit that the majority of jews whom he had known during the war had behaved very badly i tried in vain to get him to concede that such a statement was the fruit of a determined desire to find the essence of the jew wherever it might exist on a clinical level i am reminded of the story of the young woman who suffered from a kind of tactile delirium constantly washing her hands and arms ever since the day a jew had been introduced to her jeanpaul sartre has made a masterful study of the problem of antisemitism let us try to determine what are the constituents of negrophobia this phobia is to be found on an instinctual biological level at the extreme i should say that the negro because of his body impedes the closing of the postural schema of the white manat the point naturally at which the black man makes his entry into the phenomenal world of the white man this is not the place in which to state the conclusions i drew from studying the influence exerted on the body by the appearance of another body let us assume for example that four fifteenyearold boys all more or less athletic are doing the high jump one of them wins by jumping four feet ten inches then a fifth boy arrives and tops the mark by a halfinch the four other bodies experience a destructuration what is important to us here is to show that with the negro the cycle of the biological begins the penis the symbol of manhood is annihilated which is to say that it is denied the difference between the two attitudes is apparent the jew is attacked in his religious identity in his history in his race in his relations with his ancestors and with his posterity when one sterilizes a jew one cuts off the source every time that a jew is persecuted it is the whole race that is persecuted in his person but it is in his corporeality that the negro is attacked it is as a concrete personality that he is lynched it is as an actual being that he is a threat the jewish menace is replaced by the fear of the sexual potency of the negro o mannoni said an argument widely used by racialists against those who do not share their convictions is worthy of mention for its revealing character what they say if you had a daughter do you mean to say that you would marry her to a negro i have seen people who appeared to have no racialist bias lose all critical sense when confronted with this kind of question the reason is that such an argument disturbs certain uneasy feelings in them more exactly incestuous feelings and they turn to racialism as a defence reaction before we go further it seems important to make this point granted that unconscious tendencies toward incest exist why should these tendencies emerge more particularly with respect to the negro in what way taken as an absolute does a black soninlaw differ from a white soninlaw is there not a reaction of unconscious tendencies in both cases why not for instance conclude that the father revolts because in his opinion the negro will introduce his daughter into a sexual universe for which the father does not have the key the weapons or the attributes every intellectual gain requires a loss in sexual potential the civilized white man retains an irrational longing for unusual eras of sexual license of orgiastic scenes of unpunished rapes of unrepressed incest in one way these fantasies respond to freuds life instinct projecting his own desires onto the negro the white man behaves as if the negro really had them when it is a question of the jew the problem is clear he is suspect because he wants to own the wealth or take over the positions of power but the negro is fixated at the genital or at any rate he has been fixated there two realms the intellectual and the sexual an erection on rodins thinker is a shocking thought one cannot decently have a hard on everywhere the negro symbolizes the biological danger the jew the intellectual danger to suffer from a phobia of negroes is to be afraid of the biological for the negro is only biological the negroes are animals they go about naked and god alone knows mannoni said further in his urge to identify the anthropoid apes caliban the negroes even the jews with the mythological figures of the satyrs man reveals that there are sensitive spots in the human soul at a level where thought becomes confused and where sexual excitement is strangely linked with violence and aggressiveness mannoni includes the jew in his scale i see nothing inappropriate there but here the negro is the master he is the specialist of this matter whoever says rape says negro over three or four years i questioned some members of the white racefrench german english italian i took advantage of a certain air of trust of relaxation in each instance i waited until my subject no longer hesitated to talk to me quite openlythat is until he was sure that he would not offend me or else in the midst of associational tests i inserted the word negro among some twenty others almost per cent of the replies took this form negro brought forth biology penis strong athletic potent boxer joe louis jesse owens senegalese troops savage animal devil sin senegalese soldier used as the stimulus evoked dreadful bloody tough strong it is interesting to note that one in fifty reacted to the word negro with nazi or when one knows the emotional meaning of the ss image one recognizes that the difference from the other answers is negligible let me add that some europeans helped me by giving the test to their acquaintances in such cases the proportion went up notably from this result one must acknowledge the effect of my being a negro unconsciously there was a certain reticence the negro symbolizes the biological first of all he enters puberty at the age of nine and is a father at the age of ten he is hotblooded and his blood is strong he is tough as a white man remarked to me not long ago with a certain bitterness you all have strong constitutions what a beautiful racelook at the senegalese werent they called our black devils during the war but they must be brutal i just cant see them putting those big hands of theirs on my shoulders i shudder at the mere thought of it well aware that in certain cases one must interpret by opposites i understand this extrafragile woman at bottom what she wants most is to have the powerful negro bruise her frail shoulders sartre says that when one speaks the phrase a young jewess there is an imaginary reek of rape and pillage conversely we might say that the expression a handsome negro contains a possible allusion to similar phenomena i have always been struck by the speed with which handsome young negro turns into young colt or stallion in the film mourning becomes electra a good part of the plot is based on sexual rivalry orin rebukes his sister vinnie because she admired the splendid naked natives of the south seas he cannot forgive her for it analysis of the real is always difficult an investigator can choose between two attitudes toward his subject first he can be satisfied only to describe in the manner of those anatomists who are all surprised when in the midst of a description of the tibia they are asked how many fibular depressions they have that is because in their researches there is never a question of themselves but of others in the beginning of my medical studies after several nauseating sessions in the dissection room i asked an older hand how i could prevent such reactions my friend pretend youre dissecting a cat and everything will be all right second once he has described reality the investigator can make up his mind to change it in principle however the decision to describe seems naturally to imply a critical approach and therefore a need to go farther toward some solution both authorized and anecdotal literature have created too many stories about negroes to be suppressed but putting them all together does not help us in our real task which is to disclose their mechanics what matters for us is not to collect facts and behavior but to find their meaning here we can refer to jaspers when he wrote comprehension in depth of a single instance will often enable us phenomenologically to apply this understanding in general to innumerable cases often what one has once grasped is soon met again what is important in phenomenology is less the study of a large number of instances than the intuitive and deep understanding of a few individual cases the question that arises is this can the white man behave healthily toward the black man and can the black man behave healthily toward the white man a pseudoquestion some will say but when we assert that european culture has an imago of the negro which is responsible for all the conflicts that may arise we do not go beyond reality in the chapter on language we saw that on the screen the negro faithfully reproduces that imago even serious writers have made themselves its spokesmen so it was that michel cournot could write the black mans sword is a sword when he has thrust it into your wife she has really felt something it is a revelation in the chasm that it has left your little toy is lost pump away until the room is awash with your sweat you might as well just be singing this is goodby four negroes with their penises exposed would fill a cathedral they would be unable to leave the building until their erections had subsided and in such close quarters that would not be a simple matter to be comfortable without problems they always have the open air but then they are faced with a constant insult the palm tree the breadfruit tree and so many other proud growths that would not slacken for an empire erect as they are for all eternity and piercing heights that are not easily reached at any price when one reads this passage a dozen times and lets oneself gothat is when one abandons oneself to the movement of its imagesone is no longer aware of the negro but only of a penis the negro is eclipsed he is turned into a penis he is a penis it is easy to imagine what such descriptions can stimulate in a young girl in lyon horror lust not indifference in any case now what is the truth the average length of the penis among the black men of africa dr pales says rarely exceed millimeters inches testut in his traite danatomie hwnaine offers the same figure for the european but these are facts that persuade no one the white man is convinced that the negro is a beast if it is not the length of the penis then it is the sexual potency that impresses him face to face with this man who is different from himself he needs to defend himself in other words to personify the other the other will become the mainstay of his preoccupations and his desires the prostitute whom i mentioned earlier told me that her hunt for negroes dated from the time when she had been told this story one night a woman who was in bed with a negro went mad she remained insane for two years but then when she had been cured refused to go to bed with anyone else the prostitute did not know what had driven the other woman mad but she sought furiously to reproduce the same situation to discover this secret which was part of the ineffable one must recognize that what she wanted was the destruction the dissolution of her being on a sexual level every experiment that she made with a negro reinforced her limitations this delirium of orgasm was unattainable she could not experience it so she avenged herself by losing herself in speculation one thing must be mentioned in this connection a white woman who has had a negro lover finds it difficult to return to white men or so at least it is believed particularly by white men who knows what they can give a woman who indeed does know certainly they do not on this subject i cannot overlook this comment by etiemble racial jealousy produces the crimes of racism to many white men the black is simply that marvelous sword which once it has transfixed their wives leaves them forever transfigured my statistical sources have been able to provide me with no documentation on this point i have however known some negroes some white women who have had negroes and finally some negro women who have had white lovers i have heard enough confidences from all of them to be able to deplore the fact that m cournot applies his talents to the rejuvenation of a fable in which the white man will always be able to find a specious argument shameful dubious and thus doubly effective crisis of consciousness by richard a long american artist of african descent has j ii r had certain options l he could insulate himself as anist and a person usually by expatriation he could keep his art pure while reacting personally to his condition he could respond to that condition by and with his artistic expressivity these choices have roughly characterized three periods of expression in the plastic arts by afroamericans while no means alone henry ossawa tanner illustrates the first option a pupil of thomas eakins he reflects some of the lessons of that master in the banjo lesson now at hampton institute this painting is clearly a masterpiece of the american genre school but in seeking his artistic identity tanner found it necessary to go to france as had eakins before him and unlike eakins to remain there a portion of tanners considerable achievement has been recognized in a recent exhibition at new yorks grand central galleries the second option is demonstrated by laura wheeler waring she like tanner and the sculptress meta warrick fuller was a graduate of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts she followed a career in teaching all the while painting portraits and stilllife with quiet elegance and style the third option that of using art as the means of expressing a distinct ethnic identity in the context of american society did not appear yesterday during the twenties the period of the harlem renaissance it was the explicit program of young writers such as langston hughes it received the encouragement of alain locke and james weldon johnson who were the revered spokesmen of an older generation the work of aaron douglas at that time was hailed as reflecting this spirit in painting and it was he who was selected to illustrate dr lockes the new negro and other ethnic books of the period dr locke remained ever on the search for an artist who would embody his ideal of an ethnic afroamerican expression nevertheless the harlem renaissance did not produce artists who could be fully compared with its writers in this respect the problems of the artist are different and he reacts differently formal considerations arise which place questions of subject and content aside sometimes for a long period some times indefinitely two examples may be mentioned the first is w h johnson born in in south carolina he studied at the national academy of design in new york in the early twenties in he went to france remaining there until nineteenthirty found him once more in europe this time in denmark where he married a danish artist only in was he once more in the u s where world war ii forced him to remain until his works after student days reflect a cezannesque french period an expressionistic scandinavian period and an astounding primitive american period the result of the artistic rediscovery of his ethnic origins in the highly sophisticated vision of his exile was rudely displaced by a basic upheaval even more imperative than it at first seemed for a mental collapse followed the first large scale exhibition of johnsons work was held at the college museum hampton institute in the spring of drawing on hamptons holdings and those of the national collection of fine arts both gifts of the harmon foundation beauford delaney a painter of the same generation as johnson went from rural kentucky to boston where his studies at the school of fine arts began with drawings from the antique he came to new york at the end of the twenties as the harlem renaissance was drawing to a close his personal vision led him from an early academicism to a hearty expressionism culminating in a long series of green street paintings in the forties beauford delaney went to paris in the fifties where his evolution has been toward an abstract impressionism of great subtlety ever an ethnically conscious person delaneys long absence from the united states has been in no sense an exile his rumination in the past and his active contemplation of the present encompass the broad spectrum of black experience in america his new york period has been apotheosized by henry miller in remember to remember and the paris period by james baldwin in a glowing tribute printed as introduction to delaneys galerie lambert show an ensemble of his work has been on permanent exhibition at morgan state college in baltimore since the artistic program of the harlem renaissance was partially realized by a number of artists who first appeared during the wpa period such as charles alston jacob lawrence and charles sebree associated with the mood and spirit of the wpa are the mexicaninspired murals of hale woodruff at talladega and at atlanta university and of charles white at hampton institute there was a tendency during the wpa period to see the afroamerican experience from either a populist or marxist viewpoint and therefore as part of a universal one the artists tended to regard the content of their work as reflecting in a particular way a universal problem concomitant with this then was a general feeling that no identification of an artist as negro or afroamerican was desirable or necessary this may be said to have been the position of most afroamerican artists in the period from the end of the depression to less than four years ago what then has happened why do we now hear of afroamerican artists what is the significance of an exhibition which can draw people to the great hall of city university in new york as did the evolution of afroamerican artists last october no simple answer is possible it must be remembered though that there was a similar exhibition assembled by alonzo aden in chicago in hence what we are witnessing may be cyclical on the other hand there are two influences one international and one domestic to which the artist necessarily responds the domestic one which has been summed up in the slogans white backlash and black_power the first certainly preceded the second hence why not white power and black backlash is an increasing source of personal frustration to all americans of african descent the second is negritude a philosophy of african values and insights proposed as a substitute foror complement toeuroamerican materialist values a philosophy which not unsurprisingly finds its immediate source in the harlem renaissance the crisis of consciousness which the afroamerican artist is undergoing today is similar to that of the entire community to which he belongs a community which is in large part of somebody elses making the observed ferment may be an attempt on the part of that community to remake itself in a manner that is emotionally satisfying the role of the artist in this enterprise could be a great one beg your pardon my dear sirbut you canf t possibly be an african on the contrary the gentleman pictured here is a tribal chieftain from the province of timbo in guinea one of the frenchspeaking countries of west africa and the ancestral home of many thousands of american negroes he is a slender proud amberhued young man who divested of his traditional boubou and dressed in western attire would be indistinguishable from any other goodlooking intelligent young man seen say on the streets of detroit or atlanta to a nation of people accustomed to thinking of africans in the images fostered for so long by the communications media the guinean might come as a shock but he is very real and very african what then is an african an african is a person from africa just as an american is a person from america and there are at least as many variations in the colors and facial characteristics of africans as there are among americans an african might be a blueeyed blond from the kabyles of algeria or an ebonyblack wolof from senegal what the people of these extremely divergent groups have in common as do hundreds of groups ranging between their two poles is a heritage on the african continent which goes back many hundreds of years throughout the centuries there have been blending among these various peoples just as there have been among the different groups in europe or asia or the americas and just as there always will be where human beings come together american movies cartoons news features and often television shows have tended to picture africans as primitive sometimes savage people without traditions or culture thus contributing criminally to the worlds ignorance but now it is possible to know africans as they truly are the knowledge will enrich you brother malcolm and the black revolution by william keorapetse kgositsile write this with something bordering on fear among many other things malcolm like nationalism is too many different things to too many people perhaps there would be nothing especially unfortunate and regrettable about that but because of the different levels of our consciousness shaped by the varying degrees of filth and cowardice in us our general understanding of malcolm is therefore necessarily a distortion also running through my mind are the following words of setswana wisdom a motswana doctor throws his bones and when they tell him of an irretrievable loss he will say se ileng se ile se ile mosimeng motlhaelathupa lesilo ke moselatedi loosely translated this says what is gone is goneit has qone down the hole theunreachablebyarodthe irrational ie the unwise and illtempered is hewhofollowsit but then again i realize that malik our monumental spiritual thrust is not gone down any hole if we had been stronger and more intelligent in malcolm the brother we thought we knew and admired would still have been with us today and today blackman where is rap brown max stanford mandela sobukweamong many other free black men and women you see until we actually stop these racist maniacs who are opposed to any world order that challenges their decadence and racist perversions they will continue to kill our leaders and any voices which by articulating what is or should be in every black heart become a direct threat to the warped white sensibility and its hideous creations but to stop the madness of these perverts we have to move to positions of power before we can move to positions of power we have to know ourselves so that we can among many other necessary things identify the enemy with a very precise clarity this necessarily involves formulating a revolutionary ideology which will facilitate the building of our selfreliant communities and our veritable social institutions which is where malcolm was at which is why malcolm was murdered but let us look beneath the sore to talk of a revolutionary ideology is to talk about the spirit of a people and malcolm as i have said was our spiritual thrust many people who have written about malcolm have overlooked deliberatelv or unwittingly the importance of his inner landscape his spirit but leroi jones not surprisingly he has been talking about the supremacy of the spirit for the past few years could not overlook such an important aspect of malcotms energy malik was the surse at one point and his relationship to the nation of islam is as graphic a picture of world spirit as exists and his break into a secular political intelligence understanding his murder rendered most of the things directly associated with him into ruin his finally was an abstract energy a symbolizing of certain times of certain spirit he was murdered because he summed up the whole blackwhite struggle in america and the world too easily he has risen in a wide arccircle to embrace a whole public consciousness he was pimpprisoner studentmonk firebrandwiseman and martyr in each place his spirit settled something was turned on and over a beginning an ending jones is talking about what did not die what cannot die which is what we must understand blood to blood we are talking about things deeper than the eye malcolm the mover and the moved the authentic lover fire and love malik the pledge of fire of song the most powerful forces on malcolms inner landscape informed his movement the practical manifestations of his abstract energy which jones talked about fire and love those two forces in the inner landscape are a spiritual measure a way of enabling us to know that we can if we are willing and determined but for us to know if we can actually we must see the promise the hope in us or around us that what we are striving for is w actually possible and know that after that point there can be no turning back malcolm knew he could that we can malcolm was willing and determined malcolm underwent the internal revolution and internalized the black revolution the world revolution brother malcolm was our dream our promise our hope a concrete vector of our desire and possibility the actual embodiment of what wc strive to beintrepid righteous dedicated to the destruction of evil dedicated to the rebuilding of man and our possi bilities as only the sincere lover can be constantly moving to know you love to know you are loved this is supreme this was and will always be the godly power in malcolm his energy spiritual malcolm was our sun our son when we know we love words of love become acts of love recreating the powerful gods in us making us our moment the supreme rhythmthat is the pulse of the most desirable forces in our sensibility which is spiritual we belong to our time we belong to each other through our journey to and in the breath we seek a spiritual cleanliness informing our vision to keep on pushing relentlessly to reshape the world in the image of this vision fire and love greater than our weaknesses or shortcomings past reason or reasonableness create a force relentlessly demanding a complete union with the soul an abstract energy a symbolizing of certain times of certain spirit gwendolyn midlo hall says in st malcolm and the black revolution negro digest november spirituality is a powerful highly contagious emotion and in my view mankinds most profound emotion a revolution in the psyche of one man can become an allpowerful force for social change st malcolm was such a man we can now look at the festering sore the tragedy of our dream deferred malcolm our dream died unprotected i have said before see is the black revolutionist a phony in negro digest july brother malcolm was assassinated at the beginning of his revolutionary maturity because of our collective weakness countless other perverted atrocities are continually perpetrated on us because of our collective weakness brothers what i am driving at is for instance that if our historical enemy now practically our natural enemyknew that should anything have happened to brother malcolm there would be chaos in harlem that night that the following day there wouldnt be a single white store on th street that the very foundations of this system would have to cope with a black uncontrollable power the chances are that brother malcolm would still have been with us i have since realized that one of the major reasons malcolm died unprotected is that many of us who were supposed to did not actually know precisely who we were there is nothing unusual in this filthy world when a very concrete revolutionary man like malcolm is killed by the enemies and oppressors of black people in fact these sinister neoeuropean devils be they in africa asia south or north america have shown us in very exact terms what they are prepared to do to any people who are determined to control their own destiny if they cannot buy you off or scare you or turn you into some freak apologist of their hideous schemes then they organize to isolate and immobilize you or they will kill you we are familiar with what they have done to nkrumah sukarno robert williams mandela sobukwe agostinho neto they even killed luthuli and martin_luther_king who preached a peaceful alternative an appeal based on a level of morality the western whiteman is too beastly to deal with for his own salvation leroi jones has pointed out that the western whiteman cannot even feel because if he could he would feel the pain he is to the majority of the peoples on this planet at the time i am writing this piece these sinister maniacs are carrying out plans to either kill or immobilize every black man they consider a threat to american domestic colonialism and dollarism around the world what they are trying to do to huey newton rap brown eldridge cleaver leroi jones stokely carmichael to name a few is exactly what the french tried to do to the leadership of the algerian liberation front it has happened in all colonial countries i was in detroit recently and there were these devils on tv discussing how they were going to improve their methods of controlling us finally one of them gave the police commissioner orders to arrest brothers glanton dowdell and general baker as soon as any racial incidents broke out i suspect that not knowing precisely who we are we have not always been able to understand what we are up against very clearly the blackwhite relationships and struggle in this country as well as in africa the position of afroamericans in america is that of a colonized people there are three types of colonial situations the first kind is where the colonizers come into the country say as the english did in kenya then they oppress and exploit the people on african soil in the name of some country to which they owe allegiance the second kind of colonial situation is where the settler takes over the country as in south africa or zimbabwe break off ties with whatever european country they owed allegiance to and consider themselves african the amerindians also suffer this kind of colonialism in north america with the third kind european refugee bandits who have usurped a land area like north america oppress and exploit africans they brought over as slaves the conditions of africans under these three kinds of colonialism are the same though the tactics that the colonizer uses on the colonized might vary from place to place which is what malcolm kept hammering at over and over again so that we could better understand who we are in relation to the oppressor pointing out some significant things about the band ung conference malcolm said the same man that was colonizing our people in kenya was colonizing our people in the congo the same one in the congo was colonizing our people in south africa and in southern rhodesia zimbabwe and in burma and in india and in afghanistan and in pakistan they realized all over the world that where the dark man was being oppressed he was being oppressed by the white man where the dark man was being exploited he was being exploited by the white man if we understand this clearly then all the talk about injustice discrimination segregation lack of equality before the law or before any other white institution is just so much sterile crap a trap very carefully worked out by the oppressor to make sure that our minds and feelings remain imprecise as to who we are and what we can actually do but america is doomed as malcolm pointed out with poetic precision so is the rest of the colonial world because we are beginning to be clearer about our roots and identity the gateway to our powerful thrusts into the future with selfrespect malcolm preached a cultural return to africa a strong spiritual bond to guide our goals to guide the formulation of our ideology and the necessary revolutionary tactics and strategies we are beginning to understand who we are historically we are beginning to understand who we are socially our best possible usefulness to our communities we are beginning to understand who we are in our timethe direct relevance of our lives to our strong collective thrusts into the future we are beginning to clearly understand who we are politicallyour direct allegiances and alliances malcolms legacy malcolms purpose and direction malcolms impact on the black revolution the world over nationalism and panafrican unity these and many more of the practical manifestations of malcolms spirit the outer trimmings jones aptly described themhave been talked about in this magazine and many others so i consider it unnecessarily repetitious to talk about them one thing though i will point out malcolm like nkrumah toure moumie the cameroonian brother who the french poisoned with thallium nyerere fanon ho chi minhto name just a few among our many heroes who have earned our respecttaught us to get rid of our fear and cowardice and wage an uncompromising total struggle like our vietnamese brothers no concessions malcolm warned us because to look forward toand to expect concessions fromthe oppressor is to put yourself in to the trick bag the enemy has until recently been successful in placing us in the nature of this paradox is ridiculous i desire what i do not desire concessions lead you away from revolutionary struggle lessening your chances of liberation revolution is based on land land is the basis of all independence land is the basis of freedom justice and equality brother malcolm taught us because it is on land that a people builds a nation the setswana word for peace is kagisano which literally means building together brother malcolm continued revolution is bloody revolution is hostile revolution knows no compromise revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way look around you today look around the world if you need any evidence to verify the truth and validity of malcolms statements above and always remember this perceptive observation malcolm makes upon looking back at the intelligence of something he did at the age of all i had done was to improve on their strategy and it was the beginning of a very important lesson in my lifethat anytime you find someone more successful than you are especially when youre both engaged in the same businessyou know theyre doing something that you arent fanon demystified said to put africa in motion to cooperate in its organization in its regrouping behind revolutionary principles to participate in the ordered movement of a continentthis was really the work i had chosen understanding africa there to include african societies wherever they may be that too was malcolms spirit it is reoccurring in many of us today because there are memories between us deeper than grief there are feelings between us much stronger than the cold enemy machine that breaks the back there are places between us deeper than the ocean no distances the reoccurrence of malcolms spirit is the source of our power the power of the best possible productive uses of our lives the ingredients are simple i have written elsewhere more steps towards our freedom and have always been there within reach selfrespect you cannot do anything of real human value unless you respect yourself and your family all the brothers and sisters around the world dedication and commitment to reshaping our lives even our literature and the rest of the arts have to be must be committed and committing the undesirable and the meaningless we will destroy belief with clarity unless you believe in possibility possibility is what always moves usunless you believe that you can actually do something you cannot do it and with our memory pried open to the bone of feeling in the stillnesses of the night we see the gaping wounds where those murderers butchered your flesh as they butchered the flesh of our land spirit to spirit we hear you then blood on blood comes the pledge swift as image in spirit and blood the sons and daughters of our beginnings boldly move to postwhite fearlessness their sharpnesses at the murderers throat as salaam alaikum black roadblocks to black unity by dr alvin f poussaint and linda r mc lean he emergence of the black_power slogan in j june heralded e a new period in the philosophy of civil_rights organizations since then numerous allblack groups have formed throughout america these groups have sprung up not only in the black community but within previously integrated institutions thus we have black caucuses within religious and political organizations afroamerican societies formed on predominantly white college campuses an afro american teachers association and a black social workers association etc there are also various black economic and business organizations being formed these new groups are mushrooming at such a rapid rate that it is almost impossible to keep track of them or to adequately chronicle their formation this new drive for black unity solidarity represents a profound and significant new dimension of the racial struggle in america the formation of allblack political and social action organizations in the black communities is a relatively new phenomenon because of historical impediments both legal and extralegal which existed and which succeeded in promoting black fragmentation and group weakness for example during slavery blacks were disorganized and weakened as a group through the breakup of families and through the displacement and destruction of african culture and history to maintain control and to keep down rebellions whites forbade slaves from gathering together in significant numbers for meetings although group gatherings for religious worship were sometimes allowed by the slave master blacks were prevented from becoming literate so that they could not read and chronicle their experiences grievances and plans in any organized fashion more important however were the many psychological barriers and scars which prevented black organization especially if such organization was met with white disapproval the plantation system in itself implanted a dependency in the minds and behavior of the black man which was inimical to leadership it also prevented blacks from acquiring the skills of administration and control which are necessary for independence and success that is most of the slaves needsfinancial social and personalwere provided for by the master in this connection not only did the black man not have a chance to gain these skills he also never acquired feelings of competency in running things by himself child psychologists know that an important developmental task for youngsters is to have them do things independently in order to gain confidence in their ability to succeed overprotected children whose parents do everything for them often suffer from a lack of feelings of competency thus they often may not feel capable of undertaking projects on their own in addition slaves had limited opportunities to follow the leadership of other assertive and challenging blacks in a successful enterprise most black leadership as in slave revolts ended in failure which was negatively reinforcing blacks were encouraged to follow docile acceptable and whiteapproved leaders assertive systemchallenging blacks have always been feared by whites the racist elements in our society have systematically eliminated often with violence and murder blacks who were nonacquiescent or considered uppity niggers thus the types of skills necessary to satisfy the needs of ones own group which other ethnic groups acquired were never well developed in the black community and as a result blacks became dependent after slavery there was a void in the experiences of black people as well as psychological distrust of other blacks and their abilities to form successful organizations and to provide leadership black people had learned that white was right white was successful all around them and blacks were subservient for example blacks did not have to establish selfhelp organizations because the white boss provided for them the freedmens bureau like a benevolent father sought to take care of the black mans needs the presentday welfare system perpetuates this dependency blacks did not develop business associations of significance because the primary business among black people was the selling of their labor and the business end of such ventures was run by white men blacks were given their religion their language and their culture in addition since the large businesses corporations and industrial enterprises not only in america but in all of the industrialized western world were run by whites and evaluated as being better than nonindustrialized societies blacks had to feel that whites were more successful and capable in this area this lack of opportunity for black people to exercise control and independence has often left a void in the collective black psyche examples of blacks thirst for authority and leadership can be seen in a variety of work and religious situations slaves were preoccupied with imitating their masters and with giving orders this phenomenon was observed in nazi concentration camps and has been noted among groups which are kept subservient the opening scene in the movie gone with the wind shows a black field hand yelling quittin time immediately another slave says youre not supposed to say quittin time im supposed to say it whereupon he proceeds to call out the order himself as this scene exemplifies such small amounts of power were so important that slaves could seriously fight for a modicum of authority house servants felt superior to field hands because their work was inside where they ran the kitchen they took care of the household and they had responsibility even if it was under supervision in religious groups from slavery times to the present there has been a great deal of emphasis placed on positions offices and authority churches which were the only legitimate black organizations to which slaves could belong had ministers deacons elders ushers and all sorts of petty officers today we can see this emphasis on positions in black groups in fact black social and religious groups are frequently plagued by internal discord petty bickering distrust and jealousies among the membership the formality and organization within some black groups make one think that often more emphasis is placed on form than on function and on rules than on programs therefore in understanding present black organizations two things must be brought to the forefront black people suffered from a deficit of experiences in organizing running things successfully and exerting power black people never had much of a chance to follow other black leaders in succesful enterprises rather they saw whites as the successful leaders businessmen and politicians and were always led by them the brief experiences of black men in politics during reconstruction were shortlived and sorely maligned in history afterwards as being corrupt inept ignorant and disastrous consequently although blacks abilities in working cooking and taking care of children were recognized they were never allowed to be in charge today blacks can cook in restaurants but they do not own and run them until recently they could provide entertainment but not own record companies radio stations or have their own television programs they could design clothes shoes hats for someone else but not produce and manufacture them in the old tradition they gave or sold their services but never capitalized on them and organized them for their own gains an awareness of this black experience which historically has overwhelmingly witnessed white leadership is very important when seeking to understand the internal problems which plague black organizations today in previous papers it was suggested that black civil_rights workers blamed the presence of whites for the failure of these groups to accomplish more in terms of programs and change however after the whites left the problems of group organization and effectiveness remained the types of problems and handicaps which exist in the operations of many allblack groups make it amazing and commendable that so much has been accomplished by them the fact that despite a multitude of handicaps black people have seen the need and expressed the desire to organize testifies to their fortitude perseverence flexibility and determination it is hoped that the documentation of these typical dysfunctional and counterproductive mechanisms will enable such groups to identify and to eliminate barriers to their successful operations some of these phenomena have been identified as disruptive to the smooth functioning of any group these factors can be found in the vast sociological and psychological literature on the formation and functioning of groups and group dynamics other problems appear to be endemic to negro groups we have already mentioned a deficit in organizational and leadership skills which originally handicaps black groups second we have pointed to the lack of successful black leadership models in the past from this tradition has emerged a very serious problem of which many leaders of many black groups are probably aware this is the basic distrust and lack of confidence which many blacks have in black leadership because of projected feelings of selfhatred and inferiority black leaders have often found it difficult to get other black people to follow them it seems as though a lot of black people distrust the intentions and abilities of any black person who tries to lead a group comments such as who does he think he is and he dont know nothin are typically directed towards a potential organizer blacks have seen white success and black failure all of their lives they thus question the skills as well as the motives of a person trying to lead them they have been betrayed by blacks who have soldout or sold them down the river therefore they often wonder whats in it for him along with the basic distrust are the more serious selfhatred feelings many blacks shudder at having to do with any organization that is allblack black symbolizes inferiority allblack groups signify an imposed forced segregation which blacks have fought against all of their lives some negro leaders can see no good inand will have nothing to do withallblack groups because they see these as further institutionalizing segregation and legitimizing inferiority thus to them anything allblack has to be stigmatized and inferior this question has many ramifications that do not permit adequate discussion here are all black institutions and situations inherently inferior is inferiority or pathology inherent in the fact that a group or institution is allblack or is it a matter of how they got to be allblack most black institutions have arisen out of a forced segregation and oppression and so tend to be inferior if the oppression is lifted it is quite conceivable that an allblack school or community could be of high quality because many blacks may shun anything that is allblack or any group that is led by a black person we see this selfhatred becoming counterproductive to black organizations dynamically a person says black is inferior i hate myself because i am black and therefore inferior this group of allblacks is inferior so i hate it and will not work with it or destroy itthis strong feeling against black leaders and the preference for white leaders is so prevalent that many major black organizations have white men at the heads trustees governing boards etc it is almost ludicrous to think of a black person leading the american jewish congress bnai brith or the united jewish appeal in fact you would not even find a gentile in this position it is ridiculous to think of a caucasian or a black heading the chinese businessmens association or a nonethnic member being president of an irish or italian group however it has been very typical to see whites as leaders and board members of major black organizations there is nothing wrong with having white persons as members of black organizations however there is a big difference between having white members of predominantly black organizations and having whites as leaders and policymakers of these organizations another factor which plagues black organizations once they are establishedalthough this is also a factor that is disruptive when it occurs in any groupis the cathartic needs and domineering attitudes of some of their members anyone who has attended meetings of some black organizations is familiar with the type of person who demonstrates a profound need to speak out to get angry to show how bad and militant he is and who monopolizes the time of the group by dominating and intimidating other group members this type of behavior probably is prevalent because blacks have had the opportunity to openly and publicly express their anger and hatred towards whites this behavior is often exaggerated by the excessive use of profane language and personal threats which such individuals direct towards other members this may serve an important function in satisfying the personal needs of some group members however often this type of behavior prevents programs from being formed and remedies carried out while these persons may satisfy their own needs to sound off many times they become fixated at this point and cannot move on to more productive behavior since such behavior is destructive to the group it may be a manifestation of selfhatred feelings displaced to the allblack group thus these persons present roadblocks because not only do they take up valuable time they also prevent others from saying or doing anything constructive this type of behavior has interesting psychiatric psychological bases roots the excessive nature of these outbursts and the inappropriate emotions and affect associated with their delivery in part stem from repressed rage and unexpressed anger many of the individuals who are attracted to a group meeting walk around without expressing their anger towards white people and their rage at being oppressed thus when given a safe forum such as the confines of an allblack meeting their release of pentup frustrations is like the bursting of a dam there is another very important phenomenon seen in the behavior of some leaders of black organizations which has a devastating effect on the credibility of these leaders and on their ability to attract a following many of the most militantsounding antiwhite talking young men contradict all they say in action by dating white girls or militant black women date white men it is obvious that the talk of black pride and unity of how black is beautiful and how beautiful it is to be black and of how white people are racists ring hollow when the same person who attempts to influence the populace is seen dating the enemy so to speak this behavior suggests that such a militant is caught up in a reaction formation when he becomes militantly black but he really believes white is right the main problem with this behavior for the effective functioning of black organizations is that it tends to fragment groups and weaken a leaders ability to be convincing the followers see this leader through his actions as being hypocritical dishonest or just messed up therefore he cuts down on his leadership potential still another occurrence which often drastically undercuts the smooth operations of some black organizations involves the tremendous status needs which many members and leaders have the personal desire for individual attention and recognition which many of these individuals demonstrate in their behavior and the tendency to build personality cults rather than strong organizations lead to severe competition discord and antagonism as well as neglect of group goals for example the tremendous needs for personal glory and adulation both within and outside the group which individuals have lead many persons in black organizations to be stubborn obstinate intractible and unyielding in their attitudes opinions and positions they often may refuse to cooperate on group projects to compromise their ideas or positions or to think in terms of what is best for the group or the goals of an organization rather than what will bring selfaggrandizement such needs for status in blacks may stem from basic feelings of worthlessness and inferiority because they are blacks in a white racist society therefore a large proportion of time and energy is expended and wasted fighting personal battles and being preoccupied with petty behavior this very often sabotages the programs of organizations creates personality camps hardens feelings and causes a breakdown in effective programming and operations we have discussed six major problems which typically plague black organizations and which hamper their effective operations in addition to internal factors however there are external pressures which impede the success of allblack organizations one such external factor is the lack of financial support which is given to black organizations by other blacksespecially the black middle class along with the abhorence of things allblack and the pursuit of things allwhite goes much of the black middleclass financial support many middleclass blacks will support white charitable organizations financially however few of them will provide financial support to mostlyblack groups such as the black muslims core or even sclc and the naacp the dynamics and motivations involved here are complex although interesting for some blacks the ability to give money to white groups allows them to gain acceptance and to participate and feel like everybody else some blacks do not see allblack groups as worthwhile in addition to support them forces them to recognize that there is a need for a separate black organization and that there may be problems which pertain solely to them as blacks because of racism this may force them to acknowledge that all is not well and that they are not really accepted on the basis of their individual merits and accomplishments this phenomenon of nonsupport is seen even among verbal militants as one black spokesman said there are lots of cats walking around with natural hair and processed minds thus some individuals who advance their black identity verbally and visibly never put their money where their mouths are in the final analysis it has been white money which has provided the major financial support for civil_rights organizations in the program area black organizations many times experience difficulty in defining their problems discreetly and setting realistic goals because of the overwhelming number of problems which black people face in american society and the pervasiveness and interrelatedness of multiple problems it is often difficult to define problems and to set realistic goals a group very often defines its problems too broadly sets out to solve all of the ills of black people in society and consequently ends up entirely frustrated and discouraged instead of deciding for example to tackle the one area such as employment or particular industries which discriminate or to work on educational barriers or particular school problems a group may decide that it wants to end discrimination in jobs housing and education it may decide to gain jobs housing and freedom now this global definition of goals is unpenetrable and therefore frustrating if a group does not isolate a by harold w cruse from julian j tt v mayfields challenge to my bestseller the crisis of the negro intellectual it is revealed that his feelings have been deeply lashed he speculates with grief that if i had become rich and famous we might have been spared this spiteful book at the beginning of his challenge he asserts that when he picked up my book which began with such promise he had great expectations for reading a work of criticism an area in which we have not yet achieved distinction however after reading it he regrets the painful necessity of having to report that the crisis is a glaring failure and worse its good he knows we lack critical distinction in passing to the meat of his challenge he says that the book will be a brisk seller especially on college campuses despite the expensive price it was at this crucial point that i began to hurt badly because he is misquoting my price which is downright unethical of himimagine cutting into my campus sales like that i am indignant the real price is which is a way of avoiding saying and change as a result of this unfair trade practice of misquoting my sellout price to the campus establishment i am in more fiscal pain than is mayfield in critical discomfiture of course mayfield need not have pained himself into his sorrowful decision of putting down my book as an unmitigated failure i would rather he did it with gleeful chuckles inspired by the certain knowledge that he had killed all possible brisk sales off the campuses if not on but alas alack mayfield suspects otherwise painfully and so he wishes the book had never been written and the issues in the book had never been reused in such a painful way but how does one raise painful issues without pain i commiserate with mayfields politically thin skin criticism on the issues especially those he didnt discuss are indeed a hard school and mr mayfield has not been accustomed to this sort of thing although he and i are products of the same political tradition we came from different sides of the railroad tracks in a manner of speaking unlike myself mayfield never received critical assaults before because he never raised any critical issues while in the communist left i can boast of a long record of raising issues in the communist left and getting raked for it while mayfield and his friends were conforming and performing for their privileges it is these friends of his that he unconsciously refers to when he wishes that we might have been spared my spiteful book also negro digest readers should not believe that mayfield really expected anything from my book but what he got he knew what to expect because its a cinch he had already been told our mutual animosity and divergence of views had been established as far back as and in an article on the communist left which i published in the studies on the left inspired mayfield to write john henrik clarke a letter containing the statement that cruse ought to be lynched at least that was the way clarke relayed it to me verbally mind you there was nothing about mayfields personal commitments mentioned in that article still from way over there in ghana mayfield bristled like an angry rooster in the red barnyard yet when it comes to a discussion of the issues raised in my bestseller he acts like an intellectual chicken hiding his thin skin behind a cackling barrage of barnyard gossip but this has always been characteristic of the colored section of the communist left which included a dull collection of intellectual yesmen yeahwomen yea sayers and trained apologists for communist party irrelevancies on black reality nothing unsettled them and made them bristle selfrighteously more than a threat of criticism all through my communist career and even after all that i ever got from the likes of richard b moore hope stevens lorraine hansberry and her freedom newspaper circle and other lesser bureaucrats of negro marxiana was the intolerance and exclusiveness of cliques the arrogance of a privileged caste the closedminded rigidity of a bureaucracy whose status was predicated not on anything politically creative but on a hackneyed political line dating back to the s these are the we for whose feelings mayfield is hurting ever since mayfield first arrived belatedly in he has tried mightily for the role of a frontrunner like one very ambitious to star in the eyes of his more experienced colleagues that he was the first to answer my book with a written dissent is typical of mayfield the frontrunner yet of all the individuals who are mentioned in my book mayfield is by all odds among the least knowledgeable and experienced he cant give the otherside of very much that happened in harlem for the simple reason that he came too late and wasnt around very long after this is the real reason he cant discuss issues it is not because of my distortions it is because mayfield doesnt know very much he is not a harlemite and knows next to nothing about harlem communist party happenings from to because by his own admission he didnt graduate from high school until in washington dc after that he went into the army and to college in he took up theater and got a role in the andersonweill production of lost in the stars which did not close until late or early by the time he arrived in harlem the main fireworks of were over even then his participation was marginal to the fundamental political and cultural issues that had been argued out and fought over by the postwar younger wave of communists after a brief stint with the committee for the negro in the arts freedom newspaper the harlem writers guild and some play productions mayfield was off to puerto rico where he remained the greater part of the s it was from puerto rico that he published his first novels which were peddled for him by someone else in the meantime i and others had to uphold his right to go to puerto rico against the snide criticism of some downtown white communists who charged mayfield with running out i vocally upheld his privilege of leaving the country even though i hardly knew him personally despite my dislike for indulging in personal issues in what is purported to be an exchange of critical opinions on political and cultural issues one must often descend to such tactics when mayfield asserts that the victims of my destructive thrust are not the valid ones of wrong obsolete and untenable ideas and attitudes but a long list of artists and intellectuals many of them dead whom mr cruse happens not to like he is absolutely rightthat is in part a few of them i definitely did not like at all others i had no personal rancor against but simply didnt think much of their work or their intellectual stature for example i think both langston hughes and loften mitchell were real nice guys whom i liked an awful lot i simply think however that a lot of langston hughes work poetry excepted was simply sloppy simplistic unpolished and of generally deteriorating quality from the s onwards i dont believe loften mitchell one of my best friends reached any real expertise as a playwright everybody raved about john o killens youngblood however i personally found it impossible to finish this novel because it had absolutely no style in the writing and reflected a social point of view which was for me naive and oversimplistic and sociologically superficial in addition to this killens has an inflated ego which is not justified in the real light of his work i considered killens war novel and then we heard the thunder his best work but also predicted that when killens would be forced to depart from autobiographical material for his thematic ideas he would lapse his last novel sippi proves this for me it is a failure an embarrassing flop which didnt surprise me at all perhaps killens will prove for me that he can write a good nonautobiographical novel but i doubt it these doubts are based not so much on personal feelings as they are on what i perceive in the novelists social outlook which is highly egostistical but often corny and also limited in terms of social perceptions on the blackwhite thing when such an outlook is also permeated with leftwing ideology it is not a point of view that is amenable to much perception in the handling of human materials this becomes a critical and cultural problem of no mean proportions let us discuss miss lorraine hansberry and the freedom newspaper episodes mayfield mentions he complains that i mention her name more than i do web du bois i mentioned mayfields name less than either of them but he is screaming the most in pain mayfield refuses to accept my stated premise for writing my book i made it more than clear in the first pages that i was about to critically dissect the role of the black creative and professional intellectual beginning with james baldwin and his contemporaries in the course of the book i also dealt with some of the historical antecedents that have influenced these contemporary creative intellectuals naturally i deal most thoroughly with those whom i have known personally more or less before mayfield arrived at freedom newspaper i met miss hansberry there mayfield from his marginal contact with harlem realities wonders what was i doing in freedoms office well long before mr mayfield arrived i had been to freedoms office with the proposal that in addition to writing for that journal i would also see that paul robesons paper got distributed to all the harlem newsstands along lenox and seventh avenues this kind of work it may be noted was not the kind of work the freedom staff nor mayfields friends were at all interested in dirtying their hands with but i am not proud in that respect moreover we postwar harlem communists had been taught the necessity of doing all kinds of unglamorous chores such as street speaking and demonstrating newspaper selling block and house canvassing veterans work tenants work leaflet distributing fund collecting putting dispossessed peoples furniture back in their homes fending off police harassment etc etc this was the side of harlem communist activity mayfield never experienced but inside freedom newspaper office i met lorraine hansberry and found her attitude downright insulting both class and castewise besides that she was demonstrably antimale especially towards those she considered socially beneath her i noticed that eslanda goode robeson hardly ever looked at anyone in freedoms office she didnt personally know robeson himself i found usually morose and uncommunicative in contrast to the public face he usually put up for me who had been with robeson during both peekskill uprisings in and was also one of the personal guards assigned to him after the riots when he made personal appearances in new york this was not an encouraging closeup all in all i grew to dislike the freedom newspaper staff they probably didnt like me either because i was too outspoken for their tastes so the feeling was mutual its been mutual ever since except for robeson i had no respect for their abilities or their leadership pretentions in the journalistic fields i was never impressed with either lorraine hansberrys writing abilities nor her ideas after she became famous aside from personal considerations and attitudes i considered it necessary to say these things in a book of social political literary and cultural criticism all of julian mayfields novels were overrated works and at the age of mayfield has not matured as a novelist these are serious questions that should be critically debated by and for all those seriously concerned with black cultural problems in america mayfield believes that a lot of my harsh judgment stems from my own personal disappointments in the theater and he is absolutely correct but that is only a small part of it my own failures in the theater is nobodys fault but my own inasmuch as i never will write plays or anything else to suit anyones a priori tastes hence the story mayfield tells about my asking lorraine hansberry to read a musical play of mine is an apochryphal yarn that someone told him i never spoke to hansberry but two or three times in on freedom newspaper and never had words with her again in fact i never knew hansberry was even in terested in theater until her play raisin in the sun was produced in i never knew her well enough to ask her anything of that nature i will not go so far as to say that mayfield is lying for effect because it is very obvious that someone from freedoms staff told him this i have been my own harshest critic when it comes to judging my own plays none of them have been good enough to warrant my sustained effort to get them produced more than that all plays soon become dated and one must get on to new ideas my chief gripe about the theater is that we have no theater institution in which to experiment with new play ideas therefore i soon become disinterested not only with what i have written but with the theater generally thus merely to get a play produced was never for me a life and death matter neither was getting rich and famous as mayfield intimates i could have done that too a long time ago by concocting stuff for hollywood at least i had offers this does not mean that i would object to being rich and famous it only means that getting rich and famous must come as a result of the righ creative and critical standards i set for myself as a creative individual as for mayfields moral posturing over my drinking water incident in the cuban hills he reminds me of an old gossiping spinster digging up dirt about her social rivals in an old maids coterie sure i complained about water and vocally some of us came down with severe cases of dysentery from being forced to drink water from impure springs as guests of the cuban government we had every right to complain mayfield however true to political leftwing methods of prosecution of enemies of the revolution blows up this incident into a belligerent threat against the cuban revolution unlike the hansberry allegations which was gossip someone passed on to him this time mayfield concocts a scurrilous lie about what i actually said moreover the person i complained to was no mere aide who spoke no english but the cuban poet pablo armando fernandez it is a pity that this type of political scuttlebutt should enter into this exchange but the reader should note that it is an example of the venom that accumulates in the spate of personal attacks characteristic of communist leftwing polemics i believe leroi jones was present at this completely insignificant incident and i doubt he would corroborate this falsehood while we are on this interesting question of political gossip i have an excellent suggestion for julian mayfieldas a writer of some talent mayfield is missing his own boat in the department of literary originality and sophistication he is keeping his public ignorant of some real juicy bits of scandal simply dripping with human and political er and also cultural interest relating to his short harlem writers club period in new york which also has political and human cultural connections with his glorious sojourn in the puerto rican sunshine durante y bajo el encanto de la amor grande y amorosa pardon my french this idyllic escapade to the caribbean blue surf also carried itself across the great deep to our ancestral sod in ghana i say our only as a sop to african unity cause after all my folks were pure zulu who tell me they never had anything to do with them ghanaians and that i shouldnt associate with them cause they left them white folks enslave them but i dont pay any tention to that garbage cause my folks were rather oldfashioned and conservative im with the new african unity thing now where were we oh yesmayfield with his gift of literary declamation went through that swingin odyssey and aint told us a blessed thing about it now if that har lem writers club only had a black henry miller running their literary workshop instead of john oliver killens man alive that cat would have told us an eroticculturalliterary narrative that would have made henry millers tropics of cancer and capricorn read like a cheap sex novel about sexually deprived white folks stranded on an equatorial island in the pacific trying to negotiate foreign aid programs for the natives now please julian mayfields response te harold cruse here is no need to reply at length to mr cruses pathetic attempt to cut my gums out the level of his attack should make it clear to any sensitive reader that the main thrust of my reviewarticle in which i called into question the authors basic integrity was substantially correct what for example are we to make of a wouldbe political pundit who seems to have filled his notebook with speculation about the sexual lives of people who always avoided him like the plague how are we to regard a man who fancies himself as a latterday frantz fanon but who demands of me that i join him in repeating the scurrilous rumors circulated in the western press about the private life of ghanas president kwame nkrumah mr cruse has never visited ghana nor indeed any other region of africa and his admirers should wonder why he the ultrablack nationalist derives so much satisfaction from an attempt to discredit the most progressive and prophetic leader black africa has ever had this brings us to a serious inadequacy in the authors preparation which is reflected in his work mr cruse has never been anywhere and i certainly understand why he resents those who did leave home the fact that he has as a writer seldom left new york city is not a virtue but a grave liability this accounts for the myopic inference in his book that everything worth mentioning about black intellectuals happened in manhattan thus he largely neglects chicago which has always rivaled new york as a center of black intellectual ferment washington nashville atlanta and lately los angeles are cities where black people are cooking on ideas that may have an even more profound impact on the resolution of the crisis of black intellectualism than atypical new york in such an unlikely place as cleveland there are at least a score of young black intellectuals and artists who are determined one way or the other to build a new city but of these developments mr cruse seems blithely unaware both greyhound and trailways send buses to these cities everyday and one would have thought that his publishers would have advanced him the fare then he might have understood that the intellectual brew stirring in our communities has little resemblance to the situation of those of us associated with the political left in the early postwar period my principal reason for rejecting mr cruse as a critic pundit or seer has nothing to do with anything as irrelevent as his sex life or even the fact that in all his years he has never written or done anything meaningful so that we might judge him by his work it is simply that mr cruse does not know and not knowing should not presume to lead the average young brother and sister in the struggle whether an intellectual or not has never met an american communist yet mr cruse would have them divert their energies to a meaningless struggle that has not had significance since he was a young man in the crisis of the negro intellectual general cruse leads us to the wrong battlefield american disciples of karl marx may have done childe harold wrong but that is harolds hangup now our basic problem is how to survive in and rid ourselves of the most dangerous oppressive and imperialistic power structure the world has ever known mr cruse has a good mind and might be able to help if he did not spend so much time peeping into bedroom keyholes the black student and the brother in the streets by vernon j dixon he call is out to enroll the skills and analytical tools of the black student in furthering and shaping the black revolution in effect this call has been heeded already by those afroamerican students for whom identification with their brothers in the street does not present any difficulty the problem which arises however for these black students is concern for selecting the most viable response the feeling of oneness with his black brethren was clearly evident at an east coast conference of black students a few days after the violent expression of black anger provoked by the assassination of martin_luther_king jr one student stated the strongest feeling of the group when he asked agonizingly my black brothers are getting shot down out there what am i doing here in effect the group was seeking the optimal form to give their identification this question is more specific for the black graduate student he already possesses skills needed in the black community therefore he must compare the benefits of increasing his skills with the costs of foregoing immediate use of these skills in the black community thus for a significant number of black university and college students the prime concern is how to relate to the brothers in the street unfortunately to a large extent the process of analyzing the question occurs within an academic and social structure erected on the white american experience by definition in such an environment the black student does not find any major institutional support for his evolving black consciousness awareness acceptance articulation and development of the black experience so vital to completing the framework for resolving the question while the particular answer to this question will reflect the individuality of the black student it occurs to me that it is crucial that he understand clearly how american values are influencing him as h rap brown has said its whats in your head not whats on your head this point cannot be stressed too strongly in any theory or model which the black student develops in any policy recommendation which he derives from that theory and in concrete action which he undertakes based on that policy american values determine the very structure and direction of this process of postulation theorizing policy formulation and concrete implementation this paper explores the mind set of american values and how it may affect the choice of the black student in determining his mode of interaction with the brother in the street to unravel and to comprehend fully the operation of the american value construct requires a thirdeye view ie the black student must exercise his analytical ability to transcend his mind set this is necessary because members of universities and colleges have implanted deeply in his mind that the essential values of american civilization remain universal and eternal while simultaneously ignoring all the blunders white americans have made the american value matrix which i discuss in this paper consists of advocacy of individualism the apotheosis of the individual advocacy of the literal tradition which is construed to exclude the figurative tradition advocacy of reason rather than emotion as the final arbiter of human affairs k before showing the linkage between these individual values in the american mind set and their effect on the black students selection of a mode of interacting with his brethren i must point out that i am no more arguing for the primacy and universality of the opposites of these values than i am for the values themselves indeed elsewhere i have set forth a way of perceiving and organizing experiences which confirms without inherent tension the copresence of differing value constructs here i want only to examine the american mind set of values so that the black student may become conscious of the way in which it determines how he decides to interact with the brothers in the street thus some unconscious operation may become conscious and therefore offer a greater spectrum of alternatives to the black student in selecting his way of participating in the black revolution the first american value in the mind set which the black student should consider is individualism by this term i mean the apotheosis of the individual which signifies the elevation of the individual to the level of a god there is no conception of the group as a whole except as a collection of individuals each individual is defined exclusively by the way in which he differs from other individuals rather than by the way in which he is similar to them by that definition each individual exists uniquely ie the individual has the godlike properties of oneness and uniqueness in attempting to attain these characteristics the individual is apotheosizing himself individualism in this sense has important implications for the black student as he chooses his lorm of identification with his brothers in the street for example a black student who has used his skills and analytical tools to formulate a theory or to erect a model which incorporates the black experience will often be criticized by his fellow black students to the effect what you have to say is fine and good but will it reach the brother in the street can he dig what you have to say i will discuss later the implications of this remark about the ability of the brothers in the street to comprehend theoretical statements and complex propositions but for the moment i only want to suggest how that remark may reflect individualism which in turn confines the black student the black student who is predisposed towards selfapotheosis knows empirically that individuals have both unique and similar characteristics therefore the black student who desires to validate the primacy of his person must seek confirmation of his selfdeification this may be accomplished by taking his output theories models policies actions directly to the brothers in the street for their approval or disapproval having determined his brothers position the black student converts their approval or disapproval into a measure of his selfapotheosis as a result of this process the output of the black student and his assessment of his own apotheosis have become equivalent it follows that even though the concerns of the brothers in the street are the inputs analyzed by the black student the motivating force of individualism or selfapotheosis demands that his output be directly evaluated by his black brethren in the street however that requirement of direct evaluation severely constrains his output in the absence of individualism the black student is no longer directed towards his own private ends and therefore his analytical ability and skills are not used to produce output for direct evaluation by the brothers in the street models theories policies and actions not previously considered can be undertaken whether useful now or later whether approved or not approved by the brethren that output truly enlarges the spectrum of alternative definitions of the black experience in this context therefore all output derived from the input of black experience furthers the black revolution moreover the student can now allow that output to reach the brothers in the street through the mediation of other brothers without the limitation of individualism the black student has a wider range from which to select his mode of relating to his brothers in the street before discussing the other elements in the american value matrix i think the black student should realize that his concern about reaching the brothers in the street may reflect his desire to receive the adoration of his brethren in this case the black student usually acts out that desire in becoming a leader his output elicits direct approval from the brothers and he in turn has influence over their actions however the black student who seeks that approval in order to assess the primacy of himself is acting within the confines of individualism in effect that approval serves for him as the adoration necessary to confirm his selfapotheosis receiving approval and exerting influence on this basis the black student leads the black revolution along an extremely narrow road of development for a black leader influenced by individualism will not only reject output theories models policies actions from other brothers but he will also restrict the formulation of his own output such a leader will accept another brothers output only when it can be presented as originating with him in this way he seeks to maintain the adoration of the brethren in the street underlying this reaction is the fear that the primacy of his leadership will be weakened if not eliminated all this is consistent with the black leaders selfapotheosis furthermore he will perceive the true concerns of the brethren only when they concur with his own if the black revolution calls for output which will undermine the black leaders selfapotheosis and lessen his adoration he will not be able to hear the call and develop the appropriate output himself as a result this type of leader hinders the black revolution unfortunately the desire for adoration in order to confirm the primacy of self is reinforced and implemented through the other two components of the american value matrix the literal tradition and the superiority of reason the second constituent in the mind set of american values which influences the black student is the advocacy of the literal tradition compared to the figurative tradition in this paper a literal tradition signifies the tendency to construe words oral or written in their denotative sense the importance of this stress on logical clarity is seen in the increasing trend of using mathematical language in various disciplines consequently the black student is trained to express exactly what he means if imagination is viewed as the power to represent the real more fully and truly than it appears to the senses then in figurative language imagination is actually embodied within the words in literal language imagination occurs as a result of the individuals response to the subject matter rather than to the connotation of the words themselves for example there are some white people who still believe that the word brother used among black people signifies a blood relationship compared to the literal tradition the figurative language has marvelous complexity and originality examples of this are constantly produced in current speech to some brothers in the street the words negro and uncle tom while figurative were yet too literal they wanted a word which when contraposed to black would characterize a person as one of color on the outside and white inside and the word would also indicate simultaneously the persons entire position toward the black revolution as one reflecting white racist attitudes toasty the word is a perfect illustration of the figurative tradition the problem for the black student however is the implications of the american mind set which asserts the literal tradition as the superior tradition if the black student accepts uncritically his proficiency in literal language as superior to figurative language he will limit his range of choice in se c lecting modes of relating to the brothers in the street this will occur in two ways through false perceptions of the brethrens ability to comprehend complex propositions and through implementing the motivation of the black student to become an apotheosistic leader concerning the first limiting effect the black student who emphasizes the literal tradition without scrutiny closes avenues of reaching the brothers in the street this student may fail to recognize that the figurative language of the black community contains extraordinarily complex nuances and profound ideas they have not been articulated in the literal form as leroi jones has pointed out when a blind hopeless black preacher says god dont never change a precise thing is being said the preacher does not mean god does not ever change he means exactly god dont never change in terms of the human referent of the black community this is a profound statement on the deterministic order of the world in effect the figurative language of the brother in the street has its own logical clarity there is a failure to perceive this complex system of expression when the black student accepts the literal tradition as the superior one consequently if the complexity in the figurative tradition is not rec w ognized then the ability of the users of that language to comprehend involved propositions is not perceived a broader avenue to discerning the interests of the brothers in the street is closed this may be inferred from the remark of the black students mentioned previously ie what you have to say is fine and good but can the brothers dig it to such black students complex ideas can not reach the brothers in the street because the brethren are not capable of understanding them all propositions must be simple so they can dig what you say it follows that no attempt is made to explore systematically the figurative tradition of the brothers in the street in order to preserve to enrich and to develop the strengths of that tradition and to communicate figuratively to the brethren their meaning for black identity the second way in which acceptance of the superiority of the literal tradition limits modes of relating is through implementing the tendency of the black student to become a leader in order to achieve his own apotheosis since the black student is conversant with both languages the literal group requires him to serve as their translator of the figurative tradition it is quite easy for the black student to use literal language as a tool to prove to the literal group that only he can interpret to them the concerns of the brothers in the street should this student be motivated at the same time by selfapotheosis it follows for him that only he can lead the brethren moreover in relating to the figurative group such a leader will use the literal language to falsely discredit any challenges to his selfapotheosis he demands that the threatening brother in the street state his ideas in literal form define your terms and say exactly what you mean during the time this type of leader is functioning through language manipulation he hinders development of the black revolution since he cannot recognize the ability of the brethren to comprehend complex propositions such a leader can neither perceive nor translate the true concerns of the black community if at any time he does so it will be fortuitous and not the result of communication with the group additionally he cannot communicate with the brethren on a complex figurative level thereby being unable in a broad sense to perform an educational role thus a black student who seeks selfdeified leadership has at best a narrow range of approaches to interacting with his brothers these avenues of communication are not widened by the influence of the third element in the mind set of american values the stress on reason over and against emotion the advocation of reason as the final arbiter in human affairs together with the two preceding components of the value matrix reduce alternative forms of identification before the black student can see this linkage he must recognize the connection between the process of reasoning and the process of administrationthe latter being a common way in which a black student relates to his brethren reason in one sense signifies the capacity to extract implications from a combination of facts or suppositionsthe power of comprehending and inferring inherent in this process is that particular act of transcending the apparent meaning of the combination in order to comprehend and infer a further meaning which was not immediately apparent this act i have termed overviewing an administrator performs this same function of overviewing when he coordinates activity to accomplish some common purpose if reasoning is viewed as superior it is very easy to transfer this same superiority to the process of administration indeed to an administrator motivated by selfapotheosis the act of overviewing can be interpreted by him as evidence of his primacy moreover inherent in the administrative process is the discretionary power to select based on his overview the optimal way of achieving a common goal to a selfapotheosistic administrator the way chosen must be optimal for the true concerns of the group in effect this type of black administrator like the corresponding leader causes the same harm that results from a narrow range of approaches to interacting with the brother in the street unfortunately this harm is increased when such an administrator also accepts the literal tradition as the superior one on one side this type of administrator cannot recognize ideas expressed figuratively on the other side the brother in the street cannot express these ideas literally therefore a selfapotheosistic black administrator cannot overview the true interests of the brethren and he probably will not select the optimal approach to their attainment consequently in becoming an administrator or a leader the black student selects as his form of identification one which can be most destructive to the black revolution if it is determined by the entire american value matrix it is now clear that this mind set of values reduces the alternatives open to the black student the implications for the student who transcends that mind set are too numerous to be exhausted here the black community will offer him many opportunities which have not yet been realized in turn this may lead him to formulate new postulates theories policies and actions if he approaches the black community unhandicapped he may discover such strengths as nonindividualistic concern for communal interests the institution of the extended family and rich cultural forms of which the figurative tradition is only one instance these may stimulate him to develop meaningful output which will preserve those strengths without transforming them into a new value matrix which is advocated as universal and eternal the black student who becomes a leader or an administrator could then regard himself as a man of the hour one who is entrusted temporarily with the implementation of the brethrens interest but who also generates his own replacement by the appropriate means thus the wider range of alternatives available to the black student provide greater potentiality for a successful black revolution by pfumo dzvuku n may the united nations security council unanimously passed a britishsponsored resolution enjoining all members of the un to impose total trade and economic sanctions against southern rhodesia the resolution was only the latest of several others adopted by various organs of the world organization against the rebellious british colony in which white settlers have carved a cosy niche for themselves by suppressing nearly african inhabitants of the country on last june the british house of lords defeated its own governments orderincouncil seeking to validate the un sanctions program at this writing the labor government of prime minister harold wilson was reported preparing another order which it was expected would be adopted by both houses of the british parliament what it may be asked do these developments mean what in fact is the essence of the rhodesian problem and how effectively may we expect international action to help resolve it there are two important factors underlying the whole rhodesia problem which deserve more attention than has been given them in all the diplomatic manoeuvring at the un and in all the innumerable commentaries that have been written on the issue failure to analyse and articulate these factors has led to a lot of wishful thinking and the flourishing of rampant hypocrisy the two most important factors underlying the rhodesian problem relate to the countrys position as an integral part of the geopolitics of southern africa and to the role of britain itself in the emergence and consolidation of minority settler hegemony in that unhappy country rhodesia has developed historically as an extension of south africa culminating with the present situation in which she has become a south african satellite as for britain her role has consisted in condoning and encouraging the processes whereby rhodesia has become a pocketsize south africa taking these factors into account and having regard to the western worlds massive and abiding support of south africa the un sanctions against rhodesia cannot but prove hollow and pathetically futile they cannot succeed because they have been formulated on the erroneous assumption that rhodesia can be totally quarantined and left to suffocate slowly to death but this cannot be done because rhodesiadue to economic diplomatic and racial factorsprobably can boast richer and more reliable friends than any african country she certainly cannot be economically ruined let alone starved to death by the kind of resolution that the un recently passed rhodesias links with south africa date back to the countrys colonization towards the end of the th century that colonization was spearheaded by arch empirebuilder cecil rhodes a british african tycoon and onetime prime minister of the cape colony now cape province of south africa by use of trickery and armed might the country was won for the british empire in the band of marauders used for this purpose were hired in south africa at rhodes own expense despite their determined and heroic resistance particularly between and the africans of zimbabwe the countrys proper name were finally subdued and foreign rule firmly installed from that time on rhodesia developed virtually as an appendage of south africa roads railroads communication lines etc were established linking the country with south africa moreover south africa supplied most of the new colonys needs of imported capital and consumer goods of various kinds in addition to this rhodesia provided a convenient haven for any spillover of south africas white population so that as of today well over percent of the settler population of rhodesia is of south african origin as might be expected the effect of these developments was that rhodesias economic political and social institutions and practices emerged basically as faithful replicas of south african patterns and practices not surprisingly therefore all the ugly features of south african apartheid have come to have very close parallels in rhodesiaexpropriation of african land over percent of the total land area being reserved for current and future european use rigid separation of the races territorially socially etc imposition of the most oppressive and humiliating codes of law on the african majority including pass laws curfew regulations in urban areas constant police surveillance and harassment the denial of meaningful political rights to africans has been the central tenet of settler rule and this has never been seriously questioned even by the most liberal settler politicians thus africans have been denied the vote through the imposition of various qualifications which are carefully and cynically trimmed to include all whites and to exclude all but a token number of blacks open political organization among africans has virtually been proscribed on a permanent basis between and five major african political parties were banned and hundreds of their leaders and followers placed in jail and concentration camps without trial and in most cases for indefinite periods it may be noted here that throughout this period britain as the imperial power with overall responsibility for the destiny of the colony never once lifted a finger against the perpetration of these outrages by her immigrant nationals indeed successive british governments extended greater powers to the settlers whenever the latter sought to broaden their stranglehold on the country thus for example in rhodesia was granted socalled responsible selfgovernment in she was allowed to pass the iniquitous land apportionment act which is the sheetanchor of the racist structure of the country in rhodesian settlers conspired with those in the then northern rhodesia now zambia and the then nyasaland now malawi to concoct the central african federation despite african opposition in britain in league with the settlers imposed a thoroughly undemocratic constitution on rhodesia in spite of vehement african opposition to the scheme and when the un at the initiative of ghana tried in to pass a resolution barring rhodesia from acquiring the military equipment of the defunct central african federation britain vetoed that particular resolution it is unnecessary to illustrate further the accuracy and validity of our original contention that rhodesia developed as a miniature south africa and that she was aided and abetted in this process by the same british government which today pretends quite hypocritically to be leading the sanctions war against that country the extent of south african involvement has not of course been limited to the general politicoideological influences of the sort we have alluded to since the illegal declaration of independence by the ian smith regime south africa has moved in to stabilize and bolster the rhodesian economy trade between the two countries has increased phenomenally rhodesia has been offered convenient credit facilities for the purchase inor through south africa of essential commodities and weapons of war for the suppression of the african liberation forces inside rhodesia south africa has facilitated the process whereby rhodesia has been able to continue trading with the rest of the world by the device of setting up dummy companies in south africa which then channel goods to and from rhodesia the point about all this is that south africa has a vital interest in the situation in rhodesia she obviously calculates that the fall of rhodesia would bring the forces of african liberation to her own doorsteps and will therefore fight to prevent this eventuality above all south africa realizes that the fall of a regime founded on the same racist principles as herself would have a profound moral and psychological effect on south africa conversely the endurance of the rhodesian regime can be expected to bolster the morale of the south african racists and to ensure the security of south africas northern frontiers these considerations have therefore impelled south africa to actively support the rhodesia settler dictatorship economically diplomatically and militarily elements of the south african army air force and police force are presently serving in rhodesia against zimbabwe guerrilla forces taking these factors into account to suppose that south africa might abandon rhodesia would be laughable were it not also a tragic form of selfdeception south africa cannot now nor ever will abandon rhodesia unless the military costs to her become excessively unbearable our analysis thus points to the inescapable conclusion that un sanctions against rhodesia can only have at the very most an extremely peripheral effect on the total situation the sanctions could conceivably produce a dent on the props of the rhodesian economy were they also to be applied against south africa which country after all at the very minimum richly deserves that treatment but it would be naive even to dream that the un could take action of a radical nature against south africa after all that countrys best friends the usa britain and france are blessed with oermanent seats a on the un security council just to ensure no gaps are left unplugged despite these and other western countries eloquent and colorful oratory denouncing apartheid we can expect their active involvement in the gilded muck of the south african situation to con ft tinue or even to grow apace the most we can expect of collective international action against the modern hitlers of south africa are lots of wordy resolutions liberally larded with gratuitous free world advice cautioning against precipitous and irresponsible action against the criminal perpetrators of apartheid this type of preachy and condescending paternalism has almost become routine at the un it becomes clear from the foregoing that the vote of the house of lords in support of ian smith referred to at the start of this article cannot be treated as the impulsive act of a few oldfashioned british imperialist peers that vote represented widelylaid sympathies for rhodesia among virtually all significant sectors of british public opinion including the governing labor party itself the only real difference between mr wilson and his baronial opponents is that the latter have tactlessly and needlessly exposed britain instead of sensibly coating the pill of anglorhodesian collusion with the sugar of all the sweet talk about fairplay etc the position adopted by the british lords after all been given open and nearfanatical expression to by no less a personage than former u s secretary of state dean acheson see washington post dec as an example acheson cloaks his support for the rhodesian settlers in pseudolegalistic terms arguing with ridiculous abandon that to impose sanctions against rhodesia is a contravention of the un charter on the basis of this puerile legalistic nonsense acheson evidently hopes to have the u s openly recognize and support the rhodesian settler dictatorship thus far from lacking friends abroad rhodesia probably has a surfeit of these at all levels we are not even including such groups as the birchites etc in view of the foregoing factors it would have been suicidal for zimbabwe africans to have placed any hopes on the un to help their liberation every indication points to the inescapable fact that the initiative and responsibility for effecting that liberation must lie with the zimbabweans themselves while they may receive support from abroad such support can only be complimentary to their own efforts this is not to decry outside help by any means for such help is certainly needed in view of the formidable forces against which zimbabwe freedom fighters are ranged but external support cannot constitute the decisive element here no doubt zimbabweans will triumph over their internationallysupported oppressors when the hour of reckoning arrives however we shall all be the wiser for having travelled through the current difficulties and thus being enabled to see who were our true friends and who our bitter enemies that lesson cannot be lost upon the present generation of zimbabweans she lit a candle one man in his time plays many parts shakespeare wrote but not many women have assumed and carried off many parts with such vibrancy and fortitude as has ida l jackson even in her native vicksburg mississippi miss jacksons eyes were always on the goal that if she had the best in education herself she could better educate others there she attended rust college and new orleans college now dillard university when the family moved to oakland california she enrolled at the university of california at berkeley and obtained her ab degree ma degree and her administrative credentials she became the first black woman to teach in a public high school ida l jackson in california imperial valley and was the first black teacher in the oakland california public school systemand the only one for years she organized the first black sorority on the pacific coast rho chapter at the university of california in miss jackson attended a choir concert composed of young singers from the cotton fields of mississippi the lecturer accompanying them described the abject poverty and squalor of the black tenant farmers life in rural mississipp not only were there few educational opportunities but unending poverty with its accompanying ramshackle housing containing neither plumbing nor lights and a plantation system that bordered on serfdom had left the people dehumanized and defeated hearing of these bleak and grim conditions rekindled an idea miss jackson had long held that educated professional black people should take the initiative in helping the less fortunate of the race if they were to be reached at all she felt the wav to better conditions at that time was to conduct a summer school for rural black teachers illiterate adults and children endowed with the noblest of all emotionsenthusiasm and dripping with go she immediately sought help from others of like mind and using her own funds she scheduled the first summer school for six weeks in at the school in lexington mississippi for which the cotton field singers had been concertizing to raise funds however before the six weeks were over it was evident that the overwhelming need was for health care and health education in lexington and the surrounding rural country disease and poverty were rampant among families whose median income was a year some of the teachers and pupils attending the summer school would get up at am to work in the fields before walking three seven and eight miles to school but those not suffering from contagious diseases pellagra syphilis were nutritionally starved from an unbroken diet of the msmeat meal and molasses the nittygritty need wasnt education but immediate health care more convinced than ever that the educated and trained black individual had a responsibility to take the lead in alleviating the grinding poverty of the less fortunate and having become national president of her sorority alpha kappa alpha she proposed to her sorors the idea of a health clinic at lexington after initiating and completing plans for this and after persuading the membership to vote the funds she found doctors to participate and interested other members in voluntarily helping during their summer vacations the plans to set up a permanent health clinic at lexington immediately ran into a period of sturm und drang from white plantation owners always fearful of outside agitators they would not allow the blacks to leave the plantations to attend the clinic it became necessary to reorganize the clinic and to take the services to the plantations and carry on under the watchful eyes of the overseers this innovation was a firsttime use of mobile health clinics and it proved to be best for this first year as more people were reached in isolated areas who would not have been able to come to a central clinic even with the consent of the plantation boss most of the blacks had never had any medical attention and eagerly attended the clinics many had never seen a black woman doctor or dentist and they felt proud that their own race was trying to help them for eight summers doctors nurses teachers and dentists from the sorority membership volunteered each summer to take health services to areas not previously visited over these years children were immunized against diphtheria and smallpox thousands of adults were treated for malaria syphilis and dental needs each child received a new toothbrush and instructions in its use expectant mothers and children with rickets were provided with protective food concentrates a trailer kitchen was added to educate the sharecropper families to plant kitchen gardens to vary their m diets in the first summer of operation the mobile caravan covered over miles leaving behind less misery illness relief and hope the earlier attitude of hostility from plantation owners changed to one of cooperation and welcome the second summer the clinic was shifted to bolivar county distinguished at that time by the fact that no insurance company would issue policies to its residents because of the poor health conditions and the high sickness rate the white health officer of the county welcomed the clinic and helped the sorority to establish a permanent base at the allblack town of mound bayou he also helped to advertise the clinic by having circulars printed contacting plantation owners and ministers and posting notices at one twoday session over patients attended the results in bolivar county where the population was almost threequarters black was that the residents became healthconscious and the clinics were crowded a black fraternal order which was planning to build an office building in mound bayou changed its plans and built a modern bcd hospital the first and only one for blacks in the county at the end of each summer session of the clinic the county continued the malaria and syphilis treatments with drugs donatcu by the sorority as a demonstration project the purpose of which was to arouse official agencies to the pressing need for medical services and their responsibility for providing equal care for all groups the late dr thomas parran former surgeongeneral of the united states called the eightyear project one of the best jobs of volunteer public health work i have ever seen the work of the alpha kappa alpha health project attracted the attention of the late president franklin d roosevelt and miss jackson was invited to be his guest at the nations christmas tree lighting ceremony as founder and general director of the project miss jackson received an invitation from mrs roosevelt to attend along with the clinics medical director a conference at the white house to discuss operation of the clinics and other health problems mrs roosevelt became an honorary member of the sorority miss jackson was granted a leave of absence from the oakland school department to work towards a doctorate at columbia university and later to serve as dean of women at tuskegee institute alabama while at tuskegee she became an admiring friend of the late dr george washington carver who called her his inspiration also during her time at tuskegee she represented the university of california at berkeley at the inauguration ceremonies for a new president at dillard university she assisted the late dr mary mcleod bethune in the organization of the national council of negro women of which she is a life member and she was appointed an observer to the united nations organization meeting in san francisco in she is a life member too of the national education association and the national association for the advancement of colored people miss jackson was listed in whos who in colored america in and whos who on the pacific coast edition in she was voted one of the most outstanding women in america of the many outstanding roles miss jackson has playedshe remains always the teacher the ida l jackson library at the junior college in mississippi is named in her honor she makes cases of solicited books available to saints school in lexington even carrying loads there in her car she has served as a lecturer in human relations at stanford university and at mills college and her influence has been felt many times in oakland she has served as a director of the family service bureau the mayors committee on civic unity the urban league and as a volunteer in the oakland health departments night tb clinics during negro history week in the east bay negro historical society gave her a certificate of award for contributions to education and humanitarianism imbued with the idea that one of the enduring realities in life is service what is important to her is what she can contribute to others to miss jackson one has contributed if one can make something better and less barren for a deprived underprivileged life and if one can make other people think of doing the same resigning from her teaching and counseling position at mcclymonds high school because of business obligations at her ranch in mendocino county she has transferred her active concern for community betterment to this northern california area she would like to reserve part of her lookout ranch as a resort or camp for girl and boy scouts everythings in other hands lucilius time alone is ours ida l jackson is possessed of an excellent education which prepared her for freedom inseparable from responsibility and her high standards have guided her in using her time to make the world a better place in which to liveby example the thick whipping by louise m meriwether et me the razor strop francie i it dont whip m e mother get me that strop i went into the bathroom and took daddys razor strop off the rusty nail and walked back into the dining room and handed it to mother her light brown face plump like the rest of her was quivering with anger i had already started to whimper i only asked him for a nickel mother and it wasnt like asking a stranger the bastard had ratted on me my own uncle he was the only colored man we knew in harlem who had a steady job and daddy was always saying how lucky his brotherinlaw was cause the depression was so bad even the ofays couldnt find jobs leastways a negro it was and almost everybody was on relief including us uncle hiram was so stingy though that he never offered you a cent so i put it on his mind and asked him for a nickel and he squealed to mother soons she came home from her daywork in the bronx mother advanced on me and i saw with horror how she was holding that strop you aint gonna beat me with the thick end i couldnt believe it and i knocked down a chair getting out of her way mother kept on coming in all of my years i had never before been beaten with the thick end not because i was all that good but because i was a girl and daddys pet you got whipped with the thick end of the strop when you did something real bad otherwise you got a lick or two with the thin end daddy was always whipping on my brothers butts with that thick end especially james junior who had joined the ebony dukes and was running wild daddy said james junior was gonna disgrace us all sterling quiet and moody didnt get whipped much any more i aint gonna chase you all over this room mother said and she snatched me and dragged me into her bedroom and flung me down on the bed i was too longlegged to be put across her lap so she sort of kneeled on my back and pulled down my bloomers with one hand raising the strop with the other i told you before and i aint gonna tell you again you dont beg nobody for nothing each word was punctuated with a lash on my bare behind and i screamed so loud that mothers words got lost but i got the message when she was through mother went into the kitchen to wash some clothes while i sat there on her bed whimpering thinking my dinner hadnt been worth this whipping i had asked uncle hiram for that nickel so i could eat at father divines not that there wasnt something to eat at home mother always saw to that even if it was nothing but that gold can jive we got from the relief place which nobody in harlem would eat no matter how it was doctored up with onions and tomato paste the yellow label said it was canned beef but the rumor was it was horsemeat so we called it the gold can jive and it was weighing down the shelves in everybodys cupboards they also gave out butter and dried prunes at the relief place and our social worker who we called madame queen cause she was so snobbish acted like it was her instead of president roosevelt who was giving us the relief money and all that stuff daddy hadnt wanted to go on relief in the first place but mother kept complaining we was starving on the few bucks he made collecting numbers for frenchy a creole who ran a candy store on fifth avenue as a front for his policy business daddy finally agreed that mother could do housework for three days a week if she would just stop bugging him but a month later still complaining mother also applied for relief daddy hollered and cursed something awful but mother told him his pride wouldnt feed us and that was that anyway after uncle hiram gave me the nickel i had cents and i walked up to th street to father divines place because i hated the greasy collard greens and fat back we had at home and i wanted one of fathers cents chicken dinners peace its wonderful father divines place was a storefront i paid my cents at the door and found a seat at the round table in the middle of the room fathers followers and other people like me who were just plain hungry were jammed tight around that table gulping down their food with no side talk whatever one of fathers angels a huge black woman dressed in a bed sheet her hair nappier than the day she was bom brought me a plate of golden brown chicken from the kitchen she nodded at the bread and vegetables on the table meaning for me to help myself instead of grace you had to praise fathers holy name so i turned to the man next to me and said father divine is god would you please pass me that plate of blackeye peas when i finished eating i walked back home skirting mount morris park i liked the food at father divinesyou got more than you could eat for fifteen centsbut i always had to go alone none of my friends would come with me not even becky they were ashamed of those nappyheaded angels who wouldnt straighten their hair and wore white robes and changed their names to beloved theresa or sweet morning glory when they entered fathers kingdom i sat on mothers bed sulking about my whipping for about twenty minutes until mother called me to go to the store i walked into the kitchen its walls greasestained and peeling and mother handed me a list of things to buy and the credit book i hated to go to mr wellmans the grocer but seeing as how i just had gotten my butt whipped i didnt dare say a thing so i went on downstairs becky was sitting on my stoop i dont have to go to mr wellmans no more she said i told my mother this morning i just wasnt going did she slap you up side your head i asked no she sent nancy instead becky was almost and had those pretty west indian eyes with lights flashing in them nancy was her younger sister as i crossed fifth avenue dragging my feet to postpone the agony i wished i had a younger sister to send to the store i didnt mind mr wellman so muchhe was a nice roly poly west indianbut it was his wife and their snotty little girl yolanda that got next to me our relief money never got any further than mr wellmans and daddy said wed never get out of the hole that way after we paid mr wellman what we owed him we were broke so we started buying things on credit again the next day and his fat slob wife never failed to look at you crosseyed after you ordered all those bags of groceries and then held out the credit book instead of money i opened the door to the store and mourned my bad luck mrs wellman was behind the counter and yolanda ten plump and lightskinned like her mother with two black braids hanging to her shoulders was perched on a high stool next to the rice sack hello mrs wellman hello yolanda they both grunted at me ten cents worth of dried herrings i said its cents a pound mrs wellman stared at me my mother only wants ten cents worth my voice sank lower she threw the herrings on the scale and snatched them off before i could see how much she had given me i read the rest of the items off the list and watched as mrs wellman wrote the prices down on a large paper bag and added them up that will be two dollars and ten cents i held out the credit book mrs wellman stared at it like she had never seen it before which was silly she saw it almost every day when do you all get your relief money she asked the first of the month mrs wellman she knew it was the first she knew it she knew it finally she took the book and mumbling under her breath wrote the figure in it stuffed the groceries into the bag and shoved them over the counter towards me as i walked out the door yolandas eyes burned a hole in my back she never played with the rest of us and i dont know why me and becky let her upset us so after all she was only but she sat there on that stool silent and snotty making me feel that it wasnt only her store but her world and i had no place in it nobody goes to bed early in harlem in the summer cause its too hot to sleep so although it was close to midnight me and mother were still up she had finished washing and was sitting in her room figuring out the number for tomorrow daddy had taught her his system i was sitting at the dining room table reading a library book armed with my usual supply of weapons tonight i had a hammer a screwdriver and two hairbrushes when i heard a noise i threw the hammer towards the kitchen and the rats scurried back into their holes i was scared peeless by those rats they had already bitten everybody except me and mother and had run a cat we once had clean out of his mindchased him right into the living room wall i bet that cat kept on running until he got to brooklyn those rats grew fat on the rat poison mother was always putting down on raw potato slices and they thrived on the sulphur bombs mother was always gassing us with when i got down to my last weapon i would give up the dining room to them and go on to bed i couldnt keep my mind on my book though cause i was worried about my brothers wondering where they were so late and hoping they would beat daddy home so he wouldnt whip their behinds again i had just thrown the screwdriver down the hall when there was a sudden banging on the dining room door sudden noises scared me they usually meant something terrible had happened so i just sat there with my heart pounding not making a move whats the matter with you francie mother grumbled as she went to the door cant you hear all that banging you act more like an idiot each day it was true i was getting scared of everything it was mrs maceo our nextdoorneighbor breathing hard from her climb up to the top floor mr coffin home she asked lord they done stabbed mr edwards who done stabbed him mother asked i don know he laying down there in the hallway with an ice pick in his chest mother told mrs maceo that daddy wasnt home and they ran down the stairs with me trailing behind them the hallway was full of kids and there was papa dan mrs maceos husband stone drunk and drooling as usual the naked bulb hanging from the ceiling threw tall shadows on the wall and cast a halo around mr edwards our janitor lying so bloody and still at the foot of the stairs daddy came through the vestibule door and knelt beside him you kids go on back outside he ordered they retreated as far as the doorway jessie run across the street to the drugstore and call the ambulance mother rushed outside a crowd had gathered on the stoop and i searched their faces until i found my brothers they were there thank god james junior had daddys dark good looks while me and sterling were plain like mother daddy said though that i was pretty but both me and mother agreed he had strange ideas on the subject often claiming some thicklipped gal was a black beauty i was skinny and rusty and looked a mess i knew and couldnt understand it when people said i looked just like daddy james junior pushed his way through the crowd and came to me you all right francie i nodded james junior was sweet like that old moody sterling didnt even look in my direction just kept frowning and staring at the blood on mr edwards chest the police arrived first then the whitecoated ambulance doctors and suddenly all that was left of our janitor was a red stain on the dirty tile floor i had lived in harlem all of my life and should have been used to stabbings and shootings and sudden death especially in the summertime when the heat seemed to spur everybody to violence but i wasnt used to it and that night when i closed my eyes all i could see was mr edwards lying in that hallway so still so still he died the next day in harlem hospital it was rumored he had hit the number for a dollar with a runner from uptown who swore mr edwards hadnt put the number in that day mr edwards raved he would kill the sonofabitch and it was thought he just had got done in first but the police never did arrest that runner niggers killing niggers dont interest these cops daddy mumbled to mother a few days later mother didnt say anything but my eyes met hers and i saw fear in themfear that it could have been daddy lying in that bloody hallway and i realized for the first time that i wasnt the only one in that house whose heart was always beating like a drum our jewish landlord who lived in white plains offered daddy the janitors job and it became our lot to pull the garbage mop down the stairs and keep the backyard clean which was none too easy because it was simpler to throw garbage out of the window into the yard than to wait until six oclock when the garbage was pulled that dumbwaiter was a filthy slimy mess a permanent home for cockroaches and rats and i would just as soon open the window myself and sling the garbage out than open that dumbwaiter door daddy got up at five oclock in the morning to start the furnace in the basement before somebody started banging on the pipes for hot water but he made junior and sterling bank the fire at night and that kept them a little closer to home it was on account of that janitors job that madame queen cut us off relief daddy didnt get any pay for being the janitor just a reduction in rent and he didnt tell madame queen this right away so when she found out she cut us off daddy told her hed planned to tell her in about a month by the time he could break even with mr wellman but she didnt believe him as good as called daddy a liar mother said she would help out by doing three more days a week for her white ladys sister they dont give you enough money to live on daddy raved at mother so either you have to bootleg some kind of work or hit the number or rob somebody so your kids wont starve and anything you do is against the law damn bastards didnt i tell you in the first place i wanted nothing to do with these social workers but daddy didnt say mother couldnt work three more days so she did just that and was gone every day now except sunday now that mother was away so much we didnt eat dinner together any more my brothers came home at different times and ate in the kitchen daddy would put on some mustard greens and when i came home from school i would turn them off and cook a pot of rice daddy was a geechie so we had rice every day me and that rice it was either scorched or a soggy mess once daddy looked at it with disgust that day it was soggy why in hell dont you teach this girl to cook a decent pot of rice he roared at mother my feelings were hurt mother didnt bother to answer her silence saying louder than words that he was home all day so why didnt he teach me himself you a moron or something he turned on me that you cant cook a decent pot of rice my tears were instant i measure it out just like you do daddy only it gets dry while its still raw so i add more water the gas the gas daddy yelled he was always yelling these days youve got the damn gas turned up too high you dont boil rice you steam it the sight of my tears didnt make him turn gentle as it usually did he finished eating and banged out of the house mumbling that it was a goddamn shame a man couldnt get a decent pot of rice in his own house i felt bad for hours cause daddy seldom hollered at me but after that i didnt cook any more soggy pots of rice it was summer and we had been off relief for two months when mother finally hauled me down to the relief office with her things were so tight we were eating that gold can jive and i swear it was horsemeat it was that stringy mrs maceo told mother she ought to go on down to the relief office and pitch a bitch that was the only way to get anything mrs maceo said she put some soap in her mouth and went to that office foaming like a mad dog and didnt leave until they gave her a clothing allowance for her daughter mother told mrs maceo she would do likewise but i knew mother wasnt about to pitch no fit the relief place was across the street from mount morris park and all we did was sit around that office all day long seeing one supervisor then waiting years to see the supervisors supervisor what a system we had been there since nine oclock and had seen four people and it was almost three now mother was sitting at the desk of our fifth interviewer and i was standing by her side this one whose bumpy thin face was screwed into a frown like she was smelling piss all day long was the head flunky i hoped she preached at mother like she was a thief for trying to get even so all our checks wouldnt have to go to mr wellman we had sinned she made that clear they all did if daddy hadnt reported his janitors job why hadnt mother ratted on him it was her duty to her children to be truthful and godfearing did mother realize she had violated section g of the relief code mother was apologetic she didnt report that she too was bootlegging domestic work or they would have deducted money for that also she hung her head guilty and spoke softly she would never violate the rules again the lord knew but her children were hungry please forgive us our sins this one time and give us our daily bread and another supply of dried prunes and butter and that gold can crap i sat there looking like a ragpicker in my scuffed sneakers and patched skirt one of mothers hungry children wideeyed and innocent go screw yourself i said silently to the pimply face who was humbling my mother i was too mad to cry i would have yelled out loud or hit the woman who suddenly looked like madame queen they all did were it not for the look on my mothers face where had i seen that look before at whose funeral and i knew suddenly by the pain in my mothers eyes that she was beating herself with the thick end of the razor strap thats how we got back on relief the next week the checks started again and we were soon back in hock to mr wellman daddy never did ask mother how she got us back on and mother never did tell him had he known he would have disowned us both few problems and set limited as well as long range goals it becomes difficult to see progress to experience success and to feel a sense of accomplishment it is important for black groups to define their problems and the purpose of the group clearly to set out specific short and long range goals and to decide how they will measure success and determine progress this will ease much of the psychological frustration which builds up and becomes a depressive discouraging and divisive factor in the experiences of an organization related to this goal definition is an often found stumbling block in black groups which we will call the inability to set limits due in part to the need to speak up and to release rage and due in part to their lack of an agenda and a program much time in meetings of some black groups is spent testifying that is members very often stand up to testify to their dedication and acceptability as black militants they will display militant credentials and try to outblack each other they may harangue against honkies proclaim what they are going to do and put down other people as being uncle toms and handkerchief heads in essence they assume a blacker than thou attitude the problem with this behavior is that it becomes an end in itself in addition it tends to place a premium on militancy and personal qualities which soon become so exclusive that no one is black enough or down enough to be acceptable this all then becomes selfdefeating since members try to outdo each other and in the process exclude most of the group members on the other hand if goals were established it would be easier for group members to determine the acceptability of other members that is if the purpose of the group was to solicit money it would not be harmful for members to have white persons as friends in fact this could be advantageous however to take an extreme example if the purpose of the group was to arm itself for armed combat against whites it would be unrealistic to expect a black person married to a white person to participate wholeheartedly on the basis of the purpose and program of an organization therefore criteria could be more easily and less arbitrarily established what very often happens in these groups is that people are excluded on the basis of others feelings about who should be in and who should be out two more phenomena often seen in the meetings and behavior of black organizations prevent them from functioning effectively the first is the concentration on terminology and namecalling and the second is the severe negativism of certain group members an inordinate amount of meeting time is often spent arguing over terminology black groups will debate whether to use the term negro afroamerican or black and forget the major problems at hand this propensity to get sidetracked by peripheral issues happens too often in the life of black organizations for them not to recognize this as a destructive tendency when the discussions are over and the smoke clears the enemy is still white racism and all energies should be directed towards eliminating this discussions in black groups many times get bogged down and sidetracted by namecalling instead of recognizing differences among members but valuing the common cause individuals will begin to call some people uncle toms bourgeois or bourgies conservatives footshufflers black caucasians and a variety of other uncomplimentary names the members seem to lose sight of their common black identity and to see divisions and differences rather than similarities and group needs whether we approve or not there is a growing sense of black unity and solidarity as more and more afroamericans come to feel that their survival depends more upon group strength than upon individual strength presently many of these new groups are hampered by psychological difficulties much of which stems from the effects on blacks of a white racist heritage with time these newlyformed black groups will grow in effectiveness and have a potential to contribute a great deal to the progress of amity among americans mayfield i dont want to go around mouthing all that gossip about the extraliterary activities of harlem writers guild which leaped across into puerto rico and havana and then to our ancestral pads in accra i love my black writers especially if they are black all i aims to see em do man is to excel and make it but damn mayfield here you are sittin on all that fantastical experience about black writers in love and also exile with your poor readers thirsting for knowledge literary exaltation and a bit of honest healthy sensuous titillation come on now julian m bare your soul and tell all be a real literary adventurer a black lover with soul syntax an eagle eye for truth plus the right political line in your heart even if poor kwame nkrumah did goof give us the livin lowdown on what went down in ghana your readership will applaud posterity will enshrine you in literary sainthood and ill swear youll never have to make another movie as long as you live unless its from your new book the milk train doesnt stop in accra anymore the negro digest readership will not of course have any inkling at all of what i am here alluding to but it is to be understood that i am not of a mind to be spreading gossip as it came to me i would rather have mayfield supply the real truth about ghana and why he split accra for spain which used to own puerto rico julian was so involved in telling the readers about his conversations with intellectual royalty web du bois in ghana that i was licking my chops with anticipation i thought he might be leading up to some inside gossip pardon that word about kwame nkrumahs egyptian love who i am told was sent to nkrumah by nasser beautifully wrapped whatever happened to her also what happened to the first mrs nkrumah perhaps julian m is politically coy out of respect for kwames downfall well i can appreciate such sentiments i too loved kwame despite his goof but really julian m had open access to nkrumahs castle and the open sesame to a whole lot of official secrets the reader should understand that i am not at all interested in spreading gossip about the political and amorous misadventures of our black literary lions i am simply one who feels that there are very often close connections between love and politics which some black writers ought to explore in search of new themes after all john oliver killens julian mayfield and others conducted a workshop where i assume the problem of themes in black must have been debated at some length so after consideration of the fact that julian m hasnt published a novel in several years and after reading that disastrous last book of killens called sippi i have to wonder why is it that both killens and mayfield both allowed all that good luscious truelife material out of the harlem writers guilds early days to go completely to waste if mayfield refuses for good reasons to play the black henry miller then killens ought to step forth and rescue the black novel from the limbo of the protest civilwritism of the denatured black soul and tell it like it is or like it was indemdays but get thismayfield says to me there is nothing in the life which has been honestly lived that should be ignored if history happens to take any account of you if a man like du bois could confess that he was wrong then certainly people like cruse and myself ought to have the guts to admit to murder and rape man now that allusion to rape was a freudian slip if ever heard one because i am told that in the harlem writers guild well enough i await julian mayfield to follow his own advice on that score and write now again back to our cuban adventure mayfield in exposing my terrible unrevolutionary conduct managed to forget to mention the conduct of his colleague sarah wright who embarrassed us all by returning from the cuban hills to the hotel presidente about nine oclock in the morning and demanding that the waiters bring her a rum daiquiri from the hotel bar which was not in the habit of opening until late in the afternoon our social and political stock sure took a deep dip that day in havana when our cuban hosts heard about that miss wright didnt simply ask she was arrogant about it then there was the case of sarah wrights husband passing spot judgments on cuban race relations as a white man he did not even belong in our delegation because castro had asked for a contingent of black writers however in the leftwing whites are allowed to do as they please in black affairs and i didnt hear mayfield complaining then there was the case of the writer whose name i wont mention who demanded that the cuban government pay the hotel for a bottle of liquor he ordered that was the first of a series of unrevolutionary examples of bad conduct which occurred before i cried for water in the hills i could tell more but i dont like too much gossip mayfields problem is that he never fully understood the movement he was only marginally a part of he came into the harlem movement from his broadway role in lost in the stars and touched the harlem party only as far as its cultural fringes thus he functioned in the privileged and exclusive segment of the party the other side which he purports to tell about he doesnt really know it seems that nobody but mayfield is vague about who and what was the harlem writers club in its conflict with communist party headquarters in harlem i think i made this explicit enough but not enough for mayfield this is because mayfield does not know that in black nationalism was not a trend in the communist party at all however any black party member who challenged the role of whites in the harlem party structure was immediately labeled a bourgeois antiwhite nationalist that is what i was called but black nationalist and black nationalism were not in our vocabulary at that time what mayfield is really complaining about is that i didnt tell enough about me personally it was however not my intentions to write an autobiography about my exploits in the party that is another kind of a book if i had written an autobiography of my marxist career it would have necessitated indulging in the same kind of gossip that mayfield indulges in in his challenge and it is good thing i didnt he is so unknowledgeable about the harlem party affairs that he makes this statement in he cruse was upandcoming marxist theoretician not a black nationalist and not a mere rankandfiler like the rest of us i can remember how we youngsters looked up to him because he functioned on a policymaking level speaking from a background of such authority cruse could no doubt tell us more than he has in his book and the average reader would understand how he came to know so much as we have already decided i hope not prematurely that cruse is not bucking for a job in washington my only conclusion is that he wants to be sure he is in step with the younger militants by establishing a background that he has always been antiwhite and antiintegrationist this statement is laughable and infantile because i was never on a policymaking level and mayfield was never any rankandfiler i was the chairman of the harlem writers club which was the pioneer black communist writers group established in harlem after the war mayfield obviously never knew what constituted the policymaking level in harlem or what actually went on there it was those communist leaders on the harlem policy making level who did not want the harlem writers club to exist at all this writers club was harassed by the leadership in harlem from its very inception to the time it disbanded this was what further embittered me the chairman against the harlem leadership how could i be thrust into a position of clashing with the harlem leadership as the chairman of a writers club and at the same time be a functioning part of the harlem policymaking level on page of my book i explicitly describe the clash between the writers club and the harlem leadership on page i write our ideas on the matter of integration were not too clearcut or definitive we were certainly not against integration of the negro in the arts but at the time it struck us that since negroes had no flourishing ethnic arts institutions pursuing this integration theme was like launching a campaign with no thought of building a starting base this was the attitude that i and others had about integration which was definitely a farcry from black nationalism it would certainly be asking mayfield too much to read my book carefully because he has clearly stated he doesnt like the book that is his privilege because it wasnt written for mayfield and his friends to like contrary to him i have never tried to make the younger generation believe that i was always antiwhite or antiintegration i was neither until my experiences in the communist party made me critical of whites as assumed leaders of blacks and progressively doubtful of many of the claims for racial integration eighteen years after his broad way debut mayfield is still lost in the stars concerning the political and cultural implications of the communist leftwing this is because he was never a true rankandfiler who had to struggle his way up from the ranks as an unknown he came into the harlem movement with the prestige of a broadway role in a hit musical play and functioned as a minor celebrity with all the privileges which that entailed for a negro actor in this was a signal achievement and mayfield in still views the political and cultural scene from that remembered vantage point it is very natural for him to leap to the defense of his cultural and political trend of thinking writing etc for i am critically attacking a political and cultural trend even though my method and tone takes on a somewhat personal character however julian mayfield should remember that the communists themselves are the most practiced masters of this type of cultural and political polemic they inflicted it on me for a spell on several occasions and i waited a long time for the day when i would be able to return the critical thrust on the same terms and i repeat it was not meant to be liked or agreed with by mayfield or anyone else i would also advise julian mayfield that it is to my credit that i kept the personal animus down to its barest minimum by keeping myself out of the critique as much as possible what i personally did or didnt do is not of much importance in however what is important is what i saw understood and objectively experienced it was my duty and responsibility as a social critic to put it down on paper for posterity finally the basic deficiency in julian mayfields defensive challenge to my book in which little or nothing was challenged but my right to write it is one that has its roots in the crisis of the black intellectual which is my theme these black intellectuals of our generation born between the two great wars simply dont know anything and seldom even think it important to find out anything beyond what might be necessary to get a college degree in this regard mayfield ponders the question of how i came to know so much oh julian thou doth my ego proud that thou doth deign to marvel at my historical eruditionor man you know that cat mustve sho been diggin into them history tomes cause he is so historically hep he is outa sight no julian not only am i a communist party dropout who never got to be a leader on a policymaking level as you assert i was also a high school dropout and delinquent who later reformed upon discovering that if one wanted to know anything one had to read later on i learned that if one wanted to read properly one had also to learn research so i became a researcher research clarifies many questions that exist clothed in vague ambiguities like too many of our black creative intellectuals julian mayfield shows that he is not a researcher which renders him a poor analyst this intellectual deficiency causes him to miss the implications of much of my bookfor example my preoccupation with the career of claude mckay and his communist connections claude mckay himself was critical of people and their communist connections for me to review the times of claude mckay and his contemporaries in the light of their communist connections is not the same thing as putting them on a crap list but represents an attempt at an historical method of literary and social criticism the fact that mayfield persists in thinking this way indicates that in his chosen disciplinethe novelhe can hardly be expected to rise above the ordinary because novelwriting on a higher level is also a form of social criticism but then one has to remember that mayfield is also an actor of some note and i think the acting impulse is strongest with him many black actors have difficulty in drawing the proper line between social reality and the world behind the footlights anguish by addison gayle jr e just wanted to march to show our respect said renee thats all we didnt want no violence we just wanted to march because he was a great leader she would remember this day april as the longest of her life earlier she had attended a rally called to protest the racist slurs of a professor at city college she had implored her fellow students to besiege the members of the state legislature with letters in an attempt to save seeka college program for young students from the ghetto what that professor said about us you know it really dont count i mean he aint that important but them legislators up there in albany if they dont appropriate some money for this program well you know like we in trouble she had remained at the college after classes to ask nonseek students to join in her protest much later she had attended a concert of africanamerican dance and music here she heard the announcement the girl on the stage stopped dancing and she mumbled something but she had such a thick accent you know that we couldnt understand her then somebody ran into the auditorium and told us that dr_king was dead i didnt believe it no i still dont they left the auditorium in the middle of the concert joining hands with almost other students black and white renee marched down convent avenue to th street where a worried john lindsay pleaded with the students to halt we stopped said renee but other people they had followed us you know came along with us and then they started this the this was sporadic looting rock throwing and the hurling of crudelymade molotov cocktails two men their arms bulging with loot from a nearby mens store rushed past unseen by members of the tactical police force who stood fourabreast across the street from the baby grand night club as smoke darkened the sky in the vicinity of lenox avenue fire engines screamed past th street now barricaded by police vehicles en route to th street renee shook her head she was shocked and confused and a stare of disbelief prevailed in her young eyes now and then the revolving lights of the police vehicles accented the deep lines of her ovalshaped black face he didnt approve of violence she mumbled and it aint right to do this there was something pathetic in her words a sadness in her hurried statements a look of confusion in her oncebright eyes that told of the tragedy of the moment in a way that no statement from civil_rights leaders no pious declaration from public officials no in memoriam from gifted writers ever could martin_luther_king jr had not been her hero a child of the black_power revolution her heroes were stokely carmichael malcolm_x and leroi jones such men articulated her grievances in a way that dr_king had not true enough she could be momentarily swayed by his eloquence and was subject to moments of ecstasy in anticipation of actual contact with him yet his sonorous tones his calculated delivery of parethetical constructions his ofttimes thunderous miltonic inversions were the machinery of that evangelical past which she now disparaged hers was the world of camus of fanon of malraux and martin_luther_king jr seemed antithetical to all that that world symbolized so it was with most of her fellow students they stood together huddled in a small circle as if seeking protection from whatever danger manmade or otherwise lay concealed in the semidarkness of this frightful night they were young men and women for whom martin_luther_king jr had symbolized not the success of the future but instead the failure of the past previously they had denounced him in the most vitriolic terms quoted words from the autobiography of malcolm_x to refute his philosophy and spoken cynically though kindly of his proposed poor peoples march on washington only their elders had truly kept the faith they too came to the street comers some were drawn by the excitement generated by the events of the day others dazed benumbed sought solace in the company of those whose misery was akin to their own still others weaving between the groups of people made their way to the many churches in which harlem abounds yet they were united in one common endeavor the old and the young those who had kept the faith and those who had renounced all faith attempting to hold on to some small part of that vision which had been dr_kings most important asset the old had believed passionately fervently even to the point of idolizing the man who articulated the dream but the young had believed also their pressent militancy not withstanding the dream of martin luther king jr was more than the dream of their fathers and no matter the disclamees they spoke the postures they assumed the vehemence with which they rejected the american society the vision of an america free of prejudice intolerance and injustice was also theirs and now tonight on this most terrible of nigthts dr_kings importance was finally recognized the most sincere and eloquent spokesman of their cause was deadassassinated by a white man thats it for me a neatly dressed young man remarked in passing they do something like that to a man like king a man like king why one of the students asked her eyes red why him he didnt like no violence murmured renee almost incoherent and they killed him anyway she began to cry for the first time she could no longer not believe reality was too powerful once begun the tears a long time in coming rushed from her eyes as if propelled by a mechanical pump she stared at the top of a tenement building a few blocks away we just wanted to show our respect you know to show our respect because he was a great leader another student broke the circle of silence to echo her words yes a great leader she did not hear she stood buddhalike seeing and yet not seeing her eyes fixed upon the top of the building all too soon the long day had come to an end sorry to discomfort you chauncey warringham hildredth iii esq we know how distasteful it is for you to be reminded that most americans who resemble you are secondclass citizens we know you are the exception after all your parents were professional people who brought you up in a stable middleclass neighborhood you were integrated from elementary school through university and you are the only negro holding down a job like yours in a white firm yes we understand and we sincerely regret embarrassing you with all these demonstrations and freedom songs and sitins and boycotts we are sorry that because you look like us white people tend to lump you together with us however we ask you to endure the painful situation out of charity for those not so fortunate as you we recognize that this might not appeal to you especially but we feel that our concerted efforts to attain genuine freedom of opportunity and movement for all americans now are in the national interest ultimately we believe that a truly free america is an america of unsurpassable strength it is even possible that your children will be the immediate beneficiaries since they have a better education than most and are best qualified to accept the jobs which civil_rights pressures are opening up so have patience mr chauncey warringham hildredth iii the battle you are watching with such great aloofness sir is really your own the fragmented movement by s e anderson ver since the first slaves the black liberation movement in america has embraced at least five different goals in the past the styles and rhetoric have been noticeably different for each goal today there are dangerous similarities in style and rhetoric between those who seek incorrect accommodationistwithdrawers goals and those who seek the correct revolutionary one at this prerevolutionary juncture it is imperative that black people be informed about our fragmented and stagnant movement what is attempted here is a contribution to black critical analysis of the five major factions within the black movement the integrationist historically the integrationist has incorrectly viewed the american institutions as racist by exception rather than by rule the integrationist believes in the deception of the american governmental structure having provisions for black redress of grievances he also believes that he actually can participate in the decisionmaking processes of his country and that because of a few racist and economic barriers black people have been denied their full firstclass share of the capitalistic goodies the integrationist believes that we have progressed through moral suasion via civil_rights legislation in most cases he accepts black culture as a somewhat lesser tributary culture of the white american cultural mainstream most integrationists do not see america as a powerful but degenerate world imperialist those integrationist who do see this feel that by injecting blackfolk into the existing american framework they will cool out the degeneracy it is clear they do not fathom the fact that when power corruptsit corrupts absolutely the integrationist believes in the minorityconcept that is america is at once a meltingpot and a pluralistic society this belief hides the most ram pant and fundamental problem racism it is extremely important to take note of the integrationists religious acceptance of capitalism being the best most humanistic politicoeconomic system to them all capitalism needs in order to fulfill the american dream is some black reform in the final analysis the integrationist suicidally depends upon white analysis and white assertions to determine his destiny he views selfdetermination as solving the bourgeois desires of materialism and immoralism to have the money to choose an el dorado over a continental to be able to determine without guilt which white bitch should have her racial myths fulfilled indeed the integrationists interests are selfish corrupt and diametrically opposed to the liberation of black people the citystatesman there are similarities between the integrationist and the citystatesman with regard to their reactionary attitude to every white american assertion one segment of the citystatesman group envisions the american politicoeconomic structure as legitimate and thus seeks to enter it by initially withdrawing and building the blackening cities into politically and economically powerful quasiautonomous citystates destined to vie for influence and control of white americas capital and resources the other segment believes that black cities can be simultaneously independently autonomous of the american doliticoeconomic structure and also exist within it as communal noncapitalist citystates what citystatesman cannot or refuse tosee is that white america will allow a pluralistic society only on its terms with respect to how it will be benefited yes white america will give up her cities to blacksand move all of its vital institutions industry communications banks airports etc into the suburbs the black citystates would be surrounded by white police and military forever on the edge of their triggers most of the citystates capital would be funnelled in through federal aid this would mean that the us government would have the first and last say about how and when to spend who should work and who should not many citystatesmen believe that these islands of black people surrounded by the sea of white america physically constitute a black nation they fail to realize that to have a nation is to have land control of human and natural resources and a culture defined and common among the people the nationalism of the citystatesman serves merely as an aid to white america in retaining black people as colonial subjects more precisely colonies have the facade of being independent if the colonized bourgeoisie are the administrators and civil servants the im mediate authority is loyalist black and the ultimate authority is the white colonizer witness the struggle for community control of the black schools the government will allow community control of the schoolsas long as they determine the framework philosophy hiring policies and the finances currently there are two different political proposals which are being discussed among the citystatesmen one is to politically deal through the democratic and republican parties as black blocs the other is to form a third political partysome say allblack others say a blackradicalwhite coalition party a la peace and freedom party the blacks who seek changes through these two proposals do not understand the following two things that one of the reasons why political parties become viable parties within the white american context is that they are founded upon racist assumptions and the limitations of black political parties having no alliance with the militaryindustrial complex for it is primarily because the democratic and republican parties are extension of the militaryindustrial complex that they are existing a black political party cannot align with any type of white political or economic institution unless it is a political party of suicidal blacks we must never forget that it is the nature of every white institutionbe it radical liberal or conservativeto be racist and therefore exploitive towards blackfolk back to africaism this sect splits itself into two fundamental factions a the brothers and sisters who want only to physically return to africa and b the brothers and sisters who want only to spiritually culturally and socially return to africa superficially to many the two ideas sound good but upon a deeper analysis we discover that they are not good ideas they are rather symptoms of withdrawal the afroamerican who wishes for a permanent mass migration of blackfolkor even a permanent migration of intellectuals and techniciansto africa is one who consciously or unconsciously affirms the myth of the invincible white man in most cases it is the intellectual rationalization of a brothers inability to struggle against oppressive forces hence some suggest that we return to africa and lead africa toward a colonialfree destiny how does the repatriatist know that our african brothers want us to lead them anywhere our african brothers are having enough hard times struggling against their internal and neocolonial contradictions to also have to cope with the psychocultural hangups of afroamericans this is to say that we do not abandon our communications military economic and cultural exchange between us rather it is to accentuate at this stage the necessity for twoway exchange of individuals rather than a oneway mass migration we cannot escape the racism and colonialism of america by running to africa because americas racism and colonialism are institutionalized everywhere moreover if most of our revolutionary forces were in africa we would be committing a cardinal sin withdrawing ones forces from the belly and brain of the enemv it should be made clear that this does not mean that brothers should not go over and join the african liberation armies it means those chosen afroamerican brothers who do so should not be only highly skilled in guerilla warfare but also skilled in some field relevant to the needs of the african country for which he is fighting on the other side of the backtoafrica mask we are confronted with the apolitical cultural nationalists they stress that if black people dug on the natural fact that black is beautiful then they would be liberated the apolitical cultural nationalists fail to check out the neocolonies of africa ghana nigeria senegal liberia kenya malawi etc in these countries blackfolk by and large still see blackness as beautifulbut it has not liberated them thev do not control their resources tneir capital or their politics witness all the military coups the africans culture is somewhat in tact and creative but without a political framework culture is not a liberatory force the root of the matter is that afroamerican apolitical cultural nationalists perceive blackness as necessary and sufficient when in reality blackness is necessary but not sufficient on the psychocultural level apolitical cultural nationalism is a reaction and withdrawal rather than an assertion once again we see that it is a negative spiral inward because of the belief in the myth of the white mans invincibility it is also a desire to prove to ones ego and to the white man that a black man is creative out of this frustration of contradictions sprout black cults and mysticism ie withdrawal symptoms the black artist becomes more of a nihilist than a creative person he perceives blackfolk as his burden instead of his inspiration the center of the universe becomes an overglorification of his ego african history and paradoxically the black masses through constructive criticism and the existence of correct ideology many of the straightupanddown cultural brothers and sisters will redirect their creativeness and become functional people embraced by a revolutionary political structure black nation concept imbedded in the rationale of most brothers seeking a new black nation are withdrawal symptoms resembling those of the backtoafrica brothers the black nation concept does notand cannot deal with the fact that black peo pie built america by their enchained sweat blood and brains america is ours for the take withdrawing from america does not weaken or eradicate its racism to the contrary in withdrawal america is strengthened and offered an almost perfect framework for black genocide white america would view the new black nation as a black communist threat more concretely judging from the types of brothers and sisters who expound defend and rally around this idea it exudes the belief that it is impossible to liberate black people within the awesomely powerful confines of white america hence the new black nation concept reeks with contradictions one of the most blatant contradictions is that of white people being willing to pay for the birth of a black nation on the one hand the new nation separatists vividly describe america as being by naturea racist country that has systematically excluded blackfolk from all its institutional processes indeed this is true then by what twist of fate would white racist america wish to aid in the development of a black nation right at its doorstep unless exploitation and genocide was in mind many of the new nation separatists suggest that scattered blackcontrolled cities constitute a nation this contradiction has been discussed above a federation of cities as a nation is stressed rather than the evolutionary development of revolutionary nationalism among black people many discuss the idea of a getting electoral control of the cities and the black belt then b inviting the united nations as world observer of white america because c international law allows five or six southern states to secede from the union history has exposed the united nations as anything but humanistic and neutral history has shown that the united nations and its international laws are mere tools of america and its western allies for the maintenance of their imperialist machine witness the united states breach of the geneva conventions decisions concerning vietnam witness the arabisraeli conflict witness the u ss instantaneous intervention into the dominican republic in witness the congo interventionbut no intervention in south africa it is crystal clear that the international laws deal with nonwhites exactly in the same manner as americas constitutional laws as colonial subjects the republic of new africa appoints brother robert f williams as presidentinexile robert f williams is a romantic revolutionary partially of his own makings and partially because he has not been continually on the american scene being a brother exiled in the third world one should take note of the other governmentsinexile such as the tiny antimaoist island of formosa and the counterrevolutionary claguided revolutionary angolan government in exile when the socalled leader or groups are not in physical and spiritual touch with their people they fall prey to romanticism and cooptation when the new nation concept fails to understand the relationship between military strategy and geography we witness a pathetic and selfdefeating contradiction the republic of new africa is to be created from the southern states j east of texas and north of florida strategically florida would be i come an ideal american military base in terms of military strategy for the new republic of new africa it would have to spread its forces to defend three land borders the north south and west in brief the new nation concept is the pipedream of black nationalists frustratedly overwhelmed because of their simplistic approach to white racism and colonialism revolutionary nationalism in conclusion if we are for the liberation of black people then we must seek the correct path towards revolution that is the path of revolutionary nationalism more precisely we must seek change change in institutions change in who is in charge change in values then we must be able to implement and enforce these changes in other words america as it exists today must be completely destroyed and then rebuilt in the terms of the new black manfor whites have rendered themselves incapable of humanistic creativity the methodology for correct revolutionary nationalism is comprised of reformist stages dialogues designed to change negroes into blacks education lifelong commitment and consistent criticism of self and ideology and most important winning the confidence of black people brother bill strickland constantly reiterates and correctly so that there has been no critique of the american society visavis black reality there have only been reactions to the system and not a development of a countersystem why because black intellectuals accept white analysis as the correct analysis this has historically resulted in black people acting more like accommodationists and withdrawers than resisters this is not to deny the historical fact of daily slave rebellions or the current urban uprisings it is merely to emphasize that our actions have been apolitical and oftentimes vacuous because of a lack of a black critique of the american scene further negative consequence of blacks dependency upon white analysis is the legitimacy of corruptness within the black movement because whites are corrupt and immoral their liberalradical analysis is corrupt and immoral the movements corruption is just the symptom the flame one of the root causesor fuels is the absence of a welldefined line rhetoric serious black terminology is loosely thrown around by integrationists separatists and pseudorevolutionaries the black fascists a doyourownthing atmosphere surrounding the movement makes it valid for an accommodationist like whitney young and his urban league colleagues to support black_power it makes it valid for an opportunist such as roy innis to negotiate with the colonial powers for the sake of black selfdetermination and black economic power the rootlessness of the terminology invites a myriad of wierd immoral and agent prococateurs to satisfy their twisted and often antiblack lusts we will see that through a tightly defined terminology of black morality will develop its existence will transpose every actincluding the sexual actinto an ethical and political act this is not to say that the black movement will be entrenched in rigidity a black morality will naturally mean firmness and flexibility the black moralitys vitality lies in its ability to define confine and refine our liberation struggle it is the black aethestics becoming ethical and the black ethics becoming aethestical it is the black man seeing himself as a revolutionary more than that it is the brother or sister who asserts that to be a revolutionary is to be for life never forgetting that we must have an undying love for our people we must struggle to learn and learn to struggle audre lordes the first cities the poets press inc is a quiet introspective book you first notice the striking phrases the crash of passing sun a browning laughter the oyster world then you notice the images most of them drawn from nature a source unusual in this age of urban poets who write of concrete and machines but audre lorde is not a nature poet her focus is not on nature but on feelings and relationships the nature images many of them pertaining to the seasons illustrate inner weather the changes of love or feelings earth is still sweet for autumn teaches bearing and new sun will warm our proud and cautious feet but spring came once and we have seen the road that led through summer beautiful and bright as clover on a hill become a vast appalling wilderness and rain while we stood still racked on the autumns knowing audre lorde writes of birth now that i am forever with child my head rang like a fiery piston my legs were towers between which a new world was passing of death in father son and holy ghost each week a different woman regular as his one quick glass each evening pulls up the grass his stillness grows of love in the limpid a lovers song give me fire and i will sing you morning finding you heart and a birth of fruit give me fire and i will sing you evening asking you water and quick breath she does not wave a black flag but her blackness is there implicit in the bone in suffer the children those who loved them remember their childs laughter but he whose hate has robbed him of their good has yet to weep at night above their graves some day a man will thirst for sleep in his southern night and in coal love is a word another kind of open as a diamond comes into a knot of flame i am black because i come from the earths inside take my word for jewel in your open light audre lorde for the most part writes in a rhythmic sparsely punctuated free verse sometimes as in to a girl who knew what side her bread was buttered on she uses rime and we notice the emphasis and the richness of sound which rime imparts audre lordes poems are not strident and do not grab you by the collar and drag you in but they attract you by their fresh phrasing which draws you to return to them and to discover new evocations dudley randall a young sister audrey lee from the city of brotherly love has penned her first novel the clarion people mcgraw hill catherine marshall has said on the back cover audrey lee gives us a close look at the havoc wrought on the sensitive spirit of one human being by the concrete jungle of a great city with its impersonality and its callousness here at last realism is carried beyond superficial recording of ugliness or violence on through passion lets stop right there lillian peoples the protagonist catches a train from a small town to go to the city where her fatherat leastthinks she can get an education in life thats the plot both miss lee and mrs marshall have missed the point of the novel the clarion people shows a writer with much promise for definition and explanation once she begins to live in this world the clarion people shows what can happen to a young girl who decides to submerge the problems she cant deal with and create the ones she can like sex tipping out on god and virginity without city hall giving approval is not really a problem take our word for it miss lee most women get laid at some point without the sanction of god or city hall and some have been known to find it fun there is little doubt that the most christian people in this country and perhaps the most religious people in the world are our people the life situation which unfolds on clarion street says over and over again that faith has nothing to do with how we live lillian peoples like a cracked record repeats if we just keep the faith we will have it made we have kept the faith and found often to our dismay that faith has nothing to do with getting made on her train into the big callous impersonal city and we really think its time we defined the city in terms of black people being controlled by the little callous impersonal suburbs she meets a two bit hustler named nat now if lillian hadnt been fresh from the country she would never have turned her head toward a nat anyway but sources close to the top tell us thats why fresh country girls journey from home is it really worth a novel our sources also report that he who is had wanted to be or as my grandmother was fond of saying the race is not won by the strongest or the swiftest but by he who endures to the end she was probably quoting malcolm put it another way said something bout chickens coming home to roost the question of sex and the black community has intrigued us for some time eldridge cleaver has an excellent essay on it in soul on ice you see black people have no power yet we are supposed to be the most sexually potent people in at least this country only sex is supposed to be animalistic voila we lose again getting a clear sexual conscience isnt necessarily easy what with the dual standard set for black people but already having tried god for at least the last years we canand should look elsewhere for the solution marriage which has been our very dubious privilege only since emancipation hasnt proven an answer either witness the complaining suburbanites we tend to believe excedrin headache number one is a bad lay the questions areand will be for some timewhat are our needs in a given situation and how do we get them filled our need isnt a father image with as many men running in and out of our homes as reports tell us how could we lack a male image it isnt job either at one point we were percent employed lillian peoples wants sex and drugs to be the problem and faith to be the answer it just doesnt work out that way the problemlillians mine and yoursis a problem of lack of power take a look around you miss lee black philadelphia doesnt suffer from a lack of faith it lacks power it does not lack freedom from sin it lacks freedom wed like to see miss lee a young sensitive writer begin to deal with our true problems or to create situations where we win through our power to control if god has as a popular song once said the whole world in his hands then he created clarion streetnot us but we since we are living there must make it what we want it to be regardless of hisor white suburbias wishes perhaps we should as tobacco road tells us tear it down and start all over again then perhaps a new race of men as margaret walker so beautifully said may emerge write about thatnikki giovanni a short story by paula fox fter the funeral we a stood around awhile on the street corner right near the funeral parlor there was a lot of vegetables in crates sitting out in front of a grocery store and i couldnt help my eyes sliding over to those big purple bananas that the puerto ricans buy flies was buzzing over everything but those purple bananas wasnt even sweating like the other fruit flies didnt bother them they lay there looking like they was in a cold cellar they made me feel bad and i dont know why my wifei dont live with her no more but we still marriedshe was crying and moping up her face and pulling at her dress because she was so hot i couldnt stop myself from seeing she was getting fat especially in her shoulders why do i have to notice so much somel times i wish i was a little like her holler when things are bad and n h laugh when its okay but not me im always seeing the things that are all around what i should be paying attention to like when i go for a job im watching the mans face seeing how his teeth fit in his jaws what his shirt cuffs look like and what hes got on his desk instead of asking him where and how much and how long mv wife calls curtis the little baby i dont understand why she thinks hes so little he is old enough to be buried in his cadet suit qu te a few people came to the funeral mostly neighbors i guess even my brother came i havent seen him for eight years and after he looked at curtis lying in the coffin he remarked how big hed grown but then the last time hed seen curtis was just a few months after hed been born when we were still living in brooklyn before we moved uptown what are you looking at those vegetables for when you should be thinking about your dead baby my wife cried and yvonne who is now started howling and grabbed my wife around her middle yvonne looked very neat i noticed and her shoes were all polished up i hadnt seen her for a long time i used to go by and visit them but my wife and i always had to have our fight and it got so the children would just go out of the room to get away so i hardly ever had a chance to talk to them what good is thinking about him going to do him now i asked her you should of thought about him when you let him go up to the roof all the time just so you could be alone to work yourself all up about what a mean bastard i was and how bad i did you she began to yell and moan i couldnt even make out what she was saying i started wondering how they got curtis to look so nice when he had fallen four stories to the street then the grocer came out and waved his hands at us and shouted in spanish calling us names probably most of the people who had come to the funeral had gone off down the street my brother was standing in front of the funeral parlor and talking to light marsh who is my wifes cousin i dont know why he came to curtis funeral thats a man whos hardly interested in anything living or dead except his car but he was going to drive us out to the cemetery so i didnt make my usual remarks about him it was a terrible hot drive light all the time talking about these gadgets hes got for his caddie and pointing at them with his long finger and driving with the other hand while my wife carried on in her corner my brother kept grinning at light and then turning around to look sad at me yvonne rested herself against my ribs and i patted her head and felt sorrier for her than i did for anybody else suddenly she looked up while light and my brother were arguing about which was the fastest way to the cemetery why did they have that doll in the window she asked me at first i didnt know what she meant then i remembered that in the funeral parlor window on a shelf there had been this plastic doll held upright by some kind of metal prong and the doll had a crown and was wearing some kind of lace cape when i first walked in i had noticed how dusty the shelf was and how the crown looked like it was made out of a silver candy wrapper i dont know i answered isnt it supposed to be for dead people why they get that doll then she whispered maybe shes supposed to be a saint of something like that i said dont tell her none of your lies my wife said light had begun to talk about the war and this country and how crazy everything was getting and what hard times were coming and i laughed hard times coming i said what i want to know is when are they goingt you ought to get into a steady business my brother said i think hes been saying that since i was three and he was five you mean like the numbers i asked why dont you go to school and take up something he asked you ought to grab whats there he know all about grabbing said my wife did it hurt curtis yvonne asked all of a sudden i got scared sitting in that big white car that probably had payments left on it with my brother all shut into his best suit and my wife getting fatter every minute and light marsh telling me all about the world and yvonne asking me questions like i was supposed to know everything no baby no it couldna hurt him my wife said he didnt know what hit him the ground hit him yvonne said and sat up straight then pretty soon yvonne starts out with daddy but we was there and i got busy getting out of the car ill never know what she was going to ask me maybe who the hell was i anyhow some of the people who had been at the parlor had got there their own way and they were standing near the hole with the preacher his head was bowed and sweat was running doyn his forehead they had this carpet maybe five feet by five made out of stuff that was supposed to look like grass and it was spread over the dirt they had dug out of curtis grave there were so many gravestones sticking up out of the ground you wouldnt think there was room for one more child the coffin was closed up now it had a sling around it so it could be lowered into the ground there were two men standing a few yards away leaning on shovels gravediggers i guess they were wearing caps and work clothes they didnt have any expression at all on their faces but even so i thought they was laughing at us maybe its because i figure colored people is funny to white people whether theyre dead or alive i had this picture of myselfit was so fast i hardly saw itof me lifting up one of those shovels and bashing their heads in they threw some dirt on curtis and lowered him and i heard the preachers voice getting louder but i couldnt get any sense out of what he was saying the graveyard stretched further than i could see i heard cars so i knew there must be big highways all around light said hed drive us back to the parloi my brother went off with some man who was going his way he shook my hand before he left and told me not to feel too bad and i said yeah id try not to light showed off all the way back asking yvonne would she like a doll and telling me to drop around hed get me a good job and asking how we was paying for all this funeral expense i didnt want to talk about that i gave my wife the thirtyeight dollars i had and she must have got the rest somewhere maybe from her daddy who runs an elevator in an apartment building downtown and has a little house with a yard in the bronx i dont know why he didnt come to curtis funeral maybe because he knew id be there we got out of the car in front of the grocery store my wife wasnt crying anymore but she looked awful her hat was coming down the back of her head and her eyes looked big and starey you want to go to a movie i asked what is the matter with you she said yeah daddy can we go yvonne asked well i thought it would be better so you dont have to go back home right now theres a loews right up here near by she was looking at me but i was looking over her shoulder there were fewer bananas in the box now somebody must have been buying them while we were out putting curtis in the ground dont you feel badt she asked like shed been thinking hard to find the thing to say that would straighten me out i feel bad i said then we all started to walk up the block and pretty soon we came to the movie i didnt look to see what was playing it was cool inside that big black coolness ive always liked about movies hardly anybody was in there a few people with nothing to do getting out of the sun i bought yvonne some peanuts and she settled back in her seat my wife took off her hat and sank down and rested her head they were showing a cartoon it didnt look so good on that big screen the animals had those faces that dont look like anything living or dead and the voices they put in them were screaming and laughing and hooting so loud it made me hunch down in the seat i don t know but i think theres nothing worse than that nothing sadder anyhow than a movie on a hot weekday afternoon with maybe a dozen people sprinkled around watching a cartoon thats supposed to be for children i began to feel so bad sitting there looking at my wifes and yvonnes faces in the light from the screen then looking back at the cartoon and seeing some goddam big mouse in a cape running along the floor that i couldve yelled and then i did yell my wife and yvonne grabbed me up out of the seat and took me up the aisle and i was yelling all the time thinking of how the street would be of those sweating rotting vegetables at the grocers and that plastic doll and light marsh in his white mans car and curtis dead and dressed up like he was going to war and the man i had to see tomorrow about a job sorting packages none of it mattered not even my yelling mattered we were all gone not just curtis but yvonne my wife and me gone gone gone toward a black aesthetic by don l lee hat is a black poet w what is black poetry what is the black aesthetic these and other surface questions have become central topics for discussion at most literary circles and in my estimation need more than surface answers obviously if we deal properly with the three questions posed we will discover some of the basics of black art a black poet is not a negro he is first and foremost a black man or woman he is positive of his identity and has no second thoughts on how he should address himself he fully realizes as sncc points out that the slave traders brought black men and africans to this country not negroes whereas the negro is a filthy invention which didnt come into existence until about these brothers and sisters write out of a concept of self rather than that of a negro or imitation white ie he will relate the black experiencein essence his true experiencewhich is a result of his lifestyles undoubtedlythe true black experience in most cases is very concrete and is opposed to any unrelated abstractions concrete sleeping in subways being bitten by rats six people living in a kitchenette the images and symbols that are used will come out of the poets immediate surroundings and will accent his particular lifestyle this means that black poets will deal with themselves as individuals first and then will move toward a concept of peoplehood better yet they will move from the i to the we to the us and to the our the black poet is at all times in tune with his people he is an integral part of the black community a guiding force a walking example as opposed to a walking contradic tion black for the black poet is a way of life as brother marvin x has said the black poet must study his own poems heretofore negro arists and writers there are exceptions were too busy playing artist and writer imitating white boys that is they were too busy with their thing to be intimately concerned with their people today as far as the black poet is concerned black people come first people then art what good or use is art without the people also what good is art if it doesnt communicate with the people black poets write out of a concept of art for peoples sake and not art for arts sake we feel that art for arts sake is an invalid concept and belongs back in greece bc the poet in studying his own poems in essence continually studies himself the black poet is writing to black people and not to whites also in studying his own poetry and the poetry of other black poets the black poet as well as his readers will receive directionpositive direction black poets will live their poems they themselves will be poems black poets do not tell the people the danger of white filth and then dwell in such filth themselves black poets do not tell of the death of dope and other drugs and turn around and use such extremes of death themselves black poets will be examples of their poems and if their poems are righteous the poet will be righteous and he will be a positive example for the black community not another contradictor black poetry not only gives positive direction to the community but shows the people black beauty and black substance our poetry will enable the people to see themselves and as opposed to most scientific data realize that we are universal and are the first people black poets blkartists per se are culture stabilizers bring back old values and introduce new ones black poets are continually defining and redefining present values and will help destroy anything that is detrimental to our advancement as a people black poetry will give the people a future will show visions of tomorrow as leroi jones puts it we must in the present be missionaries of blackness of consciousness actually in the coming chaos any place of knowledge any vessel any collection of black consciousness will create a polarity people then will want to know what to do tell them now as you would then as they run through the streets looking for safety you see black poetry will not necessarily teach the people how to die but will teach the people how to live we must live we must show those who control the world how to live redefine man and put man in his proper perspective in relation to other men and to the world we must move that white boy toward righteousness show him what a human being is and can be show him what sister jewel c latimore calls utopia brothers brothers everywhere and not a one for sale talk for days to blkpeople and tell them that we are universal but define for them as brother ethridge knight does no universal laws of human misery create a common cause or common history that ease black peoplese pains nor break black peoples chains of course everywhere you turn you will be confronted with superidiots who will say with exasperated authority that you are writing protest poetry but we will not swing on the cat not yet at least we will as brother keorapetse kgositsile has done explain what black poetry is i do not write protest poetry my poetry is a love poetry check out any black ghetto in the world listen to the songs that move people to the innovation of all kinds of dances and crazy hollers and tell me if that is not love my poetry is that spirit throbbing with the love of millions of black people all over the world but the impulse is personal black poetry comes out of a love for ones self what is at the bottom a love of ones people how can you really love yrpeople if you dont love yrself and im not talking about narcissism brother kgositsile is more than accurate when he calls his poetry love poetry its the love of ones people that is embodied in his poetry the will to survive as a nation of black people blackness transcends all artificial bordersblackness will speak of and to the third world when norman jordan talks of feeding the lions the black brothers and sisters in africa as well as in mississippi will surely understand that lions visit all the black communities they come into our neighborhood with the sun an army of social workers carrying briefcases filled with lies and stupid grins passing out relief checks and food stamps hustling from one apartment to another so they can fill their quota and get back out before dark as brother leroi jones has said and we own the night we not only own the night but we will take the day and make the day a livable place again a place where people can love and create this atmosphere of beautiful days now exists among blkpoets there is a feeling of cooperation and companionship rather than one of competition black poets are not writing for national book awards and pulitzer prizes black poets are not trying to cut each other up there exists a comradeship and closeness that has never beforeespecially in modern literaturebeen able to grow keeping in mind that these young writers most are under understand that they must complement each other rather than compete against one another thev realize that there is a gross need for the talents of all the blkwriters who can be motivated black poets realize as arthur rimbaud points out that poetry will no longer accompany action but will lead it whereas blk poems will talk to blkpeople and will come like daggers broken brew bottles bullets swift razors from blkhands cutting thru slum landlords and negro dope pushers blk poems will talk to pimps prostitutes and will aid in the destruction of their actions will come like napalm raids over the white house all its weird ways blkpoems will tell of the soul in aretha franklins music tell you that her actions are those of doris day will be sisters burning wigs false eye lashes brothers cutting off processes breaking wine bottles over t honkies heads blkpoems will be gangbangers pulling dope needles out of their arms sticking them into the pushers eyes blkpoems are death to the unrighteous and birth to the truthbringers blk poems are a part of the people an energy source for the peoples lifestyles blkpoems will talk of the kingdoms of africa will speak in zulu swahili will talk in muthafuckas and can you dig it blk poems will be the music blkpeople will dance by will be the weapon used to wipeout nbc cbs abc the myth of the blue eyed soul brother black poems are leroi jones and larry neal is gwendolyn brooks and margaret walker is sonia sanchez and sarah fabio is clarence major and ed spriggs black poetry will be the criticism and poetry of askiamuhammad toure will be ahmed le graham alhamisi and kafi wangara blk poems will be clean communities for black children and will brine mr mrs colored middle class back and will show them where theyve been blkpoems will talk in real acts and not in dreams will be spoken by eugene perkins and s e anderson will pierce the heart and listen to alicia a johnson and larry miller black poems will compliment the art of tom feeling and omar lama will be read to the music of coltrane and sun ra black poems will come from and have the delivering power of brothers slick campbell and ebon dooley margaret danner will talk of africa and carolyn rodgers will give you chicago black poetry will be read in negro digest and the journal of black poetry will come in soulbook and black dialogue will be created in black expressions and liberator with black poetry and other flames of blkart will be the black esthetic as brother larry neal relates it there is no need to establish a black esthetic rather it is important to understand that one already exists i agree with brother neal a blkaesthetic does exist but how does one define it in reference to literature or is it necessary to define it i suggest at this time that we not try however understand that the blkesthetic exists and will continue to be embodied in the work of black artists painters novelists poets etc and will be determined from the forthcoming and existing body of black works dig nobody talked about a white aesthetic until there was an adequate body of work to determine such an aesthetic white critics didnt exploit the joyceian prose until james had put it down nobody talked about the diction of hemingway until the cuban had recorded it on paper you see the white aesthetic if there is such a thing is definable by examining the greater body of western literature black literature as we know it is relatively new this is not to negate the contributions of du bois mckay wright and other blkliterary greats but to realize that these men were primarily addressing themselves to white audiences in the weeks months and years to come black critics will be reading and examining the new black literature and they not white boys will determine what the black aesthetic is as brother clarence major has said we black poets can write poems of pure creative black energy right here in the white west and make them works of art without falling into the cheap marketplace of bull and propaganda and i submit that this is happening from the african dialect of ruwa chiri to the verse of dudley randall from the can you kill nigger of nikki giovanni to the two and three hard lines of mari evans we as black writers have accepted for too long almost without question the assertion that the white way is the right way at last we are able to comprehend that black people see nothing in the same frame of reference as white people not only do we receive and perceive differently but our reaction is noticeably opposed to that of whites check out a whiteoriented fashion show and compare that to the swing of an african fashion showingwe not only can see the difference but feel it rhythm we as blkpoets write out of a concept of self a black thing knowledgeable at all times that mistakes will be made that there will be disappointments and disagree j ments but realizing that these are the actions of black men and black artists we will determine standards of judgment and excellence and no white boys in the pages of the nation the new republic saturday review new york times etc will direct or effect our efforts black people will direct us direction will be a reciprocal process shared between black people black artists and as sister gloria house has said you cant just go and ask anybody man cause dig they just dont know they aint been where you go everyday they aint been through your neighborhood man they cant give you no directions m by sarah webster fabio ho speaks negro w any black man whos on top of whats happening i arrived at this conclusion in an essay published in negro digest which was written originally in as a result of my being questioned in regard to melvin tolsons language and karl shapiros evaluation of that language by the threemember examining board during the oral examination for an ma degree in creative writingpoetry at san francisco state college it began then as a reaction to others acts others questionings others thoughts on the subject of colonization and decolonization in language at the time i focused my attention on negro language without properly defining for myself the term negro action and not reaction is a meaningful response to black people don l lee has a fine poem that warns us of the danger of this it is called react for action at any rate the casual questioning by curious bemused white professors bugged me into seriously beginning to explore the unchartered waters of black awareness for myself now three years later in answer to this same question id say every negro speaks negro to a greater or lesser degree for a black writer however a far more relevant question is who speaks black language what is black in the past a poet could be notoriously negro in one poem and very black in another or black in ideology and perspective but negro in the use of the standard english language or vice versa scratch a negro and you will find a nigger and a potential black man scratch a black man and you may find a nigger and the remnants of a negro negro is a psychological sociological and economical fabrication to justify the status quo in america nigger is the tension created by a black mans attempt to accommodate himself to become a negro in order to survive in a racist country black is the selfhood and soul of anyone with one drop of black blood in america who does not deny himself black is most of the writing of paul laurence dunbar richard wright john o killens margaret walker leroi jones langston hughes although exceptions are found here black is the writings of don l lee and carolyne rodgers black pride and think black broadside press and paper soul third world press lerone bennett jr and hoyt fuller the black community has always knownand it is becoming apparent to the worldthat america wants negroes and niggers but not black people don l lee articulates this america calling negroes can you dance play foot baseball nanny cook needed now negroes who can entertain only others not wanted are considered extremely dangerous john o killens dubbed america the land of the nigger makers james baldwin makes reference to the observation that the negroinamerica is a form of insanity which overtakes white men the negro is a pathology baldwin also has said that there is no negro finally who has not had to make his own precarious adjustment to the nigger who surrounds him and to the nigger in himself being black then is a reaffirmation of selfhood it is a meaningful antidote to white racism it is a move toward deniggerizing the world population of nonwhite people and of humanizing the white people black is biology geography africa west indies ugaunited ghettos of americathe wrong side of the tracks or freeways black belts black is psychology theology philosophy athletic aesthetic politic it is frantz fanon martin_luther_king jr w e b du bois marcus garvey stokely carmichael aaron douglas and charles white muhammad ali and harry edwards adam clayton powell black language is direct creative intelligent communication between black people based on a shared reality awareness understanding which generates interact tion it is a rhetoric which places premium on imagistic renderings and concretizations of abstractions poetic usages of language idiosyncrasiesthose individualized stylistic nuances such as violation of structured syntaxwhich nevertheless hit home and evoke truth it is an idiom of integrated insight a knowledge emanating from a juxtaposition of feeling and fact which form a perspective of now causing perpetual changes of meaning a major question on my spring final examination in afroamerican literature was define black language and give examples of im portant black words considered this a serious difficult question and so did my students at merritt junior college in oakland calif where black awareness is a highly developed reality during the spring black experience the negro was done away with in an effectively eulogized funeral ceremony i must admit an indebtedness to robert decoy whose the nigger bible contained some words over of these derivatives of nigger suggesting a burlesque i accepted the challenge in his word i have made the feeble and sincere attempt to begin your dictionary of niggeramerican words perhaps you or some other who come after will improve add to and complete this particular language have chosen to start with black words rather than negroor nigger words because they are acts of afm firmation rather than reactions at this stage of my research i have upward of words many words have multiple meanings and separate entry listings my dictionary of black language is proving to be very rewarding and gratifying research some of the student definitions and words were that language particular to all biologically black persons it is to them their own means of communication defying explanation a rappingto talk to someone for a period on a subject pertaining to blackness b togetheran adjective describing a persons philosophy and total awareness pertaining to blackness the beautiful way black people communicate with one another a proof if nothing else of a definite and separate distinct culture complex a niggera tag filled with hateandor love used by every black person b brothera unifying greeting in a black community a dialect of english a means by which a black person can comfortably communicate with another black person without the fear of using improper rhetoric because he is correct every time his improvisational words ring true a come down explain stop beating around the bush b jivephony not for real all means of communication used by black people to express themselves not necessarily verbal ones ie the clenched fist among black people means unity for whites it is a symbol of violence and hatred drums music wails hollers a honkologya study of the logic of white thought b dust money a necessary means of communication among black people in order to relate certain aspects of their lives which could never be accomplished through the usage of socalled proper form of anglosaxon english which is unrelated to the black experience in any positive relevant way a language of feeling rather that just thought or talk soul talk forreal downtoearth nittygritty communication and finally the most important question at this stage of black awareness becomes not who speaks black but rather what is black my latest poem explores this mystique black is pigmentation a mirror image of black on black a preference that leans away from fading colors and imitation whites posture an onyourtoes approach to the mazeway of the real world a shoulder squared against whats happeningthe man the hawk bad luck blues a motion a dance a gesture a cool stance a walking that walk talking that talk that is now man position apartness uniqueness a separatism permitting cutting through white irrelevancies to confront basic issues a revolutionary zeal to overthrow oppressive might a moral obligation to change a wrong to a right perspective a clear black eye that peers through the midnight muck of man a deniggerized aspect and value a defiant thrust to wipe out white wash positives of assertive acts affirmations a strong yes not negatives invisibility non entity pride people power people magic soul an exuberance of existence an escalation of self awareness and appreciation gut knowing buried deep in the womb of oppression turning stone to bone to flesh and blood and tears and smiles to love to life pulling pulling a magnet pulling you all the way back home into a thing that is black young black poets by william keorapetse kgositsile here are new voices very different from the ones that were around before different not only in the sense that they are new but essentially because of their attitude and intended purpose precise as tools in the hands of skillful artisans lebert bethune tired of strange ghosts whose cool bones lived on the green furnace of my blood makes a juju of my own as one of the means of baking my destiny to a lullaby he

ancient voice that voice like the pliant red clay she baked she sings the only lullaby she sang me me no care for bakra whip me no care fe fumfum come juju come so i am fashioning this thing my own juju out of her life and our desire out of an old black love i am baking my destiny to a lullaby lebert bethune in juju of my own a slim volume of robust poetry like most of his peers he has been through american institutions of higher learning and come back disillusioned it is no secret today that any honest blackman in any western institution learns sooner or later that there is a calculated denial of his history of his experience by his oppressor he is taught to aspire to western ideals finally he is taught to understand and interpret his historical experience his present existence and his possibilities through white eyes but any time is with us and if we take control to shape our attitudes and reshape our memories that time is always nowour time for the best possible uses of our lives show the chains let them see the chains as object and subject and let them see the chains fall away says leroi jones so there are these voices which attempt to move us in a very specific direction criticizing us here encouraging us there clarifying for us elsewhere you might say that they are voices from the future and they attempt to prepare us because they know that the future will not change to make room for the undesirable the weak will be strengthened if there is any life left in them and memories of past or future or any time are made of very specific selections from your sensibility memories move us the best possible uses of our fives move us and if we are ahead of the times the responsibility is ours to make the present our time lest we be destroyed gloria house celebrates the new day our time look for mind seering into the future with the intensity of their satellites in orbit and you will find it in our heads and for power latent and imminent like the panthers in our bodies we were not made eternally to weep steady slow knowing like ma rainey with her man the forces of time move on to our time and in these days uncovered the great deceits of the mans monstrous mind uprooted his stone monuments to himself destroyed the armies of the psychotic decadent dead a race of devils yes this decadethe sixtieshas produced a different caliber of black poets in america the majority of them have been influenced by negritude and protest poets and writers like cesaire senghor david diop langston hughes claude mckay w e b du bois and others these young poets felt the inadequacy of a purely cultural or artistic selfdetermination because the arguments for it and its artifacts generally boil down to an academic masturbation or deviation a kind of mannerismfornicating with the white eye and then emerging on some stage with western arguments for the validity and glory of a black virginity cesaire though among the negritude poets is above this because he is right there seering into the future with the best of the younger poets in practical terms for instance the younger poets realize that the most beautiful poem senghor can write about the validity of the existence of a glorious black culture without attempting to make the social institutions in senegal actually african actually liberated from france does not even improve the diet of a single undernourished black child anywhere in the world where black people are colonized by caucasians most probably not even in independent senegal this does not mean that negritude andor protest poetry is not valid or functional it is but it is inadequate in terms of its best possible social relevance or uses because it is limited to vision it justifies black art and black experience to a white audience here again aime cesaire is clean because to him negritude was an introductory element a prelude to the reemergence of the blackman on the stage of history the young afroamerican poets whose consciousness was awakened and facilitated by negritude and protest poetry among other influences feel an urgency to make their art as potent a weapon as any in the assertion not birth of their humanism in a poem titled the people burning leroi jones realizes it is choice now like a philosophical problem it is choice now and the weight is specific and personal it is not an emotional decision there facts and who was it said that this is a scientific century jones is not addressing white america or some ideal universal intellect or conscience he is talking to his people about his condition finally theirs because he is his people most of these young writers of this decade after verifying the facts with all the historical evidence necessary emerge strongly convinced of the inhumanity of the western world they come out of western institutions of higher learning strongly convinced that the university in the west is an extension of racism and the socalled cold war which they detest quite often the war is hot past any possible argument for or against it emmett till james powell lumumba malcolm little babies charred while worshipping a western god for the perverted amusement of deranged maniacs and the black poets sensibility explodes the weight becomes specific and personal but the poet does not have explosives for the physical destruction of the west in general and america in particular not yet thus the immediate resort for the black poet is applied poetry he uses his sensibility as ammunition brotherly love virtue construction which by definition embraces and transcends the necessary destruction restoration of human and humane values for the salvation of man now now i see it like this you see da tree ou der its a good shade tree in ne summertime an you know don nobody like to see dey shade tree cud down thus gloria house in her alabama farmers dialectic the alabama farmer like any other colonized person knows that the struggle for liberation is not easy because the oppressor does not want him to be liberated don nobody like to see dey shade tree cud down it is recognition and acknowledgement it leads to resolution it is dialectic after the farmer has looked around and observed some truths we been dat tree for dem folk for a lotta summers for instance he makes the necessary resolution well i cain be no shade tree all my life dat tree got to come down one a dese days aint dat right for gloria the making of a poetry is not escapist exploration or fantasy that could be shattered to smitherings the moment she ventures into the real world of the beauty of concrete human possibilities or the slime of decadent brutes she never leaves actuality her language reflects this the words she chooses to mold and project the images and symbols to celebrate the nature of her revelationsacts are very contemporary that is they come directly from the world around her her sensibility is informed by the pulse of actual not imagined or imaginary people from alabama and all points white of her vision she was down in alabama giving that pulse form direction she lived and worked with communities in alabama she has been in southern jails for attempting to help the people to cud dat tree down she was working with sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee down south when sncc graduated from the civil_rights schools and late in she came to new york to tell a conference of civil_rights lawyers why it was time for sncc to be unconditionally an afroamerican revolutionary movement gloria has lived elsewhere with her eyes open sensitive to her condition as a black woman under white domination as witness direction political advice for young brothers its like where you live man and who lives there with you for example you from harlem yeah well coulda been johannesburg or birmingham alabama you know its all the same im from fillmore that makes us brothers man like we grew up in the same family you dig like every attunedtothetwentiethcentury selfrespecting black man and woman gloria believes in unity and panafricanism and she realizes that young brothersyoung in terms of awareness of the world we live inhave problems of identity especially if they grew up in western democratic societies i mean like if you get shaky about stuff like who you are and where youre going ask somebody who lives near you cause thats where its at man theyll set you straight you cant just go and ask anybody man cause dig they just dont know they aint been where you go everyday very intimate and direct this is education because in any culture education serves to prepare people to be clear about their roles to tap their potential so that their lives can be meaningful so that they can better consolidate their resources and be productive in and useful to their communities the colonial situation is changing the world over the relations between colonizer and colonized are changing in america and elsewhere gloria observes and informs us that they already dance to our drums elemental rhythm of life attuned to the movement of the earth the language in this poem like the period it celebrates is dramatic and pulsates with a divine arrogance it is not however a declaration of war the war is onhas been on this is a song celebrating change the images bathed in the blood that flows when slaves turn men burning plantations be they in newark or kinsangani there is a new chief in the land and all the people will imitate the customs of his tribe and dancing to his heartbeat in his own compound one night at the time they will see his face and they will be astounded that it is black but there are signs of the revolution the young turks of the nation are ours glorias clarity of vision also enables her to see our internal contradictions as a result she can be boldly critical of our mistakes andor hangups as in woman to has the length of one man alone so blurred your view can you leave the sons and daughters of our time motherlessno poems no brown daughter no acts of violence for love squandered on one man you see you have to clearly understand that because we do not have a long active collective memory of popular revolutionary movements because we have endured abuse and all sorts of other perversions so long because we were dehumanized and depersonalized to a point where we didnt really believe that we could rise as powerful men to threaten and damage the power of the oppressor we developed a tendency to put all our hopes in individual courageous men who better reflected the desires and aspirations we were too afraid to own up to to name a few from contemporary history for instance malcolm muhammad ali patrice lumumba kwame nkrumah rap brown the danger in this sort of tendency is that should the given hero die or should he be killed or run out of the country we are left without direction without even the necessary selfconfidence which would mean that we had shifted all our necessary responsibility from our shoulders to those of a given personality this is criminal this makes us traitors to our cause virtually and gloria comments this is not malcolms sister who sits sobbing for the love of one man while the nation groans for birth yes you see gloria house is striving for truth a measure to facilitate her explorations forever digging past pretenses and whatever superficial images of ourselves our world and our possibilities as barbara simmons might say this aint art its real movin there are other forces in glorias company here is a b spellman for instance looking into himself and other similar victims he readily acknowledges the ugliness he sees how stay clear in this place do not eat soap relevance pays there squats mundanity kick it in the nuts its crotch swallow your foot now where are you footless hiss of the hideous you goofed in the tactic ab youre still too quiet break something larger but there is more to us than those hideous tendencies we detest if we are honest a b moved by one of our spiritual heroes john coltrane sings him an impartial review may he have new life like the fall fallen tree wet moist rotten enough to see shoots stalks branches green leaves may the roots grow into his side jones says poetry is music made less abstract and i agree because poems dont mean if they are honest like the honest explorations of music throbbing with life does a charlie parker riff mean anything poems are acts in motion and acts processes which involve action and reaction lead inevitably to other acts confrontation forever moving towards resolving whatever other contradiction and i learned that recently after sufficient soulsearching a b spellman left new york to be involved in more direct concrete and relevant acts in black communities in the south listen a little more often to coltrane and then there is edward spriggs whose poetry is adequately representative of the sentiments of the younger afroamerican poets edward s spriggs is new york editor of black dialogue a meeting olace for voices of the black communitywherever that community may exist spriggs states unequivocally my forefathers brought upon this continent phvsical strength intelligence creativity beauty humanism an unparalleled faith and more only the physical strength and that faith has been allowed to function in this consciousless place our intelligence our creativity our beauty and our humanism must be forced now by us upon the universeupon ourselves even spriggs argues that anvthing representative of america as she exists now is a threat to keen the blackman in perpetual bondage psychological and physical even the symbols of american liberty must be destroyed because white americas concept of liberty and justice is a perversion that must be irrevocably shoved out of our existence the statue of libertv must go that bitch must vacate our minds spriggs has no explanations to make to the white world his dialogue is strictly with black people if he incites excites instructs or entertains he does so to and for black people his ability to look at the mirror of life boldly and shamelessly his sensibilitys functioning as an inevitable receptacle of his peoples collective soul makes him one of our spokesmen he is hopefully not preoccupied with merely analyzing and articulating our misery wright baldwin killens and many otherstheir shortcomings asidehave done that fairly competently already he looks at america and sees in her ghettos all of the material conveniences of the western world he observes for instance in a short photographic poem on harlem the jewowned bars barbecue joints and many other enterprises where black people live in squalor finally he reveals that the only thing owned by black people in harlem is death this is the american experience which molded his sensibility he lives in a period during which millions of people are murdered at random for the preservation of american dollarism sharpeville vitenam santo domingo harlem watts detroit newark and many more places responsibility to see his people move from all things south imposes itself upon him with an unrelenting passion he apparently has a black conscience chauvinism it depends on what the reader of spriggs relates to after all even the oppressor taught him that cleanliness begins at home he is far from being sentimental he expresses the collective soul of the ghetto and tries to give direction because he is inherently part and parcel of the moving black mass he does not appeal to the conscience of white america because white america has no conscience instead he appeals to his people to pray not for the poet saints pray instead saints for his critics the critics of course are the white murderers who want to control everything including the black poets creativity but spriggs creativity cannot be checked by adolescent fascists disguised as literary critics because he is the bearer of truth spriggs asserts a poet must would give truth substance form truth needs a second career so crack the other side black poet that it be felt that it be looked at into evidently poets like spriggs know the truth is essentially the poets business spriggs also believes that after the poet has stood truth on her feet again unveiled unadulterated a lot of cleaning up remains to be done the western white man has made the world a filthy place because of the damage done by the western white man the blackman is even alienated from himself so in order that the job ahead be done efficiently black poets must make sons quick using magic substances black poets must make soul anew must crack the pods let the semen fly must carve epitaphs on their volume numbers spriggs seems to have undergone a psychological and creative rebirth he got rid of the western bourgeois esthetic he is then a modern day witchdoctor whose art and expression are a way of life pulsating with love of life and love since he cannot relate to it he rejects the white frame of reference he was programmed into from the very first day he went to kindergarten he seems to have established a new frame of referenceghettooriented because the black community in a whitedominated society is what he directly relates to spriggs language is free is full of the free ghetto cadence and colorful beauty is afroamerican is delicately sensitive even in the midst of his unrelenting fury is mystic is magical is movingnot in search of but in the assertion and restoration of truth is present like the condition that molded his mind truth is presenthappening languagepulse is heart is myth is vatic is poetry poetry like any other art form is meaningless that is has no use beauty and good inseparableunless it be a specific act actual as dance or childbirth carved bleeding from history our experience tears scorched to deep tracks on the mine laborers back recording the national epitaph walls and what shapes people your memory clarity is not a thought process but a way of life there are many many more young men and women with a sense of mission across these united states you might run into some of them in small magazines like negro digest soulbook black dialogue the journal of black poetry freedomways liberator presence africaine transition the back issues of black orpheus and the new african yet others you might run into only at poetry readings in harlem or newark or some other black community across this country these are transitional men and women moving to the elemental rhythms of our time transitional because they are trying in our time through their rhythms to deniggerfy us to bathe our pulse in revolutionary passions attempting as leroi jones would sing to look into black skulls and teach white people their death but before one can be most effectively instrumental in freeing a people he must first himself be free so that he strives to assert and live up to what he has and its possibilities not what he in frustration desires to have one looks forward to a period when the majority of these young poets abandon mannerism and get directly involved in very concrete community action when the state of black desire becomes an everyday act to satisfy that desire and split the skies with human and humanistic possibilities they will be free then like their rhythms and so will be the rest of us the rhythms coming directly from the way we live then we will join nina simone and sing and now we are one let my soul rest in peace at last it is done my soul has been renewed thet will help you to believe you are learning now about the american revolution the declaration of independence the founding fathers and the constitution and each morning in class you place your hand over your heart and pledge allegiance to the flag and to country of your birth and it all has meaning for you you are an american and that proud heritage represented by the events and documents and words you are learning is your heritage but soon you will begin to learn other things things which inevitably will leave you in a quandary things which will force you to call into question the meaning of the events and documents and words you have treasured you will learn that for you the heritage in which you have had pride also has emptiness and the knowledge will break your heart we who are older who have traveled the way you must go have not yet found a method of sparing you that heartbreak we want you to believe what you are learning now for the passions and the principles which brought into being the american revolution the declaration of independence and the constitution represent humankind at its noblest we want you to believe in these things even as we concede in sadness that you will need strength beyond what we can give you to hold on to your belief in the world that awaits you 10494 100 s а v q e ףv 9 l c
