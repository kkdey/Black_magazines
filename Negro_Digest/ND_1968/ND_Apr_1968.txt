black theatergo home
if a new black theater is to be born sustain itself and justify its own being it must go home go home psychically mentally esthetically and i think physically now what does all that mean first off what do i myself mean by a new black theater i mean the ritualized reflection and projection of a unique and particular way of being bom of the unique and particular conditioning of black people leasing time on this planet controlled by whitemen and having something to do with the breaking of that leasingsyndrome a theater emerging from artists who realize that for black people of this world and specifically this country every quote universal human malady dilemma desire or wonder is by the heat of the pressure of whiteracism compounded and enlarged agitated and aggravated accented and distilled to make that omnisuffusing grinding sense of being we once called the blues but might now just term blackness from this peculiar and particular extradimension of being of experiences of conditioning will come the kind of theater im looking for out of the fact that something as universal as the innerdrive and desire for success takes on a different shade another prickpoint when it is beneath a black skin there are some strange bilevel goals some other further obstacle considerations involved out of the fact that even love vibrates to these ultraearthy subterranean accents love for family for woman for friend for self are all touched somehow somewhere by this infrashadow and it is from this deep shadow that will come this new theater i am seeing come in many brilliant new forms of enlightenment illumination it will be a theater having to do with love of ones self and ones personal national and international family with wariness and hatred of ones personal national and international enemies with ideally points as to how to break their grip and splatter their power now let me stay right in here a minute i want to make sure i get across at least some hint of all the levels i see here try a couple more parables examples similies or whatever allright so lets take the french film black orpheus a sweet bright touching thing just good to see a woman like that in full color but to make it afroamerican orpheus there would have to be some extending and deepening of dimensions understand me a writer in the new black theater might want to make the hell the death the girls going into the whiteworld rejecting not only orpheus but all other cats and things black that would be the hell and orpheus going to get her back with just courage and con and a song would really be some thing wouldnt it and how could he not look back at the past at the promises of the devil yeh deep stuff tragic and neither shaw oneill nor any of those other great ones could write it not within this level of blackness im talking about i can almost feel some of you thinking racism pure racism well i dont know now all the universal implications messages of the tale are still there what this imaginary writer has done is to put hell up on earth where it belongs and say that it has something to do with rejecting your own people and images for other people and images and if there is racism in it it only makes it more validly of this time and of this world your fire driving others fires out of your brain now that little adaptation points at just one level of what im visualizing but there will be so many other levels coming simultaneously levels of love and joy and strength and courage like how did bighearted bigbellied george jones this elevatoroperator pullmanporter foundryflunky keep that deep clean laughter goingraise all those kids and keep that strong groovy woman swept all those years on it how did he do it how come everybody in the barbershop poolroom workhouse and everywhere is glad to see him coming turning to him to warm their psychic and spiritual hands how why who what cant you see him in a bluelight sitting up on the side of the bed plotting next weeks billdodging and billpaying with all of them asleep except maybe her lying there touching his back now and then telling him to get some rest but in the morning with still no answers in sight hes got the right glowing laugh of confidence to send those kids on out ready to run through those prejudice teachers and all that other crapto look for something he never saw now how does he do that he knows whats happening hes been through a thousand hunky overseers on a thousand poisonous jobs hes had to dodge and stall the buzzards so long he can smell em a month away now how hes some huge terrific soul stretching his lowceilinged cage all out of shapedefeating it even while it kills him a peculiar and particularly tragichero made both tragic and heroic by his way with a particularly peculiar poisonous situation getting george jones and that deep resilient lady of his and their indigo moments on stage is being in another level of the new black theater so many levels all levels because there is no personal style or hangup or revelation that cant be worked out within and through the stances and situations of black people through the questions and answers in the rightnow relevance frequency we must tune ourselves and our audiences into in order to nurture race self and art a writer coming this way won t lack in his work any of those universal everyone screams about not if he has any in him if you look for em youll find em even in the comic strips but he will become involved in the projection of a certain uniqueness that is his hardearned birthright now any of you who know about writing or about speechmaking probably realized that that was the return of the bridge back there that stanza ending in that riff ofrace self art that brings me back to where i started where  said that if this theater is to be it mustpsychically mentally esthetically and i feel even physicallygo home im sure you know now what i mean by going home psychically and mentally but just in case let me try to run a short quick summary by psychically i mean coming away from your duespaying to all those outside influences and going into the real black you by way of those places people and experiences which began and had the most to do with the shaping of what is now yourselfmean making works theater out of that and in doing it extending and validating that particular psychic by mentally i mean understanding that you and the experiences of you are in time and history collective repet tons have been repeated and multiplied many times so as artists you are to try to find the terms and the pictures which will most simply clarify those experiences and that knowledge for the yous who do not or could not understand what is or was happening to you and to future yous who will need to be warned and directed in terms from inside that level we call blacknessfor it is within that level that most of the added making or breaking weight comes going home esthetically will follow naturallv after those first two m stepssince your esthetics come out of your mental and psychic environment so i wont eo into the demand for new dynamics for a new intensity of language and form that the material and the desired atmosphere will make on you except to say that the further you go home the more startlingly new and black the techniques become musicians are pointing that out to us now going home physically with the new theater means just that probably i should have started here for this new theater must be housed in sustained and a judged by and be a useable projection of and to a black community the community itself will be the theater and the black artists house of drama like a weirdly fixed and pointed lookingglass a lightprism casting warnings directions fruitful memories and marvelous imaginings on the walls of the doomed or soon to be recreated buildings right there in the community are your materials your situations and conflictsrelevant and powerful when you stand on those streets feeling the human whimpering going on under the beasts muzzle when the myriad poisons are part of your natural everyday elements the needs will either come bursting out of your pens onto your stages or theyll drive you sick with your own faggot cowardice the need to displace and replace pale and dark villains and heroes ideas and concepts images and symbols the need for defined and dramatized hugelydrawn clearly shown walking and talking details as to how to organize community county nation world for a shattering attack against the most voracious powermachine the world has ever known details not stunning poetic generalities details details should be moving around those stages in all kinds of explicit images huffing and puffing and working themselves out of the killing situationsor showing why they cannot pictures of who and what was the past how it was called and who answered and why it all went down who were those heroes the kids have got to know of and believe in before they can believe that you or any other black man has anything to tell them what were the betrayals how does judas look when hes black detailed pictures of who and what is doing the killing now and how itawesome as it might seem can be maneuvered into deathtraps all the while youre singing about that woman that buddy those personal artpromises you made to yourself all and any of it placed right in the context in which you found it and from which you can only free it through direct confrontation  that is americas ballcutting racist vise youve grabbed every piece of beauty thought insight and style youve ever achieved in your life while dodging that crap and to put it out of your work before it is out of your life is making a lie of your artwhich is nothing but your life thoughts feelings seeings imaginings doings sent out to others with an imposed reorder you will never have a theater an art a life really representative of the soulbeats and desirelines of you and your kind until you and your kind have come together and pooled desires plans resources and capabilities to throw olf the jailers the people the communities are trapped in both unconscious suicide and subtle dedicated genocide you have a tool that might be able to help whatre you going to do go out on a bridge halfway between realities and blow to yourself or serenade the downtown people and catch the pennies they throw at your feet i hope not speaking of penniesand we have tothere is also a definite practical economical reason for the new theater going physically to the black communities that is that broadway doesnt want your blackness wasnt designed or intended for it definitely doesnt want any strange new forms inspired by that very blackness she is a contented fat white cow if you can slip in and milk her for a minutewell then more blackpower to you brother but im telling youits a weird price shes asking she wants you to be a singing hyena dancing on the graves of yourself and everyone you know serious things dramas are things that come from some other country some other century and even then are best set in a madhouse and quote blackcomedy has nothing to do with afroamericans broadway cannot support you brothers and sisters it would be against their interests if youre thinking that offbroadway is a haven think again it is finally as a perfect example of what america would have its artists involved in a zoo with a carnival where the animals and the freaks play delightfully curiously shockingly with lights colors words forms gestures always with some ingrown aspect of themselves never with anything in the outerworld should any relevance be uttered or implied it is usually done so with the utmost obscurity now and again i have to admit something disturbs that tranquil scene down there something real and relevantrelated to other peoples livesseeps in then everyone does a doubletake and goes back wondering if maybe something could really be starting down there after all but its usually just something or someone healthy getting ready to breakout of there nothing to be alarmed about wont happen often to round off my thinking on offbroadway i tell you that art for arts sake is incest and the offsprings of that are usually strange and feeble we black people desperately need a healthy natural artform art coming from an intercourse with life our lives as we have and must live them in order for our art theater to provide this for us it must become an organic functioning part of our communities as black artists we must go home in every way go wherever it is we most feel indigenous and organic and therefore a natural observer and commentor it is there that our talents must pay dues and spend dividends the communities the people can sustain assist and inspire us to essential and brilliant levels in our new black theater our new visions but only if we assist and inspire them to the same levels in the new black theater of their living to new visions of their lives
nearly everyone knows the story of old sam sam came out of harlem and he worked on the same job for  years he was a hard worker but he always took mondays off one day the boss told him sam you are the best worker i have but why cant you get to work on mondays sam answered boss if you could get colored on friday nights and have as much fun as we do you couldnt get to work on mondays either now all of this is amusing but there is something to be noted here sam was in the same place where he was  years ago and in looking around at the position of the black man in the theater i am wondering if he isnt in the same place he has been in for  years and like sam he may be having fun on weekends but he is being insidiously destroyed it takes no genius to realize that a theater is as strong as its playwrights there has never been a truly great theater without playwrights the greeks had sophocles and aeschylus the british had shakespeare the french had moliere and the irish had synge and ocasey and the american theater of the s had oneill barry and sidney howard black people had fun sometimes i suspect that black people have had too much fun they have run their mouths while white folks were organizing no one has had the nerve to say it out loud but i suspect very strongly that one of the reasons the great african civilizations fell was because their intellectuals did more talking than writing and the children of those great civilizations continue to talk at any rate the realization that any theater needs playwrights led to my joining the late great actress rose mcclendon in organizing the negro peoples theater in  two years later after miss mcclendons death my late wife muriel rahn joined me in establishing  the rose mcclendon players we drew around us such talented people as ossie davis jane white ed cambridge austin briggshall frederick oneal dooley wilson canada lee george norford eugene grigsby fred carter and loften mitchell we initiated a policy of doing only plays written by black playwrights and we did pretty well five years were poured into our activities in the basement of the mt morris park library at  west  street we produced fifteen plays some oneactors some fulllength some were better than others but at least three showed truly great promise on the part of their authors unfortunately those three authors long ago ceased to write plays they became press agents reporters and school teachers for they had to eat and no one was buying a black playwrights work in those daysunless he turned out a green pastures harlem or some such trivia that appealed to broadways white theatergoers no one is buying black playwrights work today eitherincluding black producers indeed a curious thing has happened this past year while people sang of the negro theatergroundswell exactly one black american ronald milner saw his play produced in new york city the nowdestroyed new lafayette theater produced mr milners whos got his own black producers are outmarshaling the marshal plan they have produced the work of a european and now theyre going to australia and africato any place but home to put it bluntly black producers are allies of the power structure in terms of keeping black people in their customary roles namely court jesters in the american drama it seems that neither white nor black america wants to deal with the realities of the black experience on this continent frankly i began to worry when i saw those foundations giving out huge chunks of money i said then that those who got the money were going into a lot of mental gymnastics over how to keep black playwrights off the boards i kicked myself told myself i was getting old and that those fellows would produce plays by black americans well i am sorry that i was right in the first place someone wrote recently that the negro theater is a sometime thing it is and it will ever be thus unless somebody writes for it there are highsounding motives and mottoes around today indicating that black people are making their way in the theatertheir own way the new york times recently devoted nearly a full page of its sunday theater section to the pronouncements of douglas turner ward author of the fine longrunning double bill day of absence and happy ending at the st marks playhouse which is now the home of the newly founded and funded negro ensemble company any  day you can pick up a daily and find a lengthy piece on the life and times of the negro theater these pronouncements all say pretty much the same thing that the afroamerican theater needs special playsplays that communicate to a special audience the black audience the premise is that it takes a black american to really write for the black american theater douglas turner ward said as much in his new york times interview some months ago to stanley kaufman former times theater critic obviously the ford foundation has no objections to this premise since it gave to mr ward and his partner actorproducer robert hooks nearly  to form a negro ensemble company where black actors could be trained and molded into an ensemble theater group all of this is very good but i have a feeling that afroamerican playwrights should be working right along with actors directors and others in the group and i dont mean student actors and directors exclusively i mean professional afroamerican playwrights to write material for the professional actors in the company much is happening to black people everywhere today where are the playwrights to get some of this downthis black comedy or dramaand on our stages now what any novice in theater knows is that not all playwrights start out writing hits more often he misses before he hits but what is important is the opportunity to develop his craft right along with the actor if nobody ever presents his works he will never know his weaknesses he has to see his creations and find out for himself where he made mistakes he must go through the same trialanderror method which makes the actor outstanding in the process therefore of developing an afroamerican or negro ensemble company whose basics are not only communication with the black audience but communicating blackness to a white audience it is difficult to understand why black playwrights are not carried along in the overall development of the negro ensemble company true mr ward  is a prolific writer and a solid pro but the scheduled plays for the negro ensemble companys first season suggests that mr ward and mr hooks are not only fresh out of plays but that they are fresh out of playwrights in the latter case this just isnt so the negro ensemble company has adapted ray lawlors summer of the seventeenth doll which had a fairtomiddling broadway run a few years ago to a negro locale on the levee gracious me this harks back to the thirties and forties of the hot mikado carmen jones and my dartin aida only now the nec is substituting legitimate plays for musicals after  years of watching and participating in this kind of thing to earn a living i am not only disappointed in mr ward and mr hooks i am shocked no i am disgusted why anyone would think these gentlemen are a couple of starving black actors without a theater to their names hustling next weeks rent but that just isnt so these two guys are rich man theyve got nearly half a million bucks of the mans money and when thats gone im sure the man will be back with more well cry discrimination if he doesnt after all its popular to give black folks money these days its chic compounding the insult is the injury i endured by watching song of the lusitanian bogey by peter weiss who needs the nec to do his plays like he needs a hole in the  head mr weiss whose marat sade and the investigation were weirdly successful after a fashion will probably come through in his usual style and please the critics this wont help negro playwrights and the announced daddy goodnessof which i know nothing will probably give black playwrights a chance to see what richard wright might have accomplished as a playwright had he lived of course mr wright didnt write daddy goodness he merely translated and adapted it why does the nec select these plays to do when there are many afroamerican playwrights walking around with pretty good scripts under their arms looking for producers i can think of at least four offhand in whom the nec could invest  as playwrightsinresidence have a season of four plays that would say something to black and white people but especially to black people i shall name them without their permission they are alice childress who had a fine offbroadway play at the greenwich mews theatre some seasons back entitled trouble in mind loften mitchell who has just written the greatest book on the negro theatre ever published black drama and who had an excellent play at the greenwich mews a few seasons back entitled a land beyond the river ossie davis whose purlie victorious not only had a broadway run but was also made into a movie neither of which made him rich because of his content and william branch whose a wreath for udomo is a classic and telling statement of an african dictators downfall based on a novel by the noted african author peter abrahams all of these men and this woman have had successes but with no foundations to keep them flush mitchell and branch did receive guggenheim awards of  each some years back and they came up with good works now that the nec has made its first big mistake i hope a second season will afford it an opportunity to go about the business of doing what it should have been doing from the very first nec does have the work of the noted african playwright wole soyinka on its schedule but i think it is ironic that the group had to look to european australian and african sources it is indeed so ironic that  years later old sam and i remain in the same spot taking mondays off sam doesnt know it but i think i do while were having fun on those weekends the american power structure is taking care of business and its business is to see that we black people stay in the same place for another  years
black people are rapidly learning that they ¦  must define their own  terms how terms are defined determines how events are judged and how questions are answered for instance in catholic schools the religious upheavals initiated by martin luthers dispute with the pope are called the protestant revolution whereas in public schools the same series of events are called the protestant reformation the term which you accept determines how you feel about the events discussed a term much in vogue for discussion nowadays is black theater there is a general agreement that there is a definite need for a strong and viable black theater in this country and as a result groups have been springing up through the country the recentlylaunched new yorkbased negro ensemble company is one group which lays claim to filling the void existing in the black theater world financed with a  oneyear grant from the ultraestablishmentarian ford foundation the company has already completed one of the four plays which are scheduled for its first season at the time this is written the play song of the lusitanian bogey by german playwright peter weiss received generally favorable reviews from the press and many people hailed this as new black theater but to many interested persons the question remains is the negro ensemble company really black theater can a theater group financed by the ford foundation produce black theater in his recently published book crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruse provides a definition of black theater which most black people find acceptable my own standards for a black theater would be one where negroes themselves would finance the institution and man all the technical and administrative posts using this definition as a guideline the answer would have to be notrue black theater cannot be financed by this countrys ford foundations all critics of the company dont agree completely with mr cruses position of course they are not critical of the company for the acceptance of the grant but for the way it is being used by douglas turner ward the artistic director and robert hooks the executive director of the ensemble company actordirector ernie mcclintock says they have the money ford cant take it back the worst they can do is not renew it they could have used the oneyear grace to really experiment and give exposure to young black playwrights instead they are using all wellestablished playwrights who really dont need the exposure critics are especially incensed over the selection of plays for their first season besides weiss play which depicts the horrors of portuguese colonialism in africa the company is doing summer of the seventeenth doll by australian playwright ray lawler which has been transposed from its original australian setting to the world of migratory black sugar cane workers in louisiana the third play is kongis harvest the latest by nigerian playwright wole soyinka which deals with the corruption in i an african dictatorship and the final work is daddy goodness a richard wright adaptation of an original french play by louis sapin this play has to do with peoples need for a kind of messiah and the ways in which this need can be exploited critics feel that there is no excuse for the companys not scheduling one play by a black american playwright based on a black american theme ward answers these criticisms with the explanation that the companys objective is to promote plays which have a relevance to black life whether written by black or white american or foreign playwrights he contends that the selected plays fulfill that aim technically he is correct but the question still remains why does a group which lists as one of its aims a desire to provide a new platform for the exposure of the works of young black actors and playwrights not have one play by a young black playwright in its opening season the explanation that the directors of the company looked but couldnt find a suitable play is met with skepticism in the black artistic community a second bone of contention between the negro ensemble company and many of its potential supporters is its location in the east village rather than in one of the black communities especially since ward himself has been quoted as saying that for a negro playwright the need is for an audience of other negroes in his new york times article american theatre for whites only ward wrote of the need for a theater of permanence continuity and consistency providing the necessary homebase for the negro artist to launch a campaign to win his ignored brothers and sisters as constant witnesses to his endeavors he also wrote that the black playwright needed not necessarily an allblack audience to the exclusion of white but for the playwright a black audience is certainly his primary audience the first persons of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his interest and purpose be best perceived by others it would seem to follow that a playwright expressing such sentiments would locate his theater in one of the large black communities where the type of audiences which he described is readily available ward didnt do so and his reasoning is that were not here on the lower east side because its the lower east side were here because we got a threestory building complete with theater that fulfills our needs moreover we can be reached by negroes from all over the metropolitan area not just harlem bedfordstuyvesant is only  minutes away and jersey city  minutes we want to build a black audience throughout the area he also feels that black people will come to the st marks playhouse to see good relevant theater using the success of his oneact plays day of absence and happy ending in attracting an almost  per cent black audience  people as a case in point these statements hardly quiet his critics who wonder how many black people would attend the theatre if it was located in their community and they could just walk in from the streets pay their money and see good relevant theater the question remains can the term black theater be used to define a theater located outside the black community the negro ensemble company says yes its critics say no the companys use of whites in key positions has also brought it under fire from important segments of the black community gerald krone is administrative director paul mann is director of training for the professional company alfred geller is legal counsel and joseph m gottfried is accountant these are some of the whites who hold positions which many feel should have beenand could have beenheld by blacks the critics are especially soured by manns appointment as director of professional training feeling that this very sensitive post must be filled by a black director if the theater is directed towards a black audience wards reply to this line of criticism is that ive been a negro militant for years and i share their anger i also have my own ideas about practicality and they do not eliminate the use of any talent to fulfill any other talent well said but is he talking about black theater the negro ensemble company despite its claims is not black theater it may be interesting theater it may be good theater but to call it black theater would be considerably stretching the definition of black theater given by harold cruse a definition which i accept there is no consistent philosophy of cultural nationalism directing the actions of its leaders douglas turner ward and robert hooks who themselves are not known as cultural nationalists they are very talented and even their critics had little criticism of the caliber of the professional acting company about which it is generally agreed that the performances in bogey were excellent and in a highly professional ensemble style but those of us who are looking for a black theater will have to look elsewhere right into the black communities realizing that if we want true black theater we will have to pay for it and sustain it by our resources and skills
recently i received in the mail a big fat bulky questionnaire from the committee on human rights concerning discrimination in the theater now that was bad enough but a few evenings later i went bouncing out of my apartment as i do every saturday night or early sunday morning to purchase the new york times  hurried back to quickly glance through the newsy theater section and the intellectual magazine section to find out if there was anything interesting enough to read i could then determine whether i would stay in and relax or go to the movies i had just given up on the drama section i briskly began thumbing through the magazine section when what to my wandering eyes should appear but a big fat juicy article about us oh boy oh boy what a pleasant surprise out the window goes all plans for the movies i pour me a glass of milk take out cookies and make myself comfortable so i can really relax and enjoy what mr kerr has to say about us poor neglected problem children    the negro actor well its about time i say but the more i read the less comfortable i become and the more i read the less cozy my apartment becomes and the more i read the more sour my milk becomes and the more rancid my cookies seem to taste until finally i scream being the method actress that i am stop stop stop oh please stop i cant take any more of this meaningless chitchat this wasted misdirected energy first the questionnaire and now this article that did it its just too too much for one week i mean really    the white establishment is making it impossible for us to stay sane after the emotional outburst the irony of the whole ridiculous situation hit me and i simply plopped down in my not so cozy chair and laughed now by the time i had finished going through all my emotional changes the last feature of the movie had begun and there i was stuck at home with my article on one side and my questionnaire on the other what to do    what to do    what to dothe outlook is incurably blue in case you are curious as to the contents of my big fat bulky questionnaire and after all you are entitled to know what caused the initial discomfort it goes like this dear actor the enclosed questionnaire is confidential and is aimed towards determining what kind of employment situation exists for actors with racial andor ethnic minority backgrounds in order to explore conditions relating to the work experience of the professional actor and to find out if the hiring policies of theatrical employers are changing and what the rate of that change is we must have your cooperation in gathering information that will give us facts please read the questionnaire over carefully bear in mind that its purpose is to determine   is there an employment problem in the theatrical field broadway offbroadway television motion pictures television commercials and industrials for qualified negro puerto rican japanese chinese indian etc actors  need i go any further now i ask you is this questionnaire really necessary all one has to do is turn on the television go to any neighborhood movie or buy a ticket to any broadway play and the answers are readily available without the need for any questionnaire after all this time centuries and i do mean centuries how can whites still be naive enough to think that the racial inequalities of show business and on a larger scale of this country can be solved by writing still more articles essays questionnairesand even bookson the problem of the negro in america come now who are we kidding at this point in our history there are certainly enough books and periodicals both for and against integration most of which in their own individual styles clearly define the racial problems in america books which precisely state why all this happened how it happened why it continues to go on and even solutions to the problem and if one refuses to read books on this touchy subject one has the alternative of taking a trip that is those who are brave enough to any ghetto in any city of this country and see for yourself actually for all the friends of black people who constantly ask what do you want or in some cases if they are ultrasophisticated what do they want or why do they hate us so it wouldnt be a bad idea to sponsor guided tours once or twice a day through each harlem of this country heavily protected of course and if it accomplishes nothing else at least we might be able to eliminate those stupid questions my point is simply this there is no excuse any more for this childlike naivete concerning the racial issues in this country and on a more specific level in the theater black writers have more than done their share toward providing enlightenment if they would all leave their typewriters and not write another sentence for another decade there would still be enough material to read and digest the white american has proven himself over the vears to be the m most cunning calculating shrewd and contriving human ever created he spend hours upon hours every day mastering the ability to maintain andor gain power and will go to any lengths to achieve this power so how can he expect me to believe that the same mastermind who created the hydrogen bombs and send missiles into outer space this same brilliant mind cannot understand the simple issues involved in eradicating racial inequalities this shrewd mind instead expends vital creative energy trying to throw america offtrack by sending out banal questionnaires and writing juvenile articles concerning the negro question how mr kerr one of americas most outstanding theater critics could reach his conclusions in his article in the new york times magazine am  a negro or am i an actor is absolutely mystifying to me does he really think after all this time actors are dumb enough to interpret this concern to mean he really wants to do something positive to eliminate the condition tm afraid not instead the article will be read and people will say isnt that a shame and again life will go on actually on the surface the article seemed intelligent terribly honest and extremely courageous it would appear that he has tremendous insight concerning the dilemma confronting black people in the american theater today he asked many legitimate questions which showed a total awareness of the existing situation however in the process of answering those very questions thereby arriving at definite conclusions and proposing definite solutions he left the negro actor either totally confused bewildered or completely disappointed relative to what he must do about increasing his employment opportunities on broadway lets look at the situation closely as stated up to this date integration has been the black actors total concern on broadway in order to provide more jobs for himself in the already established field of entertainment he has picketed satin marched and negotiated new laws this still has not helped him to accomplish his goals because he now finds himself in a position where he must turn down many of these very jobs so it would seem the problem is far more complex than simply hiring more negro actors now the question is what type of jobs can heor should heaccept perhaps the answer to this question should be as long as the white establishment is in complete control as long as it determines the interpretation of the roles as long as they dictate to us what the behavior of the character must be as long as they reap the majority of the material profit the black actor accepting roles in such vehicles will only help maintain the status quo andor in some cases even retard his already established position why when white people determine what image black people should reflect on stage they usually perpetuate out of ignorance antiquated cliches these writers and directors generally have no real knowledge of the true history and psyche of black people and therefore their creativeor historical choices of what the black actor is suppose to represent are inaccurate or unreal the black actor is therefore being used as a pawn for the whites own personal gain this is particularly true in musicals where we are most blatantly exploited always singing dancing carefree happygolucky got no worries got no cares creatures since contrary to what mr kerr says the theater does play a major role in setting standards and values the black artist who continues to accept these type roles will justify and also enablewhite writers to continue to write them and white producers to continue to make money from them and can you blame them and white audiences will continue to carry a distorted image back home with them as long as this prevails there will be no next step forward if producers writers anddirectors intentions were honorable when dealing with black material on or offbroadway they would at least solicit the services of black consultants andor assistant directors they would hire black personnel on an administrative or policymaking level and please dont raise the issue of qualifications today there exist many victims of the theater s fear of hiring qualified black personnel i am one such victim as one big producer said to another what is she going to be some kind of black thermostat it seems no one is willing to share his control even if it would mean a better more accurate production examples hallelujah baby on broadway and all regional and repertory theater companies lincoln center included how can there be progress as long as every decision made and every job obtained in the theater is from a white point of view and must be accepted on white terms no matter how big a black actor may become his image is still fixed lockedin and he is constantly used as some kind of oddity or bastard commodity as a black actress as long as this condition prevails i can merely look forward to playing demanding roles such as prostitute maid andor every now and then just for local color of course some form of exotic perhaps a role in one of the classics however if im really lucky and can survive the frustrations of this business when im old and gray i can look forward to playing a strong forceful ballcutting matriarch and the white theater will continue to profit from my unique negritude at least i will be secure in specifically knowing the types and roles i will or will not be allowed to play i will not be allowed to grow from an ingenue into a leading lady into a character actress heavens no thats for white folks only i will rather grow from a hard cold prostitute into a hard cold matriarch only two dimensions its really amazing to what lengths playwrights and directors go to in order to make their black characters fit the stereotype one could never imagine a black actress playing a woman or even a lady who is eitheror warm wise sensitive intelligent loving puritanical helpless longsuffering confused or perhaps a fickle human being consciously or unconsciously really its irrelevant white people have convinced themselves and as always when they convince themselves they usually convince most blacks too that being black of necessity narrows ones scope therefore being black means being limited its like putting on some form of strait jacket its some kind of freakish quality which in all theatrical cases necessitates that you be handicapped a basket case and it seems that as long as black performers are hired to entertain white america their creative talents will be dealt with in this extremely limited fashion actually all that being black means is that one has a specific frame of reference or point of view just as any white american russian irish english jewish greek spanish chinese or any other race of people have and isnt that where all creative experiences begin from a specific ethnic or environmental base blackness is something within not something without therefore being black merely gives the artist a specific base or starting point whereby he may relate his life experiences to an audience in his own unique life style    to quote mr kerr we live in a time of theatrical naturalism for approximately  years our plays have become more and more photographic more literally faithful to the details and appearance of life as it is lived statistically settings must look exactly as houses and apartments look behavior in the theater must duplicate precisely behavior outside the theater whether we call this realism or naturalism doesnt matter what matters is that we now expect to hear and see in the theater a close duplication of what we see and hear in our homes in our offices on our sidewalks whites do not see many negroes in their homes nor do negroes see whites in theirs not socially not as young brides not as reallife leading ladies whites do not see many negroes in their offices at least not after they have passed the reception desks general experience knows no casual interchange to place such a casual interchange upon the stage as though it were real when we know it is not iswithin naturalismto falsify nature the image doesnt persuade it kicks back therefore one can reach the conclusion that white audiences will not support an integrated play or an allnegro play which does not coincide with their way of life their way of thinking but the fact of the matter is that the united states is a mixed society it isnt a white society its a whiteandblack society this we can also both agree on now please let us not confuse the discomforts caused by sexual involvements with those of socalled casual interchange one has nothing to do with the other and perhaps we should leave the bedroom alone and begin thinking and using our energies toward developing a dialogue between blacks and whites which will enable us to have a more realistic picture as to how and where we do exist and how this knowledge can be used in the theater  in essence anyone who doesnt come in at least casual contact with a black these days is an exception rather than the rule and he should immediately do something about his plight perhaps mr kerr was referring to people who occupy the orchestra seats on broadway they cause broadway to be as sterile and superficial as it is perhaps if broadway were geared toward the people we could have more realistic and meaingful theater this then seems to be the reason theater is in the predicament it is today broadway sticks to the status quo in order to appease these orchestra seaters with their rigid fantasized ethics perhaps this whole system of theater should be destroyed because in having to conform to this oversentimental highly romanticized view of life it is killing the artist this decadent sense of morality that insists on the clean proper and pure that refuses to face life directly and honestlyperhaps this very fear of truth is killing the american theater    in the past the standards of achievement and excellence have been set by broadway and because of these rigid rules regulations prejudices and narrowminded concepts the state of the theater today is boring and depressing broadway with its machinelike precision has become the equivalent of a xerox machine it is a place where stage hands and technicians are treated with more deference than actors    would the theater be in this position if it dared to deal with life as painful as it may be as it really exists this would include dealing with all its religious moral political and racial conflicts nowadays black and white writers who are striving to reach broadway audiences must be limited by this factor a writer should not be fenced in he should be able to direct his creative energy toward what he believes to be true he should be free to interpret life fully as he sees it and as all great playwrights before him have dealt with it he should not be forced to speak from two sides of his mouth the money side dont rock the boat please the orchestra and the true side and because of these same dominant values more often than not the negro actor sacrifices his ethnic heritage in order to become more salable ie commercial if he becomes more commercial it therefore follows he becomes more white can he actually merge and identify at the same time    the black actor is the beneficiary of a rich cultural heritage and the day has got to come when he will be allowed to expose this image on every stage in the american theater in order to accomplish this he must constantly think of the race at large and not allow any white person for whatever reason to dictate to him or interpret for him what being negro means because white directors are very guilty of this i have a diary of such incidents and have lost several jobs because of this we are a race of people with a dual cultural heritage in the field of jazz and rhythmandblues our identity is clearly reflected we are american with an african ancestry what an exciting theatrical combination we should not have to choose which one of these combinations we wish to project one enhances the other its like meat and potatoes bread and butter greens and cornbread one makes the other taste better    why should black performers have to conform to values which have so little meaning to them why should they give up something valuable and vital in their own backgrounds in order to fit in ideally all mr kerr and the audience should be concerned with is the talent and craftsmanship of the performer ability is all that should ever be in question was the actor believable if the answer is yes then the audience has understood the meaning of the word universal does it seem reasonable for black actors to give up their individuality the root of their own creative and artistic life in order to blend into or become the same as their fellow white performers if this were to happen the american theater would indeed lose an integral part of real reality contrary to what mr kerr believes the role of the actor seems to me to be that of creation if he can create he can therefore impersonate through the use of dialects costumes makeup and behavior pat terns none of which has to do with skin color let us not confuse impersonation with imitation because that is what in fact is being suggested here in television and movies the black actor has been required to be or has become an exact copy of the white actor in order to obtain jobs let this tragedy not happen in the theater because of the black actors burning desire to become a part of the existing broadway establishment with all its middle class values he has not been able to solicit or maintain a mass black audience he must fight typecasting where qualities and skin coloring take precedence over training ability experience and in some cases even talent he must fight the theory of nonprotest plays life is just a bowl of cherries plays romantic boy meeets girl boy marries girl they live happily ever after plays these situations are not reallife situations to black audiences and as long as we have no audience we will have no power white people support the theater because it is geared toward whites one of our jobs as black actors should then be to remedy this evil we must create an audience we must therefore feed our talent into the black ghettos even while we are still personally pursuing jobs on broadway in order initially to acquire this audience the black writer and actor should become a part of the black community it is impossible to support a blackoriented play without a black audience the producer writer director actor and technician should grow handinhand with this audience one cannot survive without the other when purlie victorious was produced on broadway the actors had to attend banquets dinners churches parties dances and benefits many times directly after their show each night in order to obtain an audience the extra stress and strain should not be placed on any actor black or white the big broadway shows simply use national television to promote ed sullivan tonight show today show merv griffin show etc the few black plays successfully produced either on or offbroadway have been supported under tremendous odds by black people day of absence happy ending raisin in the sun these producers had to fight to keep their shows open and they pridefully point to the fact that black people helped them do this but it seems only logical that if these same plays were produced by the same professional company in a black community they would triple the amount of black theatergoers thereby creating a power base again this has been proven in the music field but musicians have had a longer time to develop their craft and they have not sacrificed or lost their ethnic root in the process look at the apollo lines form around the block to see black entertainers this is something with which the audience can identify as well as enjoy and when a performer warrants international acclaim some clever white producer brings him downtown to philharmonic or carnegie hall it therefore seems at this point our best and most realistic hope is to go back home back to the black community and begin to build a new theater a theater that is not broadwayoriented a theater where you can call the shots as you see them and not be afraid of losing your job a theater where you will be free to experiment and to create a theater where you can relax and be colored colored in speech movement and behavior patterns a theater where you can stop denying and begin identifying then and only then will you be able to create a power base which will allow you to become selfassertive you will then build a following which will enable you to name your price on broadway perhaps this is a form of separation not segregation but as of now i see no other alternative in a short run it will seem to delay the day but in a long run it will most definitely save it save it for the theater and for the generations to come dont worry when you build this theater white people will come in droves by subway foot bus car and even by chauffeurdriven limousine standing first in line to buy tickets theyre smart that way
playwrights in dark glasses
een who was res ir t sponsible for the na ii  k t ona oallery of art  f in washington d c was told by his wife when they were vacationing in cannes to take their eight year old daughter down to the mediterranean to swim so he did the child put one foot in the water and ran to her father saying its cold duveen said sit down stay here ill be back when he returned he was carrying a small pot of boiling water his child watched him pour it into the sea and she stepped in without a murmur i recall another story about august strindberg the great swedish playwright when his grandson climbed into his lap and said spontaneously grandfather can god see in the dark he replied quietly no but your grandfather can the incident of the little girl stepping into the sea and the questions of the little boy are part of the answer to the use and the function of all the arts it is difficult to say what the arts are any of the artsdrama dance poetry architecture painting and sculpture in the words of edna st vincent millay it is like trying to define the colors of sunset to a friend bom blind the artist can help us to survive in a confused neurotic wicked and undefined world by pouring warm water into the cold sea he can look into the dark recesses of our hearts and help us understand what we are and why we are he can also hold up ideals of comic laughter and of human suffering to aid us in better understanding our fellow men he also knows that through the ages nothing has changed only the shadows and the sunshine are in different places there can be a common definition of what art is and especially drama since it embraces all of the arts what do shakespeare langston hughes mies van der rohe chekhov picasso el greco the great cathedral of santa sophia richmond barthe duse miles page billie holiday charlie chaplin michaelangelo sidney poitier martha graham james baldwin and even walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs have in common perhaps robert edmund jones the scenic designer encompassed it when he said you get an idea you set it down and it is there forever this might be one of the keys to unlock the magic and the wonder of artistic creation universality is another although each creation in any of the arts must have a local habitation and a home it must also be universal i remember reading that an actress from abroad came to new york and the first thing she wanted to see was lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun her friend asked her what did you think of it did you understand it the actress replied why of course women everywhere especially mothers strive to fulfill the good life for their children or for their friends  a sense of insecurity is necessary for all artists when they become fat in mind pompous in spirit and repetitive in language and creation they become like gogols dead souls w h auden put it in a succinct way towards the end of his poem the flight into egypt safe in egypt we shall sigh for lost insecuritv only when her terrors come does our flesh feel quite at home richard wright for example wrote in native son black boy and uncle toms children of the terror the hurt the crushed spirits and the laughter through tears of the negros state of being in this country when he became rich and famous he fled to paris and stayed there his life was peaceful unannoyed unmississippi and his writing became that too even so the play native son is now dated because of the blatant propagandists theme and projection inevitability which means that   there can be no other way to do what the artist wants to do is another key the seal of his imaginative characterizations cannot be erased in any way james baldwin in amen corner has created human beings who are truthful because their road to success or ruin cannot be altered in any way they act as they must they speak and feel as they must there is no artificiality that tolling hill of truth gongs throughout this tortured and moving world of the storefront church juxtaposition must always be present in some of the best and feeblest plays of langston hughes he never forgot that laughter sorrow and tragedy go side by side in simply heavenly for example there is simples hilarious speech of what he would do if he were in command of a white regiment of soldiers from the deep south throughout this long speech we laugh with the laughter of understanding afterwards we know that mr hughes has dug the knife deep into the conscience of white america and struck that tolling bell for negroes with dead souls but who survive because they understand the ridiculousness of their position in we hold these truths to be selfevident    that all men are created equal suggestiveness no playwright ever tells all but leaves a great deal to the imagination of the audience so that they as audience can interpret and participate there was a boy in the navy who was darker than eggplant but very handsome whenever he had to go to the town he went through alleys and bypassed crowds because he thought they would laugh at him i slipped a note under his door which said im so black they call me night time when i walk along everyone looks for stars after that he strolled along the wide sidewalks of chicago with a kind of humble and beautiful pride the point is made when clifford odets has one of the women in paradise lost say if i had a child id give it toys of gold to play with these are just some of the few elements that all works of art must have if they are to survive beyond their time    one of the things that is difficult for any minority group and especially its artists to understand is that they are not alone in their suffering that from the sores of job to the weeping mothers whose sons die in vietnam and the terrible torture to the hearts of the people whose children died in the bombed church in birmingham there is a symbolism of the tie between time ago time now and time ahead most of the negro playwrights seem to think that the suffering of negroes is only the suffering of negroes and although in shakespeares words they give this suffering their own local habitation and a home they are hardly giving it a universality that will command artistic distinction and lasting power leroi jones certainly has daring ironic thrust and shocking power however he has none of the qualities listed above in his play the toilet he is saying that the world is a toilet and that the flushing of the urinals and seats is the flushing he is trying to give to a sordid world the total of his works so far except the baptism has the disgusting quality that he means it to have in dutchman he goes far beyond bounds of any artistic law to shock and disgrace an audience into his way of thinking his use of four letter words in these plays seem to be put in to make life as real as he thinks it is playwrights with winning and timeless power have been able to create the same atmosphere that jones wishes to create with their special language that conjures up our imagination because we have not heard these things before in shakespeares hamlet hamlet says of his stepfather    remorseless lecherous treacherous kindless villain o vengeance instead of saying as leroi jones might say my stepfather is full of shit sean ocasey has created characters who have experienced all the tortures of hell and who have never seen the face of god their anger and their anguish holds our attention through the rightness of their language which reflects not only their hearts but their souls mrs boyle after her son has been killed in a local bloody revolution in dublin ireland says to her daughter what was the pain i suffered johnny bringing you into the world to carry you to your cradle to the pains ill suffer carryin you out o the world to bring you to your grave mother o god mother o god have pity on us all blessed virgin where were you when me darlin son was riddled with bullets when me darlin son was riddled with bullets sacred heart o jesus take away our hearts o stone and give us hearts o flesh take away this murderin hate an give us thine own eternal love jean genets the blacks uses music flaring tempers anger poetry and the dance without losing his essential theme black versus white he is daring and provocative he may break wind in our faces but like the greek playwright aristophanes his satire and his apparently amused state of our world shames us while also being a work of art james baldwin wrote a confused and eloquent play in blues for mister charlie it is not a very good one but sometimes goes in the direction of the great greek drama as in that speech of lyle the white murderer who bends over the dead body of richard saying and may every nigger like this nigger end like this nigget face down in the weeds juanita during the trial says with force and greek passion i dont want to be gods mother he can have his icy snowwhite heaven if he is somewhere around this fearful planet if i ever see him i will spit in his face in gods face how dare he presume to judge a living soul a living soul mama is afraid im pregnant mama is afraid of so much im not afraid i hope im pregnant i hope i am one more illegitimate black babythats right you jive mothers and i am going to raise my baby to be a man a man you dig oh let me be pregnant let me be pregnant dont let it all be gone a man juanita a man oh my god there are no more for me did this happen to mama sometime who vanished like smoke and left her to get through this world as best she could is that why she married my father did this happen to mother henry is this how we all get to be mothersso soon of helpless menbecause all the other men perish no no no no what is this world like i will end up taking care of some man some day help me do it with love pete meridian parnell we have been the mothers for them all it must be dreadful to be parnell there is no flesh he can touch all of it is bloody incest everywhere haha youre going crazy juanita oh lord dont let me go mad let me be pregnant let me be pregnant so many of our negro playwrights are so saturated with the idea of negro oppression which of course they should be that they have left out the lasting power the universality of their art they just keep trampin they arent trying to make heaven their home they seem to prefer infernos to the blaze of light that can come in the future many of them have discipline like lofton mitchell and william branch but they hardly have the daring or the flair to infuse high vision with our present angry condition at the end of an opera written for the centennial of howard university the wife of medgar evers sings they think theyve bitten our tongues out cried out our eyes warped out our nerves and left us crippled in this searching sun to rot and wash our dry faces in the dust of their shame they are wrong we will bury you my joe so many thousand strong and from your grave the flowers of freedom will grow with iron strength oh my boy remember they are wrong we will bury you my joe so many thousand strong and from your grave the flowers of freedom will grow with iron strength oh my love remember your father remember us all and tear the teeth that bite you everywhere you roam remember your father went out to meet the foe n almost every country there have been playwrights who have written of and about their times in terms of their ethnic group the best of them have survived and will survive because the conditions about which they write have been set down in terms we may all understand without losing the healing and blessed presence of artistic values the healing and blessed presence of artistic values
the flame that died
the untimely death of otis redding marks a tragic and immeasurable loss to modern blues music otis played a historic role in reviving the feeling of the traditional blues and reinterpreting them for todays generation in a sense his sounds were a vital link between the music of the old traditional black communities of the rural south and the more recent rapidly growing black ghettos of the north and west in order to fully understand the significance of otis contribution to modern music it is necessary to briefly review the status of the blues over the past few decades although the traditional country blues provided the base for rhythm and blues jazz rock and roll and other dominant music forms today during the fifties and sixties they had begun to lose their influence except for the persistent popularity of only the most widely known blues singers each as b b king and muddy waters the popularity of traditional blues music as a whole was losing ground especially in the northern urban areas as more and more black people migrated from the rural south to the big cities further north they became more urbanized more americanized this influenced their music in that they became more concerned with refining the beat of their songs pronouncing the words of songs correctly and omitting the groans shouts and slurring of words of the blues the decline in the popularity of the blues became so great that several older blues artists such as memphis slim and sonny boy williamson left this country to live or work in europe they maintained that the people here no longer appreciate the blues the problem however was not simply a loss in appreciation for the blues it was also the fact that the older blues artists represented an older generation and their music was not completely in tune to changing times and conditions what was needed was a young blues singer who could adapt the soul of the traditional blues to the feelings and experiences of the younger generation the man whose historical destiny was to fulfill this need was none other than otis reddingalso known as the big o and the mad man from macon otis first hit recording these arms of mine was deep in the tradition of the country blues in fact when it first came out many people thought it was performed by one of the older less recognized blues singers of the south by a singer about  or  years of age but at that time otis was only  years old and had just begun to develop as an artist the genius of otis redding was evident from his first recording but perhaps one of the best examples of his genius and versatility is contained in his second album the great otis redding sings soul ballads in otis first album there still are traces of his early influence little richard but by his second album otis is completely himself in the second album otis not only did soulful blues sides which he had helped to compose such as chained and bound come to me and mr pitiful he also did some ballads which had been made popular by other artists for your precious love its too late and a woman a lover and a friend otis did not imitate these ballads in the fashion of the artists who made them but reworked them giving them a fresh blues orientation and often surpassing the efforts of the previous artists the essential differences was the unique blues voice of otis together with his instinctive ability to sing directly from the heart otis natural voice enabled him to do what most other singers could not do he could use slurring words grunts groans and shouts to produce the sweetest of music also he was especially creative in making music out of special sounds unique to his manner of improvisation those distinctive otis sounds such as nanananana ou we ni and fafafafafa but otis did not rely upon his voice alone he was a perfectionist in blending the unique quality of his voice with the singing quality of the horns and the rhumba blues beat of the rhythm section his songs in person and recordings are distinguished by the fact that the instrumental background never clutters or works against his voice the two consistently come off really smooth the sound of the big o  reached its peak in the years   his own songsive been loving you too long respect fafafafafa good to methose he reworked such as satisfaction and try a little tendernessand those he did with carla thomastramp and knock on woodwere just a few of those which gained him international fame there is no question that otis deserved the title king of soul for he was the primary force behind the worldwide recognition and popularity of soul music today and his artistry is one of the best examples of the soul sound as his music indicates otis was an integral part of the profoundly spiritual culture of the black south it was the black communities of the deep south which produced and nurtured him and it was to these communities that he continually returned as the primary source of inspiration for his music and lifes work w e b du bois description of the spiritual qualities of black culture in his book gift o f black folk is also an apt description of the music of otis redding for after all the two are really the same as du bois said of black culture it is hard to define or characterize it a certain joyousness a sensuous tropical love of life  a slow and dreamful conception of the universe an intense sensitiveness to spiritual valuesall these things and others like to them tell of the impact of africa on europe in america otis appreciation of these deep spiritual values of his roots provided the power behind his artistry and personality fully aware that the blues emanated from the people he was truly a poet of the people who sung for the masses and not just for the socalled cultured and sophisticated sets it is now well known how the titles and themes of his songs always reflected the elemental emotions and aspirations of the massessecurity respect just one more day good to me moreover otis always sought to keep the form of his songs at a level where they would remain meaningful to the people in an interview in soul magazine he stated basically i like any music that remains simple and i feel this is the formula that makes soul music successful when any music form becomes cluttered andor complicated you lose the average listeners ear there is nothing more beautiful than a simple blues tune there is beauty in simplicity whether you are talking about architecture art or music in effect otis whole life reflects his genius for recognizing beauty in simplicity he developed the natural gifts inherent in the crude and obscure elements of his lowly country background to become an artist of the highest caliber and of international repute as was brought out in the testimonials given at his funeral otis was a natural prince who sat with those of the highest status in world society but he never lost the common touch and never forgot his family friends and people wilford coates a member of otis personal staff said of the building that housed the offices of otis redding enterprises this building used to be a chicken produce house they cleaned the chickens in the basement and sold them upstairs youd never know it now everything otis touched turned beautiful coming up in a time when the black man is on the rise and coming into his own otis further recog nized that his creativity need not be limited to singing alone he also established successful firms for publishing music and managing young singers and he had developed into an accomplished recording producer outside the field of music he had an honest interest in helping black youth according to his lawyer he had given many scholarships to black students about which the public knew nothing he did these things purely out of his dedication to youth without seeking publicity or reward one of the special projects he was working on at the time of his death was the construction of a summer camp for underprivileged youth from the urban slums and ghettos otis death was so untimely and unexpected that it is nearly impossible to adjust to it at the time of his death he had just recuperated from a minor throat ailment and was beginning to build upon his newly recognized position as the king of soul music he understood the times he lived in and was doing the things he wanted to do for life no one expected his reign to be so brief the only way in which i can reconcile the shock and untimeliness of his death is to repeat a quote that was used to explain the early death of malcolm_x the candle light that burns the brightest dies out the quickest no light in modern music especially the blues burned brighter than that of otis redding we are blessed to have had him around as long as we did
for langston hughes and stella holt
in  at one of those perennial writers g conferences the brilliant arna bontemps told the story of old sis goose she was swimming on a lake and a sheriff appeared and ordered her off the lake the sheriff was a fox and old sis goose snapped that she had a right to swim on the lake the sheriff arrested her and when they got to the jailhouse old sis goose looked up and saw the jailkeeper was a fox too when her case got to trial old sis goose looked around and saw that the prosecuting attorney was a fox her own lawyer was a fox and the court clerk was a fox the judge himself was a fox and when the jury appeared every member of it was a fox sis goose shook her head and said i aint got long to stay here i borrowed mr bontemps yarn on february   it was on the occasion that marked the refurbished greenwich mews theater being dedicated to the memory of langston hughes and stella holt that date also would have been the sixtyseventh birthday of the great langston hughes it was an altogether fitting gesture on the part of the village presbyterian church and brotherhood synogogue sponsors of the greenwich mews theater which is housed in the basement of the building at  west th street in new york city this theater under stella holts leadership had introduced several black playwrights to the downtown area and it has consistently produced the plays of the late mr hughes ttiere was considerable discussion after mr hughes death about a drive being led by stella holt to  name the theater the langston hughes theater when stella followed langston to the grave there was talk too of naming the institution the langston hughesstella holt theater then there was a hue and a cry from righteous souls that the langston hughes theater should be housed in harlem no one bothered to note that negroes belong in greenwich village as much as they do in harlem no one bothered to remember that in  when new york city was a dutch outpost known as new amsterdam  african slaves were imported tfiey were housed on the fringe of what is now the bowery these  africans built a wagon road to the upper part of the settlementto a place the dutch called haarlem then spelled with two as eighteen years later with the support of the rankandfile white colonists the africans petitioned the dutch for freedom received it and settled in a swampland which they built into a prosperous community that community is today known as greenwich village indeed the first negro theater known to this country existed in greenwich village this was the african grove theater housed at bleecker and grove streets this group performed shakespearean plays in the year  the group was spearheaded by james hewlett and it had a great influence on actor ira aldridge the destruction of the african grove by white hoodlums had a marked influence upon mr aldridges career he realized  then that america offered little hope to black actors and he sailed for europe where he was acclaimed by royalty it was indeed senseless to suggest that the langston hughes theater should not be housed in greenwich village at any rate the church and the synagogue leaders settled the entire matter when they decided to keep the name greenwich mews and dedicate the theater to mr hughes and miss holt the hit show running there at the time consists of two oneacters by the african playwright wole soyinka directed by cynthia belgrave and produced in association with miss belgraves husband kenneth farris that offering was suspended for the evening and those who appeared at the dedication stepped first into the theater lobby where a handsome plaque was placed on the lobby wall here too stood a picture of mr hughes and miss holt the curtain was down in the refurbished theater  and there was a heavy silence about the place a silence of respect admiration and love the audience then went upstairs to the church this church since  has been unique in religious terms for that year dr jesse w stitt the presbyterian minister and rabbi irving block joined forces and organized what is now known as the village presbyterian church and the brotherhood synagogue dr stitt spoke of stella holts efforts in the nineteenfifties to persuade him to permit the founding of the greenwich mews theater rabbi block also spoke others on the program were actress miriam colon raoul abdul who had worked closely with mr hughes and maxwell t cohen who had been a lawyer for both mr hughes and miss holt for the second half of the program there was a performance of jericho jimcrow featuring gilbert price joseph attles hilda harris dorothy drake rosalie king barney hodges and the hugh porter gospel singers the story about old sis goose was told because i felt both langston hughes and stella holt knew the meaning of that story i think that is why they were honored in that theater they both loved so much and i think that is why too both of them made worthy contributions to our culture    the easiest thing in the world to do and the quickest way to success is to cut down a man of color the examples are numerous that filthy war in asia where men of color are being killed needlessly that filthy nation known as the republic of south africa which is supported by the american empire and that filthy situation in rhodesia    the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color immediately comes to mind such names as denmark vesey paul robeson patrice lumumba malcolm_x ben bella nkrumah muhammad ali richard wright and langston hughes and stella holt the custom is with us today  and anyone who doesnt believe me should work for one day in the city of new york department of social services or in the antipoverty program in fact cutting down a black man has become so fashionable that black people are getting in on the act look at what james baldwin did to richard wright with his alas poor richard look at what saunders redding did to julian mayfield and countless other black writers look at the daily insults that add to the weight of a writers years when people consistently ask why dont you write this kind of stuff or that kind of stuff why arent you rich with all the stuff you put out would you write this for me on speculation would you give me a free autographed copy of your book the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color langston hughes and stella holt never played that game they were beautiful people and they paid dearly for their beauty i first met langston hughes when i was a boy in harlem clubleaders andrew burris glenn carrington and zell ingram introduced me to his work which i loved later actordirectorproducer dick campbell invited me to ioin his rose mcclendon playersa group he had built in memory of that great black actress i joined mr campbells group and worked in his shows and he introduced me to people i had read about for years one night i went with him and his late wife muriel rahn to see a play by langston hughes called dont you want to be free it was presented at  west th street in almost the same spot that now houses the offices of state senator basil paterson and the new york courier the leading role was played by robert earl jones and later by albert grant the work itself was the forerunner of mr hughes jericho jimcrow that night i first met langston hughes he shook my hand and he stood there that eternal cigarette dangling from his lips and i stood there openmouthed and overwhelmed i did not see him again for many years college naval service and endless travel kept us apart in the early s actors maxwell glanville and julian mayfield produced ossie davis first play alice in wonder ruby dee starred in the play and i was its associate producer when we presented it at the elks community theater i met mr hughes again we went into a scene he insisted upon paying his way into the theater and i insisted that he not pay it was our honor to have him there he told me ive got to help the group in some way and he placed a bill on the table and entered the theater later we met at various gatherings and talked about writing he was particularly fond of my two sons tommy and melvin and he used to send them his books when they were published our paths crossed again in   the greenwich mews theater had optioned his play simply heavenly but for some reason the work couldnt be done in that theater i believe some influential people in top positions objected to the fact that much of the play was set in a bar there is always some reason for not doing a play by a black playwright he doesnt have enough teeth or he didnt have the work properly typed or the season isnt right or some such nonsense the same kind of excuses are given for not having a black quarterback playing professional football allamerican sandy stephens couldnt really throw or he liked to run too much with the ball or hank washington needs seasoning and theyll probably find out that the great jimmy raye is too short too tall or too something or other anyway simply heavenly could not be done at the mews while plans were being made to present it in another theater i completed the play that came to be known as a land beyond the river fellow playwright david timmons invited me to his house to read the script mr timmons had no heat in his house and i told him that while i am a northern boy who loves cold weather i do not like it indoors mr timmons then suggested that i meet him at the home of stella holt i did just that and i read my play in the presence of frances drucker stella holt and david timmons stella promptly grabbed the script and said she was going to produce it at the mews andif the mews directors didnt like it she was going to produce the play on her own and she went into motion and when stella holt went into motion she went into motion in fact david timmons and i once labelled stella and fran the special delivery girls well stella delivered a land beyond the river and michael howard who had been scheduled to direct simply heavenly found himself directing my play and dont you know langston hughes was ecstatic because my play was being done he was a big big man he had been out there alone for many many years he never wanted to be the only black writer he created an atmosphere a climate among black writersa brotherhood if an assignment came up hed look into it and pass it on to one of us and we do this today many a time william branch or alice childress or john killens have done much like langston and passed on writing assignments to me often at critical times in the early s i was having a very difficult time langston suggested that i do special research for a book he wanted to write about gypsies he got quite an advance and we signed contracts we kept meeting and talking about writing the book but we never got to do it he called me before he went to california to make a speech and said that when he got back we would definitely get around to writing the book i never saw him again when he returned from california he was stricken and he died a special memorial service was held in the harlem area for langston hughes i telephoned his agent to notify him he said i guess youre going to have to write that gypsy book alone i said that i would he then told me i should be able to get another advance for the publisher had deducted my advance from one of langstons other books when my wife marjorie came home i told her about it and tears came to both our eyes marjorie said he never told you he never told me he was a big big man with a big big heart he was a black man and they cut him to pieces they hacked him he wrote better than hollywood and broadway combined not to mention television but they didnt call on him to write those million dollar lechnicolored movies and make in his words moneys mammy langston once said that gershwin wrote porgy and bess from a downtown penthouse looking at harlem while the duke was riding the a train    no they gave him fame but little fortune they didnt want him to earn a decent living and i know why the last thing the american empire wants is cultural equality it does not want to know the truth of the black experience and so its foundations will give lots of money to groups but those groups are not doing the plays of william branch alice childress ossie davis louis peterson theodore ward leroi jones clifford masonall recognized authors the easiest thing in the world to doand the quickest way to successis to cut down a man of color and so they cut down langston hughes they allowed him to live long enough to have his intelligence insulted when they offered hallelujah baby instead of goodmorning daddy a hurry sundown instead of a hurried sunrise tired blood when we need youngblood they give us a guess whos coming to dinner when we know who has been starving us for years they will give us anything but justice i first met stella holt in the s when she served as business manager for the greenwich mews theater she impressed me immediately not only for her theatrical vision but also because of her love for humanity she became my beloved friend and after the produc tion of a land beyond the river i made a point of visiting her every time i had completed a new work i always read it to her and to frances drucker and both were always effervescent she and fran came out on a cold rainy day in may  to see a special performance of my tell pharaoh and stella immediately went to work trying to have it presented throughout the new york city public school system it was when i visited her to read my new musical ballad of a blackbird that she mentioned that langston called her nightly his calls meant a great deal to her i refused to call stella after langston died i just didnt have the nerve to call her yet i knew i had to call i kept postponing it then finally i clenched my teeth and called she was very ill and the grief in her voice ripped at my ears and jarred me she said she simply couldnt believe that langston had really died no she said he is not dead she went on to say that   she and fran were going to the country but she wanted marjorie and me to visit them i promised that we would after all i had to give her a copy of my book black drama to which she and langston contributed so very much i never gave her the book for i never saw her again i was sitting at my typewriter one day when the telephone rang it was stellas brotherinlaw and when he identified himself i cried out oh no there it was my other beautiful friend who had produced  plays who had journeyed to harlem one time and arranged a special showing of my play the cellarmy friend who had taken on a land beyond the river before i could get it out of my typewriterhad joined my other beautiful friend and hers this stella holt who like dick campbell produced more works by black playwrights than anyone else i know of in new york city had departed this life stella and langston langston and stella what can i write of them in this society of the foxes this society which is built on cutting down men of color i can only say that i challenge this system to the teeth and i am someday going just like those friends of mine fighting all the way i can go bravely too because the divine creator blessed me by allowing me to walk beside two beautiful people
todays black actors are portraying roles beyond their reach  years ago and proving that a mans race is no measure of theatrical talent a little black boy born in lower manhattan  years before the american civil war became a fleshandblood monument to the same cause under even more trying circumstances in august memorial societies and theaters in the united states and other parts of the world commemorated the onehundredth anniversary of the death of ira frederick aldridge pioneer who won admiration in almost every european country in the middle of the nineteenth century for his shakespearean performances aldridge acclaimed as a genius and one of the most precise interpreters of shakespeare of all time was the first black man to play leading white characters including lear shylock and macbeth for his stage triumphs he received many honorsamong them the medal for art and science from frederick iv of prussia the cross of leopold from the emperor of russia and the maltese cross in switzerland in  the republic of haiti awarded him a commission in the army of haiti in the seventeenth regiment of the grenadier guards of the president of the republic franz joseph emperor of austria presented him with the medal of ferdinand he was made a brother mason of the grand lodge of ireland in  at that time the prussian gold medal had been awarded only to german naturalist baron von humbolt italian composer gasparo spontini and franz liszt but this was not aldridges most important official recognition in  the royal family of england made him a member of the royal saxon house order aldridge capping all earlier successes had become the first member of his race to be knighted throughout his life he often referred to himself as chevalier ira aldridge knight of saxony as is often the case time and scant information have caused a great deal of legend and fantasy to become interwoven with the facts of aldridges life ira aldridge was born in new york on july   although he is claimed by senegal west africa and bel air in harford county maryland this date is supported by several official documents including his death certificate it has been theorized that iras father daniel aldridge who died september   in new york was brought to america as a slave but it is more likely that daniels father came to this country in bondage and dubbed aldridge after his master iras mother lurona died while he was still a child daniel aldridge intended his son for a career in the ministry but the youth had already made up his mind about his lifes workhe wanted to be an actor as a student at the african free school in new york ira won prizes in speaking this sign that he had talent to be developed turned the boys love for the theater into a passion dramatic performances available to a black performer in the early s were very limited ira must have saved his pennies to see the shows the way modem youngsters use their allowances to see motion pictures on saturdays mystery swirls around the details but the aspiring actor probably made his first stage appearance at browns theater in new york which opened in  at a time when james hewlett was the star attraction later he attempted the role of romeo after a taste of success the young black actor must have realized that the united states offered him little chance to advance in his craft and he decided to emigrate to europe james and henry wallack actors of that period befriended aldridge and when james boarded a ship for liverpool ira shipped as a steward on the same vessel the rumor persisted throughout aldridges career that he had been wallacks personal attendant aldridge arrived in england in  and he may have studied for a time at glasgow university britain was in the process of abolishing slavery in its colonies and sympathy for blacks was strong feelings ran high and aldridge used this to his advantage with wallacks backing and a favorable social situation he made his first appearances at either the royalty or coburg theaters in london in october  he began his first engagement with top billing at the coburg after playing to packed houses his performances were extended for four weeks aldridge used the title mr keene tragedian of colour early in his career an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame of edmund kean a wellknown contemporary actor later he became known as  the african roscius after the roman actor quintus roscius gallus who lived before the birth of christ aldridge always demonstrated a flair for publicity and it is possible he gave himself this name the african roscius claimed his ancestors were african princes but this too may have been a romantic story he devised after his successful london engagement aldridge toured the provinces for several years treating the time as an apprenticeship he studied hard and refined his techniques later he traveled deep into russia bringing the works of shakespeare for the first time to remote towns and villages during these performances he often spoke his lines in english while the rest of the cast used their native tongues aldridge adopted england as his homeland and was granted british citizenship in november  he married twice and had two sons and two daughters after touring russia and the continent for the last few years of his life aldridge died august   in lodz poland apparently of a lung ailment that had plagued him for some time two days later he was buried in the evangelical cemetery there his tombstone a large cross was erected in  there are  memorial chairs in the shakespeare memorial theater at stratforduponavon in the fourth row of stalls is one with a bronze plate that tells it is dedicated to ira aldridge the african roscius is at last among his peers
the brothers and sisters had been swaying to night train and grinding to harlem nocturne which sets the time as the early s in a black night spot in newark the band leader lynn was blowing hard the congregation screamed urged him on he started marching across the stage the sidemen joined and then off the stage and into the crowd that filled the graham their heads bad they moved near the back of the hall chanting and swaying and passed right in front of me writes leroi jones who    fell in line behind the last wild horn man strutting like the rest of them everyone joined in the march around the hall but their energy would not be contained five or six hundred hoppedup woogies tumbled out into belmont avenue defying sunday night traffic narrator jones reflects we screamed and screamed at the clear image of ourselves as we should always be ecstatic completed involved in a secret communal expression it would be the form of the sweetest revolution to hucklebuck into the fallen capital and let the oppressors lindy hop out we marched all the way to spruce weaving among the stalled cars laughing at the dazed white men who sat behind the wheels the book is tales grove press  and includes  of them the best of whichas in the screamers abovecelebrates the truly black experience perhaps better than has yet been accomplished in the world of letters leroi jones in these mostly autobiographical works depicts black life as he saw it indeed lived it never sacrificing authenticity in favor of white readers understanding the clear image of ourselves as we should always be is a recurring and never dully stated theme of jones last few years labor with much poignancy he gives evidence of a mature understanding of the black lifestyle and in these tales as in his essaysthere is an omnipresent insistence that the power of black people is found in their lifestyle jones commands to be heard we are the zigzags of our own design is it secret are they walking the streets each night with hands in their pockets to see god the question burns and one knows immediately that the answer is not found in the very white sociology of the harvard irishman it was jones yearning as he puts it for any further separation from where my good grades were sure to lead that led him to the graham that same yearning led him also to the point where he couldnt walk stupid or unfeeling or in hip germany forever it was my own life i looked at it watched it in other peoples eyes it was nothing to me but real an extraordinary craftsman probably more genius than we dare admit jones has emerged not as americas leading negro writer but rather as her most formidable black artist because he has not turned his back on that energy which is black and which in this land makes black and white diverse and diametrically opposed he recognized that energy and rooted his work in it and only the wild and very poor thrived in grahams or could be roused by lynns histories and rhythms he writes but others have not merely failed to recognize that energyits powerbut would disclaim it america had choked the rest who could sit still for hours under popular songs or be readied for citizenship by slightly bohemian social workers writing about his childhood the short skinny boy with the bubble eyes his military days hitched like a common fool to the air force of the united states or a fantasy about the day after the crackers were defeated this ol cat me an pinball recognized still had a fag thing going for him in a fur coat he was some kind of magistrate bobby and moosie were questioning him about some silver he was supposed to have stashed he was a silver freak the dude was actually weeping crying big sobs the women crowded away from him i guess they really couldnt feel sorry for him because he was  crying about money jones always excites one with his ability to communicate motion and his wit compliments his anger which brings to mind something he said before a chicago audience a little over a year ago after  years yall still checking the cracker out or at fisk university six months later vietnam is simply whiteys greatest work of art jones laughs at a stupid world and he could have chosen to take some of its more valued prizes a tale called new spirit reveals a humility as rare as his arrogance it is a painfully personal undertaking about a young girl who died who was his lover filled with haunting honestyall the more haunting if you dug the young girls speed and jive one morning in newark for just a few minutes and thought her unusually kind and remember that you were a mite confused by the presence of the young girl and the other woman who were like sisters and who spoke lovingly of roi leroi jones doubtless is a man obsessed with a need to share all that is his life in these tales he does exactly that with a perfect dignity meanwhile he is placed on trial in the wilderness of new jersey for something or other while in the country of his birth the president lacks even imperfect dignity while calling for a national day of prayer who is the enemy but jones can write the shapes in the darkness had histories falling out of windows failing to become mayor of their mothers universes we must work together put on the right brightness    stop killing each other wheel to face the actual killers i wanted to do this and wheel and wheel

begin with there v  i £ is reason to hope  i £ that the long famine of kztdesa significant theater in the black communities of america is nearing an end the hope lies in the resurgence of cultural excitement and creativity among the young if for no other reason than through cultural fallout there is cause to be optimistic about the theatrical arts but there also appears to be more concrete cause all over the country young black minds which have been inspired and liberated by the black revolution are seeking out fresh and native modes of expression they are finding the courageand increasingly the supportto turn their backs on the grand gurus of the arts in america who would define for them the nature and needs and limits of their artistic expression with that said it also must be admitted that there is little theatrical activity around at the moment to make the hope for the future seem much more than that there is a great deal of theatrical activity yes but much of it is of the conventional variety primarily conventional in both conception and goal there are however certain outstanding exceptions most of them centered in the area of manhattan in a way the most important theatrical enterprise in new york is the new lafayette theater which under the direction of robert macbeth got off to a bright start last october mr macbeth and his small company took over the rehearsal hall of the old lafayette theater in harlem and aided by grants from the ford foundation the new york state arts council and the rockefeller foundation launched a season with playwright ronald milners whos got his own which a season earlier had been produced downtown at the american place theater they also did athol fugards the blood knot mr macbeth brought in playwright ed bullins from san francisco as playwrightinresidence and scheduled mr bullins threeact play in the wine time for spring production things did not go entirely well however and the first of the year found mr macbeth and company on the premises of the american place theater where mr bullins three oneactersa son come home which is published on page and the being the  claras old man electronic niggerwere prepared for performance problem uptown was primarily one of funds an old sad familiar story the beautifulif impractical innovation of the new lafayette theater was the free entrance policy for the people of harlem the people came to the seat theater that reported percent and mr macbeth the theater was  filled on week days and completely filled on weekends then in february the new lariously ing comvard ver phil cohran  copyrighted material the mr  fayette theater myste burned leaving the fledgli pany with no base tov end of the month howe  macbeth announced that he had received another  grant from the new york foundation contingent upon his raising matching funds and that a campaign was underway to secure  for the theater meanwhile he was searching for a theater of some  seats in the harlem community and he seemed hopeful mr macbeth was quoted in the new york times as saying that the new theater when it is located will do adaptations or revisions of the works of bertold brecht and albert camus as well as the works of black playwrights one hopes that he will reconsider this there are hundreds of theater groups on and off broadway performing the works of white playwrights black playwrights desperately need the exposure black theater groups can give them the theater which had raised the highest hopes and which caused the most excitement over the past few months is the negro ensemble company the brainchild of douglas turner ward and robert hooks the nec as it is popularly termed is considered elsewhere on these pages in articles by peter bailey and dick campbell but it is fair to note that the unfurled program of the theater met with considerable disappointment in the black community the nec received an unprecedented  from the ford foundation ostensibly for the promotion and cultivation of the theater arts among black people and it was generally accepted that the nec went out of its way in failing to fulfill a part of its purpose the criticism centered around the necs failure to seek out and produce the works of black american playwrights of the four plays announced for necs first season three are the works of white playwrights although one play was adapted from the french by the late richard wright the fourth play kongis harvest by the nigerian wole soyinka had its premiere performance during the first world festival of negro arts at dakar senegal in april  confronted with this criticism mr ward responded by indicating that acceptable plays by black playwrights were not available such playwrights as loften mitchell alice childress ted ward and ronald milner replied that they had not been approached by mr ward or anyone else from nec that criticism aside the nec evidently is living up to its expectations in other areas in the companys first production peter weiss song of the lusitanian bogey the acting was all firstrate the staging provocative the direction keen and powerful and this was the work of black actors directors and technicians mr ward has indicated that in succeeding seasonsthe nec will produce the works of black playwrights it is to be hoped that this will be so nevertheless one is left with nagging questions about the real intentions of the nec directors relative to the black community mr ward sought to justify the location of his theater in greenwich village on the grounds that it was between harlem and bedfordstuyvesant the two major centers of black population in the new york area thereby facilitating travel to second avenue and eighth street by people from both communities it is a flimsy rationalization the nec appeal is directly to sophisticated white audiences on a typical weekend night there were five black people in the capacity audienceand at least two of those gained admission with press tickets a short distance from the negro ensemble company headquarters in the st marks theater the greenwich mews theater provided a showcase for two plays by wole soyinka the highly regarded nige rian playwright the plays the strong breed and the trials of brother jero were produced under the aegis of farrisbelgrave productions in association with diana sands and afolabi ajayi cynthia belgraves the actress also served as director of the plays the production received almost unanimous raves from the critics and the performances were unquestionably excellent although this writer had seen a superior production of the trials of brother jero several years earlier at karamu house in cleveland ohio as an example of the vitality and enterprise present among black theater people the farrisbelgrave production was singular also it was high time that new yorkers were exposed to the work of black africas most respected playwright again however it is a pity that the people of harlem and bedford stuyvesant will not have easy access to the presentation of talented black theater people in this writers opinion the theater group in the general new york area with most immediate promise for reaching the black communities is playwright leroi jones group over in newark the spirit house movers and players is a repertory company which already has traveled as far afield as massachusetts washington dc connecticut and pennsylvania and there are plans to troupe out to the midwest in the spring at the present plays in the repertory include  the militant preacher by ben caldwell arm yrself or harm yrself by leroi jones and we own the night by jimmy garrett three additional jones playsa black mass great goodness of life and home on the range plus plays by ed bullins joe white and ben caldwell are in preparation for the company the spirit house movers and players is of course innovative in intent its format is broad enough to embrace for example skits and poetry readings and a youth group called the young black militants all presently  years of age is a popular feature of the theater group among the actors at spirit house are yusef iman barry wynn carl boissiere david mitchell larry miller mubar ic mahud salimah barbara wynn jacqueline bugg sandra lein sylvia jones and herbie stokes robert washington is stage manager and james campbell and leroi jones are directors march was scheduled as the month for the opening of a doublebill by playwright william wellington mackey in new york assisted by actors agent ernestine mcclendon the playwright brought in from chicago the young director who staged a successful production of one of the two plays requiem for brother x at the hull houses south side theater a year ago the companion play family meeting has never been produced previously dick gaffield is the director during the past season there were several plays both on and off broadway which featured black actors in substantial roles diana sands of course portrayed the title role in george bernard shaws st joan a production of the repertory theater of lincoln center miss sands is a fine actress and st joan was well staged and well acted but the whole affair held little attraction for black audiences claudia mcneil appeared in a silly charade called something different and pearl bailey headed still heads a cast of beautiful black people in the colorful fluff hello dollyl josephine premice took the leading role in a new version of truman capotes fanciful house of flowers and cleavon little was the black sex symbol in scuba duba a group of vibrant and attractive young people black and white made of the musical drollery hair an especially delightful and provocative evening all exuberance and irreverence and as relevant as rain and air almost unnoticed black dancers and choreographers have stolen the theater lead from black actors and playwrights never before has afroamerica been represented by so large a contingent of superlative dancers several of whom also are choreographers of the first rank among them carmen de lavallade alvin ailey donald mckayle eleo pomare talley beatty miguel godreau judith jamison james truitt rod a rodgers arthur mitchell    most of these dancers and the works they perform unfortunately are unknown beyond the new york commuting area it is a pity one of the cultural foundations could do a great service by sponsoring say the alvin ailey dancers on a national tour of black communities across the country los angeles seems to have completely overshadowed san francisco in significant theater activity according to our west coast editors the five most active theater groups in the metropolitan los angeles area are mafundi institute douglas house foundation pasla performing arts society of los angeles iccc inner city cultural center and ebony showcase there are of course other groups the institute for black studies for example has a theater wing mafundi which in swahili means artist institute was founded to explore black art and culture it was funded through the brooks foundation actor william marshall is director of the actors workshop and oscar brown jr heads the resident musical group the actors were preparing a black version of oedipus rex at deadline and the musical theater was plan ning a musical under browns direction mafundi institute also is concerned with developing the cinematic arts within the black community the douglass house foundation is perhaps the best known cultural center in the los angeles area because of screenwriter bud schulbergs association with it harry dolan whose screenplay losers weepers was performed on nbctv is director the theater group recently presented an adaptation of herbert a simmons novel corner boy douglass house also sponsors a tv film theater workshop pasla is directly concerned with establishing relevant theater in the black community and the thrust of the organization is nonprofit the theater performed a play for children liar liar during the winter and was preparing several projects at press timein times like these an anthology of folklore among them the iccc is federally funded and is designed to serve the total community with emphasis on those members of minority groups which have not previously had access to training in the theater arts it has received almost  from the us office of education and  from the national foundation on the arts and the humanities the iccc produces such plays as the seagull richard lit and the caucasian chalk garden the classics in other words of the better known theater  groups affecting the black community in los angeles perhaps the ebony showcase is most important the seat theater which is owned by nick stewart was presenting douglas turner wards two plays day of absence and happy ending at press time professional actors as well as novices are involved in the theater and it could develop into the western anchor of a string of independent black theaters across the country in between new york and los angeles the picture of black theater is gloomy in detroit there is the usual number of embryonic groups with talent dispersed and interest uncorralled the most hopeful group now as in the recent past is concept east theater which considers that  was an exciting year like newarks spirit house movers and players the concept east theater has turned to repertory theater the actors traveled outside of the state for performances and it is available for community organizations within the state under a joint arrangement with the michigan state council for the arts david rambeau is director mr rambeau also is editor of a new publication the black arts theater magazine chicago is virtually without a vital theater group althoughhere againthere can be found a number of small striving drama units playwright ted ward founded the south side center of the performing arts and reconditioned the louis theater a former movie house but the theater company has not been able to touch the vast black community for several months mr ward presented his yearold play our lan playing on weekends it is not unfair to say that a more recent play might have brought mr wards valiant efforts more attention another chicago theater reconditioned like mr wards is proving a more attractive center for the black community although the theater is not reserved for drama alone the affroarts theater is the base of operations for phil cohran the composer and his artistic heritage ensemble fridays through sundays the public is invited to be entertained by a package assembled by mr cohran consisting of singers and dancers all accompanied by the artistic heritage ensemble the theater also serves during the day as a center of black studies with classes in arabic and swahili lectures in african history and islam during weekday evenings the theater is available for blackoriented presentations and mr cohran is especially interested in having drama groups make use of the theater facilities local dramatists such as val gray ward and gerald wallace alone and with groups help to keep the spirit of theater alive in the city the best known black theater group in the south remains the free southern theater which operates out of new orleans traveling to nearby rural areas under the direction of tom dent black actors however do find employment in white theaters in minneapolis michigan and washington dc it was in washington incidentally that one of the best plays of the season was produced how ard sacklers abrasive the great white hope the play is based on the life and career of former heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson and it is a lulu both episodic and long over  hours the play nevertheless demands the attention and it is never boring much of the credit for that of course must go to james earl jones who portrayed jack jefferson johnson he was superb and he was supported by a fine sensitive performance from jane alexander it has been announced that the great white hope will be produced on broadway next season over in rochester mich a suburb of detroit the john fernald company of the meadow brook theater presented and people all around a play based on the murders of three civil_rights workers in mississippi four years ago the play is by george sklar and it was produced a year ago in england at the bristol old vic the play was not warmly received here whether because it is not a good play we cannot report not having seen it but the music and lyrics by booker t bradshaw jr were wildly praised mr fernald it should be noted is not an american but an englishman a former director of the royal academy of dramatic art in london the university of california extension at santa barbara in cooperation with the department of dramatic art conducted under a grant from the us office of education will hold a summer institute repertory theater featuring plays by four black playwrights between june  and august  the plays will be performed by a repertory company of teachers and trainers in theatrical programs in junior and senior high schools throughout the nation the institute staff includes owen dodson and william brown both familiar to drama students at howard university fellows at the institute will receive  weekly with an additional  per week for each dependent hoyt w fuller 
ear don when you told me that you were writing a review attacking robert haydens book kaleidoscope i told you that if i did not agree with you i would write an answer i have read your review and i am writing an answer this is not easy as i know and respect both you and hayden however i shall try to keep my eyes on the object which is the book and to avoid irrelevant issues first i must say that it is not so harsh a review as i expected you tacitly admit the importance of the book by writing a sixpage review of it if it were a negligible book it would be dismissed in one or two paragraphs or not reviewed at all you say that for most readers a sad disappointment is in store then you contradict yourself by praising most of the poems one does not expect every reader to like all the poems in an anthology but when you treat the poets one by one you express liking for the poems of all but two or three you find fault with haydens choices of hughes and jones poems but thats a matter of personal taste the remark you attribute to leroi jones that all it takes to compile an anthology is scissors and a little imagination may be taken out of context as it stands it is so obvious as to be silly an anthology is a collection where else can an editor gather a collection than from previous publications sometimes an edi tor solicits unpublished poems but such collections are not always successful as some poets submit old poems which have been rejected or new poems not quite worked out which later they regret having published prematurely perhaps jones remark would make better sense if it were amplified to say that editors should not confine themselves to other anthologies but should do research in periodicals and the books of individual poets that is what hayden did you say hayden used his imagination in writing some of the biographical sketches but you dont document your charge its true that some of the poems have been anthologized before but you should note which poems and how often some poets like hughes have a large body of work and an editor has a wide choice which hayden took advantage of including several littleknown hughes poems others like toomer whom you praise have published only a few poems and an editors choice is limited in an anthology readers expect to find some familiar poems along with unfamiliar ones a reader reaches for his anthology not the individual poets book which most likely he doesnt own to find classics like if we must die and from the dark tower an editor includes classics like these along with unfamiliar or new poems which will be come classics in their turn what is bad is to constantly reprint a poets secondbest work like tolsons dark symphony preventing exposure of his better work hayden avoids this trap with tolson you call countee cullen emasculated true he wrote in the traditional forms and was influenced by john keats that does not emasculate anyone i dont remember just what i said to you about poems being reprinted in anthologies as i have said various things one remark mav have been that poems become wellknown by being reprinted in anthogies as collections sell more widely than single works another remark may have deplored the reprinting of one poem to the neglect of other work you say that was the second appearance of booker t and w e b in an anthology actually it was the third as it also appeared in rosey pools ik ben die nieuwe neper i dont think three appearances is overexposure in addition hayden selected two poems of mine which had never been anthologized george and souvenirs a percentage of two thirds new poems is a good ratio i believe as i said before i dont find too much to object to in your review your biggest criticism seems to be not with the poems but with haydens introduction i cant follow the beginning of your review very well as its incoherent and confused as one example you say those very words poems by american negro poets and not the books title will sell this anthology those words poems by american negro poets are part of the books title they are what is known as the subtitle often but not always an author chooses a striking original word or phrase for the first part of the title and explains it by a second phrase i think kaleidoscope is an excellent choice a brilliant poetic word suggesting the color and the variety of the poetry in the book the hackneyed second part of the title is a prosaic explanation of the poetic first part this word was chosen by a poet not by a salesman nevertheless i think it will attract many buyers who will feel that the sensitivity which could make such an apt choice would also select good poems as a second example of confusion you ask why we need negro sic anthologies hayden answered that question on page xxiv of his introduction ideological weapons are needed hayden does not antagonize black poets by calling them negro poets he calls them negro poets we do not need ghettos etc television and the other mass media are indeed white ideological weapons all the more reason for us to have some hayden paid his dues by writing distinguished black poetry before you were born his gabriel hanged for leading a slave revolt frederick douglass runagate and middle passage will be alive when you and i are dead and what a gifted poet has to say about poetry is always worthy of consideration have you forgotten voltaires i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it as i interpret haydens remarks they boil down to the conviction that a poet can write about anything without restrictions and that his work should be measured by rigorous standards without inferior work being puffed up just because its black either by white condescension or black chauvinism i agree with your approval of the format and arrangement one excellent feature is the short critical remarks about each poet although perhaps few of the poets will like them as hayden impartially touches not only their strengths but also their weaknesses the book was not intended to be a comprehensive survey and enough poets are left out to make a creditable anthology among them don l lee etheridge knight sonia sanchez carmin auld goulbourne le graham sarah webster fabio welton smith edward spriggs bobb hamilton rolland stallings lawrence p neal theodore horne raymond patterson jay wright and others this is not to criticize as the book accomplishes its purpose of giving an introduction to negro poetry but to observe that other editors can say here is gods plenty and can roll up their sleeves and follow your prescription or proscription of taking their scissors and pasting up another anthology yours dudley randall
dear editor sir mr randalls objectivity is somewhat ambiguous or is it just a device he uses to make his remarks sound more convincing at times faulkner in reference to negroes thought he was objective too mr randall is about as objective as an anteater looking for food his friendship with mr hayden is widely known and he should not hide behind a meaningless euphemism mr randall indicated to me before my review was printed that if he disagreed with me he would write a rebuttal which is fine but lets not hide behind an innocent term friendship is preciousa friend is a rare book of which but one copy is madeand a friend or his work should be defended if one deems it necessary first i did not start out or intend in anyway to write a harsh review of mr haydens book i tried to constructively criticize kaleidoscope as truthfully and as honestly as possible in accordance with my beliefs and ideals naturally my personal feelings as to what art is and the function of said art would be expressed in very certain terms i am not so objective as mr randall i agree with mr randall mr haydens book is important the question is in what way  does the importance of kaleidoscope live within the context of being a meaningful and eloquent addition to black literature i doubt it is it that kaleidoscope exposed us to young new inventive writers no or even old new inventive writers is it that mr haydens book published heretofore unpublished and hard to find poetryif you consider miss phillis wheatley hard to find yes what is the significance of kaleidoscope there is none except that it is a poor extension of western white literature the bookif not for this brief exchange of wordswould have traveled from editor to publisher to printer back to publisher to book stores unnoticed few if any advanced reviews were written the publishers promotional efforts were minute and the majority of black stores as well as white ones did not stock the book mr randall misread me for i didnt say that for most readers a sad disappointment is in store i qualified my statement with for those of us who buy and read anthologies a sad    and also added that blacks who carefully read negro anthologies will be aware of the fact that of the  poems in  kaleidoscope almost half have been anthologized elsewhere  by my count as i see it there is no contradiction but a case of poor reading on mr randalls part as to where the reprinted  appeared and to their frequency i would need another six pages yes i feel that mr haydens book is important i reviewed it yet those people who he is obviously trying to appeal to have virtually overlooked kaleidoscope why has not kaleidescope been reviewed by white critics why has the budd schulberg watts anthology received reviews while mr haydens bookboth came out late last yearwas completely blanked out is kaleidoscope important only to black people or will whites read it too mr hayden not only used his imagination in writing some of the biographical sketches but he expects us to believe him he says of miss brooks that she is considered bv some as a spokesman for her race miss brooks has had valuable things to say but she has said them as a poet not as a polemicist that is to say that one who is a polemicist cannot be a poet first we must not forget that to be black in this country is to be controversial and that polemics are associated with controversy second good poetry by nature of style and content can be polemic eg the chicago defender sends a man to little rock of leroi james he said much of jones poetry is in no legitimate sense racist and propagandist which is to say that a good portion of jones poetry is racist and propagandist for negro professors of literature it may appear to be that way but i suggest that mr hayden reread jones as a black poet and not as the type of poet he wishes him to be jones art is that of the present day black man and he sent that other art back to where it belongedgreece  bc all  jones is doing and very well i might add is telling the truth which is problack and it seems that the truth is not only offensive to mr hayden and others who try to cut jones up but also to a judge in new jersey if kaleidoscope is such an excellent title why should one need a subtitle to explain it mr hayden as a poet and teacher is i am sure  aware of the power of words and understands the motivating factors behind them in my estimation kaleidoscope will only attract people interested in lights colors and rainbows black people will not be moved to seek out such a title and most may not even know the meaning of the word kaleidoscope in content as in its title was established to appeal to white readers and to those readers who consider themselves near white which brings us to countee cullen who was so busy trying not to write black or negro that his only significance as a writer is that he was a good imitation white poet what did mr cullen contribute to black literature to read countee cullen is to read duplicates of robert hillyer john keats and a e housman mr cullen being the exact opposite of langston hughes who did create new forms and explore new ideas and who was able to grow and mature as he advanced in age and who left a great body of black literature which will enable other black writers to learn from and grow too most if not all black poets writing today feel that the word negro with its past and present denotations and connotations is not an accurate description of them or their work ie its an insult just like being called boy all your life evidently mr randall does not know the meaning of paying dues a few distinguished poems aint gone get it black poets like leroi jones are paying dues it is a perpetual thing like eating and dying no black person living today has paid his dues exceptmaybepaul robeson and for mr randall to remotely suggest that mr hayden has is simply a lie people like web du bois and malcolm_x paid dues i now question mr randalls awareness as to the position of the black man in this country is he sick dont quote voltaires political crap to me who mr randall defended web du bois and leroi jones right to say it who mr randall defended those students of the orangeburg sc massacre of  right to say it then again mr randall doesnt it depend upon what you are saying and to whom you are saying it that counts mr hayden doesnt have to worry about anyone trying to curtail his right to say it he knows what to saykaleidoscope if nothing else explicitly showed this leroi jones knew what to say too but he wanted to be a man don l lee chicago ill
