somebody on the ins £ side said once that i g politics is the art of the possible but for saemsm the £ack outsider in america politics in america has been the art of the impossible it has been the art of the impossible because it has been the art of trying to make a fundamental change in a political system by using the structures and instruments that were designed to perpetuate that system it has been the art of the impossible because it has been the art of trying to make a social revolution with moderate tools that were invented to prevent social revolutions it has been the art of the impossible because of the nature of politics which is the art of making some things impossible for outsiders and because of the extremity of the black mans situation which cannot be changed unless all things are made possible because of the black mans situation which is radical by any definition and because of the nature of american politics which is moderate to conservative by any definition the black man in america has been condemned to seek radical ends within a political framework which was designed to prevent sudden and radical social and economic changes for almost  years now the black outsiders of america have been squirming within the halters of this maddening dilemma during this period the representatives of the outsiders in the councils of the insiders have made striking gains as individuals but black people as a group have not been able to change their status and their social and economic conditions with political instruments and the question we must grapple with now is whether it will ever be possible to achieve fundamental social and economic change by the practice of politics as defined by the insiders the question nowand the question is radical because the times are radical and because our situation is radicalis whether politics is relevant to our contemporary crisis which cannot be resolved without political programs of a depth and dimension never before attempted in america is the old politicsthe politics of deals and trades and patronage the politics of place and privilege and individual advancementis the old politics relevant to the issues of bread for the millions and housing and education for the poor is politics relevant to the question of the redistribution of income and resources and the restructuring of the fundamental institutions of this society is politics relevant to black reality beyond all that beyond the specific problems of black people we must ask whether politics is relevant to white people 
is it relevant to the emptiness and hysteria and the unresolved social and economic problems in the white community can the old politics create white individuals who will not need racial scapegoats to solve their social and economic and sexual anxieties watts and newark and detroit put these questions on the agenda of american life in a very real sense these rebellions were devastating critiques of the american way of politics in rebellion the black people of america said that they were voting more and enjoying it less in rebellion the black people of america said that politics in america has failed them and that it is necessary now to create a new politics that can address itself to the real problems of this profoundly racist society it is against this background that we must view the question of the black mans role in american politics and in the light of these events and the history these events reflect we must say frankly that black people have no role in american politics black people are the outsiders the disinherited of the american political system as human beings they live outside white america in numerous black colonies and as voters and political persons they inhabit the margins on the periphery of the system even the persons who represent these outsiders in the councils of the insiders occupy a marginal positionas the adam powell and the thomas dodd cases indicated from time to time the inhabitants of these black colonies have played crucial roles as pawns of persons inside the system more significantly they have crucially affected the system by their presence on the periphery in other words they have acted on the system from a distance indeed one might say that the political history of america is a series of approaches and withdrawals from the pressing reality of the black outsiders on the margin in summation then the role of the black man outside american politics is the dual role of a political pawn for insiders and a protagonist from the outside of the whole political system in considering this dual role we have to deal with what j d b miller the political theorist calls the politics of the center and the circumference we have to deal in other words with a wwcolonial relation as kenneth clark noted in his book dark ghetto the dark ghettos are social political educational andabove alleconomic colonies their inhabitants are subject people victims of the greed cruelty insensitivity guilt and fear of their masters these colonies are controlled politically from the outside ultimate policymaking power lies in the hands of aliens who have their own representatives many of them black on the spot with power to see that the will of the white center is obeyed in the black circumference we must note also that the inhabitants of the center and the inhabitants of the circumference do not deal with each other directly black people and white people as gunnar myrdal noted deal with each other like two foreign countries through the medium of plenipotentiaries i say this with bluntness to emphasize the fact that when we talk about black politics we are not talking about ordinary politics and we are not talking about ordinary politics because the american political system has not created a single social community in which the reciprocal rules of politics would apply conventional politics cannot solve this problem because conventional politics is a part of the problem it is a part of the problem in the sense that the political system is the major bulwark of racism in america it is a part of the problem in the sense that the political system is structured to repel fundamental social and economic change we hear a great deal about the deficiencies real or imagined of certain black leaders but not enough attention it seems to me is paid to the framework within which they operate that framework prevents radical growth and innovationand it was designed to prevent radical growth and innovation what we have to deal with here is what arthur schlesinger jr called the paradox of power the fact that power within the system is necessary to do certain things but that power within the system makes it impossible to do most things when john f kennedy became president he was no political novice but he didnt realize schlesigner tells us how beautifully the government structure was organized to prevent anything from happening from the very beginning the american political structure has been beautifully organized to keep anything from happening we need not deal here with the theory that the constitutional convention was a conspiracy against the revolutionary ideals of the declaration of independence but it is obvious from a cursory examination of that document that the founding fathers were animated by a desire to protect property and privilege from sudden social experiments the theory of checks and balances for example is based on the theory that privilege must be protected from people thomas jefferson a large and wealthy slaveowner protested against the antipeople biases of the new government but he did not prevail and additional safeguards were later built into the system to protect the rising in dustrial directorate one of these safeguards of course was the twoparty system which was designed in part to filter out radicalism and to force dissent to express itself within two moderate channels insofar as the black man is concerned one can say of the two parties what a political insider said to lord bryce they are like two bottles of the same size the same color and the same shape with the same labelboth of them empty the criticisms i make here of politics in america could be extended to most political structures certainly of most political structures in the west governments cannot operate without support which means in practice that they must identify with certain interests in society and this means in america that government has usually identified with the interests of white people nothing illustrates this better than the central events in the political history of the negro contrary to the generally accepted idea that history began not in slavery but in indentured servitude the first black immigrants in english america landed at jamestown in august  they came these first black men and women the same way many perhaps most of the first white men cameunder  duress and compulsion they found a system which permitted poor people to pay for their passage by working a stipulated number of years as indentured servants in virginia then and in other colonies the first black immigrants fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic groove which carried with it no implications of racial inferiority during this transitional period of  years or more a period of primary importance in the history of america the first black immigrants mingled with whites on a basis of substantial equality black and whites worked in the same fields lived in the same huts and fraternized in the same places some perhaps most of the first black immigrants worked out their term of indentured servitude and were freed within a short time they were accumulating property pounds and indentured servants  the record indicates that these black settlers were accorded substantially the same rights as freed whites they voted in eleven of the thirteen original colonies and some of them became the first black officeholders in america by filling the minor posts of beadle and surety all this changed dramatically with the opening of the new world and the introduction of sugar planting in the west indies this new situation created a demand for men that could not be satisfied by the casual kidnapping of poor blacks in africa and poor whites in europe beginning around  the leading men of the colonies passed laws that made black people servants for life this was a fatal and perhaps irreparable break in the sense of community between black and white americans it was the starting point the first turn on the road to the summer of  and the dangers beyond this ominous decision was later made a part of the charter of america at the constitutional convention where northern delegates gave in to southern threats and wrote slavery into the constitution within a few years slavery had become a cancer in the heart of the american political system with incalculable results that are still re  sounding in the streets of america today during the whole of the slave period black people had no political history in the narrow sense of the term political but it is impossible to understand the political history of that period without reference to the black man although black men were disfranchised in both the north and south black people voted in every election influencing the political process by their presence and by the cause they embodied some black people voted with their feet by escaping in the tens of thousands from the south others acted on the political process as nonviolent abolitionist demonstrators it is a matter of record that great black abolitionists like frederick douglass and henry highland garent participated in the founding of the liberty and free soil parties both of which were forerunners of the republican party still another form of political action for the  slaves was violence as evidenced by the nat turner rebellion of  when all these currents linked up with that great american agitator  yankee selfinterest  the stage was set for the civil war emancipation and reconstruction it was during this period that black people came onstage and spoke lines in their own name for the first time and it was during this period that the seeds were sown for the political crisis of today the period began with a promising political revolution largely as a result of the radical political vision of two republican leaders representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senator charles sumner of massachusetts the freedmen were enfranchised and federal troops were sent into the south to protect them in the exercise of the fundamental rights of american citizens with the passage of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and a civil_rights act which was a great deal stronger than the act passed in  reconstruction came to a legal climax but this legislation so similar to the legislation of our day only touched the surface of the problem no one knew this better than the freedmen who saw clearly that it was necessary to complete the political revolution by a social revolution and what this meant in the context of that day was forty acres and a mule thaddeus stevens an old white man from pennsylvania who was the most powerful politician in washington and who was perhaps the most relevant politician in the political history of black americans made a valiant effort to give the radical reconstruction program the economic thrust it lacked but he was thwarted by the paradox of power after repeated attempts to push a radical land reform bill through congress stevens announced that the dream was stillborn he had fondly dreamed he said in a house speech that when any fortunate chance should have broken up for a while the foundations of our institutions and released us from obligations the most tyrannical that ever man imposed in the name of freedom that american institutions would have been so remodeled as to have freed them from every vestige of human oppression of inequality of rights or recognized degradation of the poor and the superior caste of the rich but alas he said bowing to the inherent limitations of the system this bright dream has vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision the failure of that dreamthe refusal of the political leaders of america to ground political freedom on economic freedom doomed reconstruction and paved the way to our present crisis before the curtain that lifted for a moment dropped black men and their white allies carried the south and the black man to heights of democracy that have not yet been equalled in this republic during the heyday of reconstruction from  to  black men served in the legislature of every southern state and in south carolina during this period black men had a majority in the legislature in every session save one black people also sent  representatives to the house of representatives and two black men were elected to the u s senate from the state of mississippi there were also treasurers secretaries of state and superintendents of education in mississippi south carolina louisiana and florida and for a brief period the brilliant black politician p b s pinchback served as governor of the state of louisiana despite mistakes which were inevitable under the circumstances black people made large strides in renovating the political structures of the south people who say that black_power is simply white power in blackface ought to think long and hard about the reconstruction period black people had considerable power in south carolina mississippi louisiana where they constituted a majority of the population and a majority of the registered voters the record indicates that the black reconstruction governments gave poor and middle class white people rights aristocratic whites had denied them not only that black people in perhaps their greatest contribution created in the south what had never existed before a public school system supported by public taxation perhaps the most important development of this period was the expansion of the political horizons of black people since politics was real since it was an activity that corroborated reality and promised to change reality black people gave to politics the kind of attention their children and grandchildren would give to entertainment and religion black people lived in that faraway and mystical period in a primary relation with power they turned out in the thousands for political meetings and they followed politics day by day month by month throughout the year reconstruction was a supreme lesson the right reading of which might still mark a turning point in our history for  years in this country for  months men tried  democracy black people and white people married each other in the southand the world did not end little black boys and little white girls went to school togetherand the confederate dead did not rise did not in fact make a sound at all although the klan said they were turning in their graves all over the south in these years blacks and whites shared streetcars restaurants hotels honors dreams the sun rose and the sun set and the constitution of the united states had some meaning from maine to mississippifor  years reconstruction was a lesson first of all for black politicians it demonstrated clearly the need for bold honest and imaginative leadership and it established beyond doubt the black mans right to participate in power on the debit side it can be said that many of the black leaders of reconstruction were too anxious to prove that they could live up to the anglosaxon idea they were too anxious to prove that they could do what white politicians could do even more decisive was the failure of the black leaders of reconstruction to mobilize a black_power base and to remain in close touch with the cottonroots of their constituencies too many men then as now were living too far away from the people they said they were representing we need not concern ourselves here with the myth of corruption men used to overthrow these governments the black leaders of reconstruction were not overthrown because they were corrupt they were overthrown because they couldnt shoot in a very significant failure of the american political system the reconstruction governments were overthrown by an open and violent revolution and this open and violent revolution was legitimized by the compromise of  a political bargain which gave rutherford b hayes the presidency in exchange for a suspension of constitutional safeguards which protected black voters in the south backed by every structure of power in the north the south pushed black people back towards slavery by a white terrorist campaign which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people and this campaign of terror was sanctioned by the supreme court which sucked the meaning out of the fourteenth amendment and invalidated the reconstruction civil_rights laws black people protested they organized protests and called on the president but nobody was listening and nobody really cared the democratic party was openly hostile then and there was no real alternative for black people who continued to vote republican out of habit and out of despair black people were driven from power in the south by terror and fraud but individual republicans  managed to hold on to power for several years in several states and black voters sent representatives to southern legislatures and congressmen to washington until the dawn of the twentieth century as the years wore on the area of black expressiveness narrowed and by world war i it was considered subversive for black men to hold public office the violent overthrow of reconstruction set the stage for the great migration to the north which began around  and continues today like the various immigrant groups black people were soon organized into political machines but these machines were composed of mutually hostile groups pursuing a politics of patronage and stalemate within the boundaries of this situation black people could veto openly hostile policies but they could not translate voting power into fundamental group gains as a result black people were penetrated by feelings of political powerlessness since politics had no relevance to their agony since it was not an activity with which they could lift themselves they began to look on it with indifference worse some black people came to see politics as a marketable activity involving the trading of votes for petty political favors for all that political involvement brought some gains at least to individuals in  oscar de priest inaugurated a new era by becoming the first black congressman from the north and the first black congressman in america since the turn of the century de priest was elected as a republican from the first congressional district of chicago six years later arthur mitchell became the first democratic congressman by winning election from the same district after  black politicians republican and democratic were elected to the legislatures of most northern states and the border states of kentucky and west virginia they also filled elective or appointive positions in the public service of every major city the disaster of the depression widened the political alternatives in america and with the coming of the new deal black people deserted the republican party and gave their votes and their hearts to the politics of the welfare state after world war ii and the internationalization of the race problem the political horizons of the black community widened there was a new and ominous restlessness in the black community and negro protest organizations began to mobilize mass pressures the government responded to this new mood by intervening dramatically on behalf of black americans in the fifties and sixties a series of supreme court decisions and civil_rights acts reopened the national compromise of  black people began to vote again in substantial numbers in the south and in the south and north black people were named or elected to unprecedented political positions by  it was possible to speak of the beginning of the second reconstruction this period of political growth brought striking gains particularly in the black middle class but the record shows that black people as a whole lost ground relative to whites in  the rate of unemployment for negroes and whites to use president johnsons figures was about the same thirtyfive years later the negro rate was twice as high to continue with the figures president johnson cited in his  speech at howard university  in  the eight per cent unemployment rate for negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites by last year  the rate had grown to  per cent as against  per cent for whites between  and  the income of negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country from  to  the median income of negro families compared to white actually dropped from  per cent to  per cent since  the number of white families living in poverty has decreased  per cent while the number of poor nonwhite families decreased only  per cent the infant mortality of nonwhites in  was  per cent greater than whites twentytwo years later it was  per cent greater moreover the isolation of negroes from white communities is increasing rather than decreasing as negroes crowd into the central cities and become a city within a city this is a record of failure despite political success and it has led to a general crisis of confidence in the fairness of the american political system a voteless people a national fraternity used to say is a hopeless people we know now from the example of chicago and watts and detroit that a voting people can also be a hopeless people and i think it is incumbent upon all black americans in the light of this knowledge to rethink their relation to american politics i have suggested here that conventional politics is designed to prevent fundamental change i have also suggested that it is impossible to meet the fundamental needs of black people without a social revolution if these hypotheses are correctand i offer the whole history of america as evidenceit is incumbent upon us to either revitalize conventional politics or abandon conventional politics  a new politics is necessary in america because the old politics has failed us and the salvation of the black man in this country and the creation of democracy in this country depend to a very great extent on the creation of a new political vision in the black community we must make a radical reevaluation of all our traditional political alliances in the light of the needs and the interests of the overwhelming majority of black people black representatives must dare now to redefine themselves in terms of the interests of their people they must ask themselves who they are and who they really represent and if their ultimate allegiance is to the black community and not to the democratic party or the republican party or labor or some white political boss they must dare to make that allegiance real by creating independent power bases in the black community at the same time black people must assume responsibility for the financing of the campaigns of black candidates they must come together as a group and provide independent bases for a new and independent politics the most urgent need of this hour is the political education of black people they must be made aware of their political and economic interests and the general nature of the opposition beyond all that it is necessary to make black people recognize their unity with others in the same situation it may be necessary for some people to operate as democrats and republicans but black people should realize that their real need is results not names the socalled alienation of the urban black voter is based i suspect on a very sophisticated analysis of the american political system black people by and large dont believe politics can bring about a realthat is to say effectivechange in their basic situation if the black masses are to rise to the requirements of this hour they must be shown that politics is their affair and in their fundamental interests bayard rustin has said that the civil_rights movement must become political i would add that the political movement must become a civil_rights movement i believe the relevant black politician must carry off the difficult feat of blending the traditional political skills with the skills of the reformer it is encouraging to note that this process is well underway in michigan for example a black mayor threatened to resign over a human rights issue and when the political process failed in wisconsin black officeholders redefined their roles and went to jail another indication of this same process was the skillful talkin staged by illinois legislators i believe it will be necessary in the future to extend this process for  years white politicians have used the whole range of parliamentary weapons to deny black people human rights it is time now i think for black officeholders to use the whole range of parliamentary weapons in a nonviolent campaign within the political process this would be a service not only to black americans but also to white americans for black people embody the most advanced social and economic interests of this society and action on behalf of their interests is action also in behalf of the real interests of whites today as in  black people embody the truth of the declaration of independence and the mission of the black politician is to do what white politicians have failed to do define and actualize liberty and equality as a faith and a way of life  in the final analysis as emmett john hughes pointed out the art of politics is the subtle and sensitive attuning and discipling of all words and deedsnot to mend the petty conflict of the moment nor to close some tiny gap in the discourse of the daybut to define and to advance designs and policies for a thousand tomorrows and that is the historic mission of the black politician today the advancing of designs and policies for a thousand tomorrows for blacks and whites 
born as smoke still hovered over the rubble of the nations worst not detroits militant federation for selfdetermination at first seemed fated to help prevent future confidently its members fires proclaimed themselves part of the new black establishment this establishment included fiery black nationalist minister rev albert cleage jr bearded college radicals graysuited intellectuals and grimeyed activists from the socalled black underground and suddenly rev cleage and the others were everywhere urging black control of the black community on scores of television programs and haranguing sweaty crowds at dozens of emotional unity rallies that was last fall this past spring as gunbuying continued at an alltime high in both the suburbs and city the federation quietly expired its demise was vaguely attributed to the desire of members for new alliances and to work on individual projects actually a combination of forces had sapped the groups strength lack of financial support probably was most damaging to the federation but internal feuding clannishness and fogginess of purpose all contributed to its decline most observers here agree more significantly detroit contributed incredible rumor after incredible rumor concerning the aims of black nationalists was swallowed whole by a white community hungry for scapegoats the rumor kept alive most persistently in the suburbs was that black guerrillas planned to invade outlying areas this summer and kill the firstborn in every family but most whites were wellprepared for them it has been estimated that about onethird of suburban dwellings contain some kind of firearms and that  new permits for hand guns will be issued in the metropolitan detroit area this year the white communitys generally belligerent response to the disturbance of last summer is credited with increasing the federations difficulty in obtaining needed support from white industrialists politicians and foundations and disenchantment with the liberal white establishment was apparent during the federations final cut and dried meeting the meeting had been delayed nearly two hours as the groups mostly youthful membership straggled in after huddling in little knots in the hallways rev cleage was over an hour late but once seated his face carefully blank he became the focal point of eyes it had been his dream it had not withstood the stresses from both within and without there were few moments of drama no peaks of excitement to the meeting with no particular inflection to his voice lorenzo freeman federation vicechairman stated that the board of directors after reassessing the groups purposes had recommended that it be dissolved a motion for dissolution then was proposed by young attorney kenneth cockrel of the association of black students it was quickly approved a hint of the conflict said to have plagued the group suddenly flashed into view like an ugly word scrawled on a wall members voted down a suggestion that the federation retain a skeleton structure that would bear its name and solicit funds in the hope of the groups eventual rebirth they opted instead for legal dissolution if theres ever any need for us to come together again we will one young man flung out but the process of dissolution was well underway before the april  meeting at any rate wayne state universitys dr karl gregory had resigned as executive director in march at that time it was revealed that the federation had little over  in its treasury dr gregory continued to offer his services to the group on a voluntary basis but this alone could not reverse the dark course of events a person close to the organization blamed its collapse on the industrydominated new detroit committees failure to offer financing without strings they had an opportunity to make this a meaningful movement he said now all that has happened is that the real militant movement in this community has gone back underground if the aims of the federation are not realized it can only be blamed on those who failed to make available the necessary funds for its operation the federation spurned a    grant from the new detroit committee after the committee decided to fund a moderate negro group as well and stipulated that the federation cooperate with this group yet this was not the sole cause of its troubles a young militant bitterly spoke of the lack of integrity and the personal ambitions of those who had the responsibility of making the federation operative anyone who questions the integrity or possible lack of it in individuals within a group of course is on shaky ground but it is a fact that certain members of the federation doubted the dedication of other members in private conversations it was alleged that a member of the board of directors was continuing to receive his salary from another job while being paid by the federation it was further alleged that another officials financial irresponsibility helped deplete the groups already scanty funds people outside the group complained that it was clannish and insular the same little clique always runs the whole damn show snorted one woman who has been prominent in activist causes a disgruntled federation member alluded to the same issue during the final meeting maybe the problem is this organization has been too much us here and not enough the people out there another problem may have been the groups lack of a clearcut program for action the stress going instead to calls for black solidarity black consciousness and black pride selfdetermination was a goal yes but any new complex of ghettocontrolled cooperative apartments and supermarkets would have required the initial support of white industrialists the only major activity sponsored by the federation during its short span was a malcolm_x day memorial which raised  for malcolms widow so for whatever the reasons detroit faces this years long hot summer just as illprepared as it was last year the big rumor stalking the streets of the ghetto is that armed white nuts will provoke an incident leading to a riot so that they can destroy the inner city presently no group and no individual stands as a buffer against these fears the glaring vacuum of leadership exposed by the insurrection of  has not been filled as the detroit contingent of the poor peoples march discovered recently when they were trampled upon by mounted policemen downtown no one took up the cause of the poor and no one is capitalizing on the acceptance of a militant approach by many middleclass negroes meanwhile many black people are looking forward to a bigger and better rebellion this summer according to a recent survey by prominent local psychiatrist dr paul lowinger 
i am not looking for any oversimplified answer to the question who am i it is obvious by now that i am not going to be a great white american dancer but i have little patience with people who suggest that to be a black choreographer one must limit his scope and deal exclusively with traditional afroamerican material the question of an artists identity is one that he continually asks he asks it through his chosen medium by experimentally probing into different aspects of his identity and environment whether one functions as a choreographer who also happens to be black or as a black man who happens to be a choreographer is determined by his point of view at a given moment the ideal point of view at any given moment for the individual artist is the one which best allows him to create the most profoundly exciting art if he cannot produce beautiful and exciting art there is no point in discussing his political or ideological commitments in relation to art the militant black revolutionary may think of art in terms of the whole machinery of the revolution as a means of bringing forth the rich heritage of the african in america and to create a sense of identity for the sake of the revolution most of the existing dance companies which are the instruments of black choreographers have placed their emphasis on traditional afroamerican material they are exploring through their artistry the proud afroamerican heritage and they can evoke poignant images which will encourage intolerance of racial suppression but these images are not the only means of communicating a black consciousness while traditional black art is playing a vital role in the awakening of a black cultural identity now it is equally important for black artists to discourage the crystalization of new stereotype limitations by not confining themselves to oversimplified traditional images  i am not suggesting that black artists should or could cut themselves off from afroamerican tradition artist or layman our past experience inevitably affects our articulation of present ideas but if an artists individual sense of immediacy is to vitalize his work he should have freedom to decide which ideas he feels a need to communicate at a particular time artists have felt compelled to create images which called for social changes long before their own people were ready to initiate them otherwise one might never be moved to focus his art on sociohistoric events it is not a question of art for arts sake it is a need to be true to ones own feelings though masterpieces have been created on commissionwith the idea of fulfilling some sponsors visioninfinitely more poor art has been produced by artists who were working with ideas about which they had no deep feelings an artists assumption that he knows exactly what his audience needs often results in art that is at best patronizing the highest compliment an artist can give his audiences is to invite them to witness his exploration of the maximum possibilities of his art based on his total experience the dance that i do is afroamerican simply because i am afroamerican my blackness is part of my identity as a human being and my dance exploration is evolving in relation to my total experience as a man it is simply a question of what is more important in the act of creatingmy total living experiences or those experiences which i consider particularly relevant to my blackness the myth that afroamericans function well only in certain predictable areas is one that both white and black americans have long been conditioned to accept and it must be dispelled the black artists refusal to confine his work to convenient categories will contribute to the destruction of this limited notion each dance i create has grown out of my personal experience as a black american each movement i explore is part of my own personal heritage my emphasis is on exploring through my medium experimenting with dance trying to find fresh ways of evoking physical and spiritual images to make new poetic comments about mans eternal beauty and pathos my function in the revolution will be to share my personal experience through dance a vital and growing experience not to show only old stereotypes or to create new ones

as slave a black j a £ woman was woman jr f power instead of woman she was more important as a laborer than as a wife or mother this is still true today today when the average american woman has more freedom than ever before in history to choose her personal path to happiness and selffulfillmentwhether as wife mother artist teacher reformer or as anything and all things she may desirethe american black woman remains a slave to economic necessity the american woman struck a sharp blow for her own independence when she gained societys approval for working outside her home that was one battle the black woman didnt have to fight it was never thought unseemly for her to work in fact for a long time the proportion of black women who held jobs was twice that of white women who  worked although since the s more and more white women have been partaking of the privilege of working still today a larger percentage of black women hold jobssome  per cent in  compared with  per cent of white women it is not in history however that we will find the real disparity between white and black woman workers but in todays facts and figures white women today may work to fulfill themselves to fill their days or to earn extra spending money but as information gathered by the department of labor the bureau of the census and other us government agencies shows the black woman works because she has to how do we know lets look first at the jobs at which black women work only people who have to would work as household maids or cooks porters janitresses hospital attendants cooks helpers bus girls or as any of a number of other menial service personnel yet over onehalf of all black women workers held these jobs in  not only do such service workers encounter some hard unpleasant labor they also earn salaries lower than those for any other jobs generally below  a year add to hard work and low pay the absence from most of these positions of such fringe benefits as paid vacations job security or health insurance enjoyed by workers in other fields and you know for sure that few people would take these jobs out of choice in fact few white women do black women although they are only a tiny part of the entire labor force hold nearly twothirds of these lowstatus lowpaying jobs glance higher up the feminine career ladder and see how quickly the proportion of black women drops the percentage of black women in clerical and sales jobs is onethird that of white women in the professions whites outnumber blacks proportionally almost two to one and when teaching the career of many black professional women is excluded the blackwhite imbalance is greater still and the black woman is out of work and looking for it more often than the white womanin  the unemployment rate for black women was twice that for white women now if she didnt have to have a job would she consider herself out of one when she wasnt working hardly if she cant as we have seen find a job that satisfies her soul does she at least have a job that fattens her purse it should come as no surprise that the black woman is the lowest paid person in the us labor force her  average salary of  a weekwas lower even than that for black men and of course way below the national average lest you wonder the black woman doesnt work to fill her days either she takes outside jobs when other important demands are placed on her time and energy for instance although the majority of white women do not work after marriage nearly half the black women workers are married and even more revealing of the black womans need to work is that although few white women work when they have young children over onethird of the black women do the black woman cannot afford to stay at home with her children the black woman obviously does not want to work in a poor job she must take what she can get with an education cut short most often by financial need for as you can see the black woman does not choose to work she must work because her family must have her income her family may look to her for support because she is the head of the household about onequarter of all black families were headed by a woman alone in  but less than onetenth of all white families were half of these women work fulltime many others hold parttime jobs even if she is married she is more often than a white wife the sole earner in the family for the unemployment rate among black married men is twice that among white husbands or she may as do over half of  all black wives work to help her husband keep their familys head above water that is she works not to bring in extra income but to bring in enough over onethird of the families in america with incomes below the poverty level are black with only one earner male or female the average black familys income is barely above that level one extra earnermost often a woman  adds about  to the black familys income and still does not bring it up to the income of an average white family with one earner the black woman works alone or with her husband because she must to keep her family out of poverty youre right of coursethere may well be other reasons for her working she may just want to get out of her house which is probably far from being the american homemakers dream come true in  over onequarter of all black families were living in dilapidated or deteriorating housing the black homemaker hasnt money in her budget to fix up her home and she doesnt have the right color skin to move her family into a better neighborhood or too she may work to build a personal nest egg in case her marriage breaks apartand the chances that it will are many times greater than if she and her husband were white her life as a mother is also one that she might well want to escape motherhood can hardly be a joy with too many kids too little money a poor neighborhood bad schools and often no man in the house still underlying all these factors is the same financial need forcing black women to work of course we cannot ignore the fact that many black women have won tremendous success as workers in the professions the arts and in governmental or other careers these women may well work out of choice and for personal satisfaction but they are the exception not the rule among black workers nor can we exclude from these considerations the increasing number of black women who find themselves protected from want in the middle class with decent homes working husbands and the luxury of leisure many of these women still do work though to pay for their privileges the nonworkers among them cannot alter the generally bleak picture the statistics outline for most black women as more black families rise into the middle class more sink deeper into poverty the black leisure class is growing but still small and the nonworking black woman remains in a minority while a majority of her white sisters can afford leisure the average black woman as we have seen is forced to work because she is black in this country she is a slave to economic necessity and her vital economic role all but eclipses her roles as a woman now i am not saying that because she is a woman in america she should be forced to fit some socially prescribed mold of the typical happy american woman she may want to work she may want to combine many roles as do so many other american women she has a right to as full or as narrow a life as she chooses but she herself should be able to choose the path her life will follow only in choice is there freedom now the black woman has no choice now as for over  years she is forced to work until she can pick a pattern for her life herself she will remain a slave 
drkenneth b clark is a scholar of the first magnitude when he comments on blackwhite relationships people listen his work on questions of the socialpsychological effects of discrimination have justly given him a nationwide reputation so that when he discusses such a vital question as black_power and its effects on interracial rapport one can expect his audience to weight seriously the positions he takes and the recommendations he advances it is precisely because of the respect with which he is held that the present remarks seek to reopen the question which dr clark recently attemptedor so it seemsto close in rather summary fashion i refer to his address given on october   at the annual meeting of the association for the study of negro life and history held in greensboro north carolina and subsequently reprinted in the january  issue of the journal of negro history  my remarks are not designed to offend or belittle dr clarks ideas rather they are intended to pursue a question of vital importance to negroes and whites alike i must confess to being greatly disturbed by dr clarks address in greensboro and my subsequent reading of his paper has not lessened my uneasiness in the least i can heartily concur in his statement that the problems of the american negro are problems of america and that the negro remains the essential psychological reality with which america must continuously seek to come to terms   moreover his suggestion that discrimination as practiced by insecure american whites is a psychological protection shaped and perpetuated by the dominant majority is also a most penetrating and cogent point and finally i agree that the walls of segregation are not only humiliatingbut given this type of chronic humiliation there develops selfdoubt subtle and flagrant forms of selfhatred personal and group frustrations internalized hostility aggressions selfdenial or bombast having found these important areas of agreement with dr clarks statements i must now take serious issue with his other points the overriding import of his paper is to advocate total and immediate integration as a means of resolving the nations racial problems as a scholar of and an activist in the twentiethcentury civil_rights movement i applaud this objective however  deeply regret dr clarks assumptions that this goal can be achieved only by the complete rejection of the concepts and the efforts of black_power advocates in his remarks he makes no efforts to define black_power he gives no legitimacy to that phenomenon he affords it no chance to be heard nor does he try in the slightest to assess and analyze its several dimensions in fact he dismisses it out of hand as a negative and disruptive force the social scientist should make every effort to gather and evaluate his data in objective fashion on the question of black_power dr clark hasat least in the paper presently under discussiontotally failed to do just that he refers to black_power as ambiguous as possessing a nowin premise as being programmatically empty and pragmatically futile and yet he admits the tremendous psychological appeal which it has for the negro masses how can a social scientist cavalierly reject so important a phenomenon without making every effort to examine its substance dimensions and potential my remarks are intended as neither a defense nor a criticism of black_power they are designed simply to counter an intellectual position that would stifle objective discussion and repress analysis of a force in american life that fully merits open examination and serious consideration it seems to me that dr clark is wrong in assuming that black_power is merely a defensive mechanism grounded on hatred of white america and selfhatred among negroes and that its utility is of dubious value if nothing else the advocates of black_power certainly deserve an opportunity to be heard and to be taken seriously in positive terms dr clark admits that the situation for the masses of american negroes continues to deteriorate and yet he persists in believing that remedies of a traditionally approved natureinterracial cooperation to achieve redress through legislation the courts advanced employment opportunities and the likeare the only means to secure a full remedy does this not impose upon the negro whose position is already so difficult in this society the obligation of playing the game only by the white mans rules is it really so inconceivable that new and varied approaches might be tried simultaneously with the customary interracial efforts they need not be mutually exclusive what would prevent this nation if it really had the best interests of all in mind from advancing the cause of racial justice in a number of ways through varied techniques at one and the same time for over one hundred years black americans have played the game by the white mans rules and they have not yet won their full share of this nations promise this does not negate the possibility that they may yet do so nor does it deny the chance that they might do so more rapidly with a variety of strategies including black_power one is reminded for example of the very cogent article by william b hixson in the autumn  issue of the american scholarin which he suggested that traditional commitments to law and order simply meant the formulation of a series of  rules which protected and reinforced the position of the dominant elements in the society and thereby made more difficult any serious efforts for basic change and longrange reform one need not be against law and order to see that they can at the hands of a dominant majority have repressive manifestations and consequences for an aggrieved minority and if one relies only as apparently dr clark would prefer on a coalition of interested negroes and whites bent on achieving racial justice through interracial cooperation does not one run the risk of being in the very position of young claude brown and his father when they were represented by a white lawyer supposedly seeking damage charges on their behalf against a transit company following the incident in which young clark was struck by a bus in manchild in the promised land claude brown recalled his immediate suspicions well supported by subseqeunt events of the white lawyer in question  and when he the white lawyer started talking to menot really talking to me just saying the stupid things that white people say to little colored boys with a smile on their faces and the little colored boys are supposed to smile toonothing in the world could have made me believe that cat was on our side we werent even people to him so how the hell was he going to fight our fight i wanted to ask dad why he went and got this guy but i knew why    anybody could see that this cat wasnt so smart no he was just luckylucky that the world had dumb niggers like dad in it is there really any more reason to assume that even the bestintentioned white liberal is in longrange and fundamental terms better able than was this white lawyer to fight the black mans fight there are specific and necessary tasks in the struggle for racial justice that must be performed by negroes themselves on behalf of negroes and this does not in any way smack of racism or hatred for american whites if dr clark is to be believed and taken at his word on the basis of the essay in question he has given no credence to this fact indeed one sees little indication that he has considered it at all dr clark acts as though he does not understand and is not aware of the statements made by black_power advocates about what policies they would advance he talks merely as if they were bent on hatred and destruction this is not the case as clark could see from a reading of stokely carmichaels essay in the september   issue of the new york review of books in that instance carmichael clearly emphasized that black_power was not a form of race hatred rather he stressed the need for white people to cooperate in giving black americans a chance to set their own goals and achieve their own objectives by developing a sufficiently solid economic and political base through which they could participate fully in matters affecting them and in the total pattern of american life this is hardly withdrawal it is rather a deliberate and conscious attempt to meet the problems of negro americans in very direct and positive fashion it merits a serious and open hearing and a chance to be tried it will require enormous effort patience and endurance for american negroes to implement black_power in meaningful terms they deserve an opportunity to do so it will take an extraordinary amount of understanding and patience for the dominant white majority to get out of the way and accord negroes this opportunity therein of course lies much of the problem the dominant white majority cannot readily sustain the psychic damage it would face if it truly recognized how corrosive its values and actions have been for black americans it will demand a profound commitment to racial justice for the american white to admit the grave injustices that his system and his leadership have visited upon the black minority once that awareness works its way to a conscious level however then the dominant majority might be willing as it ultimately must beto step back and allow black americans to define their own goals seek their fulfillment and in so doing redefine the landmarks and the guideposts that have customarily marked the path of interracial relations in this country this is what black_power seeks and whether or not its advocates are able to achieve it they fully deserve the occasion to make the effort unfortunately dr clark seems unwilling to accord them that fundamental chance dr clark argues that negroes and whites must cooperate to eradicate the intolerable aspects of ghetto life segregated schools inadequate housing job discrimination the sale and distribution of inferior merchandise the filth and drabness of ghetto streets and the repressive conduct of the police in ghetto neighborhoods black_power advocates share this goal too clark urges experimentation and the use of human intelligence and training in the development of constructive solutions to these problems here again black_power advocates concur what they are saying however is that these goals and objectives should be sought in a number of ways one of which includes policy formulation and implementation by negroes themselves is it really so unthinkable that this should be tried is it really so inconceivable that it might work and that by working it might make a genuine contribution to the overall solution to the racial problem in america by rejecting the possibilities of black_power dr clark really does himself as a social scientist the negro americans as a depressed minority and the nation at large as a troubled society a grave disservice he adopts the same type of negativism and repression that he has so long fought dr clark seems to close his mind to the potentials of black_power on the grounds that it represents a racist solution this is in no sense the case in their recent book black_power the politics of liberation in america stokely carmichael and charles v hamilton have given the lie to this assumption there is no reason to equate black_power with the racism of white supremacists the former seeks positive solutions leading to a strengthened and stable negro community that can take full advantage with whites of the promise of american life the latter is and has been motivated by hatred and the concept of perpetual racial separatism there is no parallel whatever between black_power and white supremacy in their motivations conduct and goals as carmichael and hamilton have explained the goal of the racists is to keep black people on the bottom arbitrarily and dictatorially as they have done in this country for over three hundred years the goal of black selfdetermination and black selfidentityblack_poweris full participation in the decisionmaking processes affecting the lives of black people and the recognition of the virtues in themselves as black people the black people of this country have not lynched whites bombed their churches murdered their children and manipulated laws and institutions to maintain oppression     dr clark has failed to make this necessary distinction and yet it is a difference which is absolutely crucial for both the social scientist and the american layman to understand and accept if we are to fashion new instruments functionally positive instruments that will help us allblack and whiteto resolve the terrible dilemma of racial oppression in this country black_power may not be the answer certainly it is not the only approach which this society can and must take but the advocates of black_power deserve a hearing and the chance to make an honest effort their potential contributions merit the recognition and support of the nation at large such openness by the dominant majority is after all the true test of a free and democratic society it seems incredible that a nation grounded on the values of risktaking and innovation should seem so reluctant to accord the american negro this vital opportunity to make a series of efforts on his own behalf initially to the possible benefit of us all in longrange terms if black_power were given its day there is no reason why fullscale and active interracial cooperation could not proceed simultaneously there is no reason why a variety of strategies could not be implemented to meet a complex range of racial problems americas racial difficulties are sufficiently numerous and perplexing and the size and resources of the nation sufficiently ample that we can and should sustain for example a stokely carmichael a floyd mckissick a ralph abernathy a roy wilkins and a whitney young at one and the same time pluralism in action means just that in an open society to deny such a possibility as dr clark seems to do is to give away the ball game before we have even taken to the field that would be totally inexcusable

that pernicious and wayward white lady lula in dutchman says she wants clay to have his manhood says she wants him to be a bad nigger what she doesnt know is that clay is already a bad nigger already has his manhood a manhood more potent than anything this silly white girl ever imagined when clay reveals himself to be a true man a black man who has no use for her kind she has only one alternative to deny that he exists or ever existed for not to do so would cause some seismic trembling in one of the universal laws you know the one that says niggers sambos uncle ts colored boys and wouldbe black men whose manhood is bestowed upon them by the merciful great white woman can exist but true black men cannot and so lula not prepared to alter the natural order in an effort to refuse him meaningful space stabs clay in the back this is what happened to marse william styron when he looked up and discovered nat turners manhood turner was so beautiful so black so together with his person and his people that marse styron set outdeliberately mind you to kill him to hide him away to pretend that he never existed this is the sick italian iago bringing the beautiful black othello down this is the white crackerpoliceman in an alley shooting some fleeing nigger boy in the back this is the dream of western civilization the black man never existed that marse willie styron distorted the character of the historic nat turner is an accepted fact see for example william styrons nat turner ten black writers respond published by beacon press but styron attempted to kill to obliterate a complete historical and political tradition of black people that tradition being this black people was and is a rebellious people ostensibly it seems that styron is favoring this tradition by making a black rebellion the subject of his major preoccupation a close examination however shows that his whole intent is rather to destroy that tradition completely unlike most white people who go around smugly halfbelieving that blacks as slaves never revolted styron leaps into the mouth of a black revolt takes out his can of white paint and goes to work when he is finished the thing is perfectly camouflaged against the equally white landscape which is americas sick white mind nat turners revolt taken in its simplest form was a political act an act that should be and it certainly is inspiration for his people today and this is what styron was afraid of so he avoided the political implications of the revolt by reducing the affair to a level of psychological stereotypes which has   the added advantage of making this strange tale plausible to whites it is this psychological stress in the novel that makes styrons nat sound like some sensitive faggish art major whenever he opens his mouth this is why every time styron alias thomas gray pops a political question like why did he nat kill joseph travis who was a good slavemaster the answer to such a question is obviously because he is a white m f  and there is no such thing as a good slavemaster this is a political response but styrons nat is not capable of that his response is psychological due to his extreme sensitivity for a moment i was so surprised that i couldnt speak i sat down slowly then the surprise became perplexity and i was silent for a long time saying finally even then thatthat l cant give no reply to mr gray page  confessions before the novel is over styron comes right out and calls nat and his revolt a flatassed failure p  and do you think nat gives him a political response back telling this cracker that there is no such thing as an unsuccessful black revolt because every time a black fist raises over a white head we are just that much closer to overcoming the vipers every white throat cut is a success in itself but styrons nat doesnt have a brain doesnt have an ideology his head  has been addled with sensitivity and so his response is i felt myself shivering as i gazed downward between my legs at the plank floor and at the links of cold cast iron sagging like a huge rusting timber chain in the chill dim light suddenly i felt the approach of my own death    my hands trembled my bones ached  i heard grays voice    pp  this cats nothing but a bundle of nerves styron used this extreme sensitivity bit as a smoke screen behind which to hide the political implications of turners revolt consider the following statement a black leader and some black followers killed  of their white oppressors from the point of view of black people this is a beautiful artistic statement and it is artistic because it unifies all sociological economical political etc implications of these black people it implies that these people are fighting a common enemy it implies brotherhood love and trust among these people it is a positive heroic inspiring optimistic statement it says a lot that only black people can understand its black poetry it is otherwise when a white man reads this statement first it is not a reality to white people that they can be killed by blacks in the free world the price of white life is very expensive and that of black life dirt cheap it is a tacit understanding between the gangs around the woodlawn area in chicago and the police that the gangs can take the lives of little nigger children but if they kill a white student for example from the university of chicago somebody has to payand it doesnt matter who as long as he is black nat turner stands in black history as one who didnt look at the price tag when he revolted he didnt give a damn who was a good or important cracker he went out to slaughter the white oppressor period and so he did styrons book is not a meditation on history its a meditation on the political implications of this simple statement some black men killed their white oppressors styron seeks to soften the hard impact of such political implication by expanding that simple statement into  pages he set out to change the speed of a rifle bullet headed for some honkies brain into the soft drop of a tear shed for the miserable state of those colored people set out to change the flying crash of a flaming molotov into the familiar thump of the sunday newspaper thrown by the local colored boy the success of this attempt can be attested to by the fact that when one finishes the book he finds it difficult to believe even if he is black that real black men cut real throats for their freedom one finds that styron has worked some wicked magic the fact is changed into a phantasy the action into a reaction the black into white and you into a fool a fool because no black person needs to know what went on in nats mind he has only to consult his own status in life to know that white liberals like styron always want to know the black man but when they say they want to know what happened in nats mind they are assuming that the statement some black people killed their white oppressors is meaningless a black leader like nat doesnt begin to mean anything until they are told that he has a white mind and that all the influences in his life were white it is only then that he becomes a significant leader and so they gradually begin to know him the assumption behind this is of course only white really exists if l dont imagine myself a black man styron said to himself as he painted his face with black paint how am i ever going to know that black people exist one certainly cant take their word for it in short styrons confessions of nat turner is a deliberate attempt not to see the political reality of black people it is an attempt not to see the thousands of nat turners in the ghettos of hundreds of american cities it is an act of negative hallucination thats what the psychiatrists call itin an effort to pretend that black people are not a rebellious people the book seeks to deny the obvious political connection between nats revolt and the revolt of black people today indeed the two revolts are different only in the sense that lovers are different styron belongs to a tradition of southern writers that gives the impression of actually dealing with the problem of black and white relations when what in fact it does is attack any new reality that threatens its nostalgic southern order in its avoidance of real issues this tradition connects withand gains support fromthe artforarts sake school and this is how you get those stupid university of chicago types who want to see the novel just as a work within itself this is fidgeting art and propaganda styron represents the white mans last futile attempt to overhaul his shottohell and fagged moral psychic this man is desperate now he will do anything to absolve himself of his guilty past whenever there is a riot white liberals choke on their fright and guilt this is as it should be so it is understandable why they are willing to believe those huge lies styron tells in his book white people are beginning to realize that the oppressor is immoral and that the liberator is moral and free and hence beautiful this is after all a very recent idea for during the th century and the early th it was widely accepted that the oppressor the survival of the fittest was the moral being now its the other way around the survival of the ««fittest and white people know they are the oppressor and are immoral and sick creatures styrons book attempted to change this as incredible as it may sound by making the black people the oppressor and the white crackers those gentle benevolent landowners whose sole purpose in life was to liberate darkies the liberator this is why one black critic complains that in styrons propaganda piece nat turners rebellion is depicted as a worse crime than slavery ten black writers respond p  styron didnt get that pulitzer prize for nothing styrons novel is an example of a sick literature and i mean the term sick in the most technical sense freud and normal o brown talk about mentally disturbed people as being at odds with their past either they deny it or accept it to be something it is not marse styron still thinks this is year  dumb cracker and furthermore there is a great tendency to escape something imminent in the present styron says his book was not meant to comment on the black revolt of today while at the same time white reviews are using it as an argument against h rap brown and stokely carmichael in its attempt to escape the present to separate politics from art the past from the present history from existence in  its attempt to fragmentize rather than unify styrons novel is sick literatureie propaganda art unifies it connects the past with the present sociology with psychology politics with art this is what leroi jones means when he says aesthetics and ethics are one but cracker willie styron cant say this because he doesnt want to see the relationship between the past and the present to do so would be admitting openly that marse w styron is an immoral racist oppressor etc and thats too close to home sick literature and propaganda fragmentize true art unifies black writing leroi jones represents a new school of writing and critical thought that is the exact opposite of that of william styron the principle that aesthetics and ethics are one is the foundation for this new school black writers and critics are the only people who can possibly launch this new literature the only people for whom it has meaning as they are the only people who will benefit from emphasizing the oneness harmony and integrity between the present and the past between what is said and what is done between history and fact between literature and for example eating habits the oppressor is always an immoral being people liberating themselves are the only moral people when facts history and sociological statistics oppress they become not fact but fiction not history but fantasy not statistic but alchemy a people liberating itself justifies all only a healthy and moral people can breathe life into letters literature is alive only when it can move freely between the past and present without the anxiety of stumbling on certain facts like america murders  million people a literature is alive and free and beautiful and hence useful only when it is not guiltridden white literature is guiltridden and at odds with its past witness styron and needs to be psychoanalyzed hence alas norman mailer black writers need not attempt to salvage a sick white literary tradition that refuses to see black existence that refuses to give meaningful space to black bodies no we black writers have a responsibility to our people the styrontype you can hurry up and believe has his responsibility to his our responsibility is to expose the moral vacuousness of the white viper nat called him the serpent reveal to our people his immoral system and to prepare our people for the day when his sickness finally engulfs him
the middle of the  night mr stewart duff lay sleepless and in the most melancholy mood he reached for the lamp beside his bed he missed it and reached for it again this time he knocked it to the floor he grunted jumped from his bed and angrily flipped the light on now that he could see it and put it securely in the middle of the table he gave a gloriously resonant belch and sat down on the side of the bed his grandnephew slept in the next room in the deep quiet mr duff could hear the boy snoring unperturbed by the noise of the falling lamp mr duff wished he could sleep so soundly but he was feeling poorly again and how could he sleep when he could not lie down to rest he didnt know exactly what was wrong but he did know that he was ill he felt a cloud of dizziness and he again belched loudly during the afternoon mr duff had dined with his old friend mr alton the two of them had not seen each other for many many years mr alton had left the town when they were both hardly more than boys and the years had danced away leaving them old and heavy of feet and heart mr alton had lost his wife to the same death that stole his only son in war he moved back to his hometown and took a room at a boarding house a yellow building which seemed forever in a state of awkward peeling like an old piece of documentation parchment the encounter between the longparted friends was teary mr duff cried very easily mr alton wheezed a great deal and kept smiling he left most of his food untouched mr duff ate heartily sometimes through crystaline tear drops which were almost silverlike in the brash gleam of the lights mr duff was happy to receive a dinner invitation seldom had he gone anywhere lately for his contemporaries in the town were either moved away or living on the fringes of the lives of their children or grandchildren mr duff had a highly developed sense of self it was always there beneath the marks of time behind the wrinkles which cut gashlike into his face behind the eyes discolored by years of useage and it was present also in the manner of walking when he was strolling alone he could become brisker and more supple than younger men he knew still he liked to know that he was thought about emershed thus within himself mr duff had not contended with the possibility that people might be  weary of listening to a man who had outlived all of his friends and most of his relatives many of whom had been possessed of such great charity that they had stood beneath the girdings of the community like pillars as bulwarks in spirit and in gesture and that he now was decrying his fate into the sympathies and the cool ears of the most recent generations he could hardly know that younger people measured the possibility of their duration on this earth by his old age and wondered if they could attain it and by what fatedefying methods nor could he know that people little younger than himself felt humanly insidious and with the most vulgar and the grossest of superstition that mr duff was living on their time he was for them a stopwatch something to measure an unerring time by and therefore he was a symbol of life and a heralder of death mr alton had asked about his wife but he changed the subject when he realized that mr duff didnt wish to discuss it besides he had not known her but the landlady informed him later that the woman had left mr duff and moved in with her children in new orleans she had an unaccountable disease it was said mrs edwards added under her breath and in a sniffling voice im sure it was her heart anybodyd have a bad heart living with that selfish monster acts like he got some option on life aint nobody else got never been well a day in his life aint never been known to ask nobody else how theyre feeling though naw sir dont nobody visits him cause folks tired o being treated like they doctors and he got people here too in town but they dont go see him either last christmas i did go there to take him a basket when i heard he was real ill when i got there he was carving little animals out of wood but he wouldnt let himself be well for once before i left he had given me a complete goover of his sickness the next day he come by this way big as life i closed the shades real tight today was the first i seen of him since i got to live too you know everybody got to live for themselves mr alton was remembering mr duff as a boy but there were too many blurring images and too great an overlapping of memories his heart could not define and carry the impact of it he concentrated on the present and found himself thanking mrs edwards for a very good dinner then he excused himself and went down the hallway to his little room he took out his pocket watch to see what time it was it had grown dark and he contented himself to sit by the window and rest dusk had fallen when mr alton awoke from the restful sleep which had overcome him he startled himself upright but it had grown chilly in the huge drafty room and his limbs ached his left leg had fallen asleep and when he stomped it lightly on the floor to start the blood circulating again a million icy pinpoints sprang into it and he fell into the chair to cry out from the discomforture he sat still and waited finally he could stand without the unpleasant edginess he prepared himself for bed and when his tired head touched the oldfashioned high pillows he was already snoring and dead to every sound of the house the town and the world at six oclock paul mr duffs grandnephew woke up for the last time that morning he had tossed for most of the long night and he was gruff in spirit angry with his uncle for having kept him awake with his insomnia several times he wished to call his uncle and find out what was bothering him but he decided against it his uncle would surely seize the opportunity to begin his customary enumeration of all his real and imagined illnesses and sleep would be impossible after listening to him the house was quiet now paul bathed and dressed he ate a jam sandwich and drank some milk he was in a hurry recently he had gotten a job at a supermarketthe largest in the townas a stock boy he was the first and only black boy there and he wanted to do the most commendable work possible someday another boy who needed the job as much as he had needed it might find it to his liking it was a long enough thought for a  yearold boy he had wished to say im gone to his uncle but he was afraid to after last night he knew that it would be more difficult than ever to get away from him he did like living with his uncle and he did love him but it was becoming hard not to hurt his feelings and he wished he could understand him he thought about the story of the boy and the sheep and how the boy had cried wolf so many times it seemed to him that his uncle was similar to that boy but it made him chuckle to compare his graybeard of an uncle to a little boy and he raced down the road he hoped his uncle would not appear suddenly at the door at the section of town where the streets were paved and bordered with trees and grass paul slowed down and began to walk at an even cool pacemr alton an early riser had begun to drink the last of several cups of coffee brewed so well by mrs edwards he considered telling her how fine it tasted but he remembered her cruel discussion of his old friend duff and he merely nodded when she passed his table on her way back to the kitchen she hadnt known duff when he  was a young man when he was as straight and tall as an oak and when it would have embarrassed him to mention to any other person so much as a mild headache they were both good hunters in those days and fishermen too he remembered that duffs father had owned the finest buggy in the whole county and that he was also the first black man to own an automobile in those days there was no woman who would have closed her shades against the approach of duff unless she was touched in the head he thought he would drop by to see his friend they could reminisce from the strength and glow of those days so very long ago his friend would recall a quiet happiness to take away the bitter encroachment of a helpless old age nearing mr duffs house mr alton could see that the old man had not begun to bestir himself into the new day he rapped at the door and turned to see a woman feeding a stray cat some scraps of meat he knocked again there was no answer he walked around the house listening quietly to hear any waking sound which would mean that his old friend was home he knocked again at the back door and he started to leave a note but there was a light in the room and so he went to the window and tapped it with his walking cane he thought about mrs edwards recounting her visit to duff and her description of his imagin ary illness he wondered if he might indeed be ill but he realized that a grandnephew who lived with duff would be the first to attend to his uncle the old man peered into the window for good measure he could see someone lying in a slumped position but he didnt know if it were duff or the nephew he didnt wish to behave in a silly alarmist fashion he called loudly and he did become alarmed he called to the woman feeding the kitten together they opened the door and propped the old man onto the pillows he was not speaking and his pulse was worse than faint he was a very sick man sister do you own a phone that you might call a doctor without answering the woman streaked from the house moments later mr alton watched his old friend leave for the hospital in an ambulance and curious neighbors come to see the old man down the street found dying in his room all by himself when mr duff awoke in the hospital room much later his nephew paul his brother ernest his niece mattie and mr alton came in to see him he couldnt recall the last time he had seen them all together the visitors explained to him that he had suffered indigestion and a stroke yes he said i was sick all night long i was sick as i could be it sure means something to have somebody care about you dont it now but the visitors were silent and paul stared at his old uncle for a long long time before he left the room his mother followed after him soon the group of relatives were standing on the sidewalk in front of the small town community hospital mr duff in his room alone turned his face toward the cool aqua walls beyond the partition in the middle of the room he thought someone coughed without seeing anyone though he whispered i was sick i was sick all night long sick as i could be
tomorrow i will lose the door on this dream chapter of my life forever i know full well that in doing i will forfeit much true happiness and just possibly my chances for ever again achieving such satisfaction but so it always has been and so it must be life is like this to force a man to choose between that which provides him an admirable public posture and that which gives him personal joy and fulfillment as squire of mount vernon and hero of fort le boeuf already i have achieved more than most accomplished men of my age and station tomorrow taking as my wife martha dandridge custis i shall improve my station fourfold the widow will bring to me some   additional acres of valuable virginia land plus a good  slaves and an elegant town house in williamsburg further she will open to me because of her social connections what remaining avenues there exist to the seat of power in williamsburg at the age of  on my next birthday a month and some days away i shall be a man of considerable wealth and consequence all this is not to be taken lightly and yet it will not be so easy as all that the fanciful pleasures of my career as bachelor squire of mount vernon have been great it will be difficult to abandon them forever i know that i shall spend agonizing nights longing for flora that so aptly named vixen of my terrible desire i shall suffer remembering her soft strong body her taunting laugh even her musk soft yet strong like her body but above allthe maddening dance which she used to fire me to torment me to have her way with me to degrade me    for yes she degraded me time and again she degraded me if it had been possible to hate her i would have destroyed her long ago i would have told louis to use the lash on her i would have put her in the fields broken her spirit with the hardest of work fed her to thor the black stud    instead i permitted her to degrade me she would come to my bed taunting me saying master and saying that with just the most bearable kind of sarcasm saying master if you are good to akar then i will make you happy i will give you pleasure you can know no other place and i bargained with her i the master of mount vernon the master of her very life bargained with her i had only to command her she was mine to do as i bade but i bargained with her in order to enjoy her smiles her caprice i gave in to her i let her degrade me    and yet it was through the dreams of flora that i finally saw deep into my own nature her female cruelty led me to selfdiscovery because of her guile i know now that marrying mrs custis is the best thing for me that will save me the marriage will force upon me the style and pattern of life which will make it forever impossible for me to sink so low as flora brought me    it is strange now to sit here by the fire as the night grows old with the servants long since asleep and the january cold seeping through the sills and to recall the fantasies which have brought me to this moment the winters at wakefield were always terribly cold it seems although i remember so little specifically about them mostly i recall hannibal the slave the huge handyman who was my fathers favorite it seems to me now that it was during the winters that i saw most of him lawrence my halfbrother was always away for he was too old to be of much companionship and so it was hannibal who was assigned to look after me he would put me to bed and then sit watching the fire in the fireplace until i fell asleep sometimes if i awoke in the night he would still be there sitting beside the dying fire i did not realize until much much later that he remained there because sarah his slave woman had been sold he stayed because it was warm in my room the drafty cabin which he shared with a group of male slaves was miserable but i did not realize that he sat in the chair and slept one night i awoke to find him standing beside my bed using my slopjar i watched in fascination i had never seen anything so large but more than that i was shocked at hannibal using the slopjar slaves never used anything that belonged to their masters hannibal had broken that law because he knew that he could not return to my room once he had left the house to go to the outhouse in the slave quarters  i no longer remember what stroke of malice prompted me to tell my father what hannibal had done but i do recall that my father was so angry that he personally took the strap to hannibal i watched in shame and guilt as my father led the giant black man to the stables and there in a space used by the boys who tended the horses as a clearing among the bales of hay made him strip off his shirt and breeches hannibal stood there his great body bare except for a white rag around his private parts his muscles seeming to ripple in the sunlight flowing in the stable door i recall experiencing a quiver of fear my father was not a large man and not especially a strong one but there he stood ordering hannibal to kneel before him i knew that had he possessed the courageor madnessto do so that hannibal could simply have taken my fathers neck in his hands and broken it but there was something else which i felt something more subtle and sinister a feeling whichthanks to godi would not understand for many years to come hannibal knelt and my father proceeded to lash him with all his strength throughout the ordeal the black man never once cried out never even murmured even though great whelps rose across his broad back and shoulders and blood streamed down his body it was winter a short time following that incident when my father died i was  then living at my fathers farm near fredericksburg it was a bleak and terrible time and i was relieved when spring came and i could help supervise the planting and the operation of river farm i did not care much for school but i was very fond of moving through the fields watching the slaves at work and helping mr thornton our overseer to manage the farm i did not like it at all when in  i had to go to live with my brother lawrence at hunting creek i was  then and i already was beginning to have wilder fantasies i was very curious about the sex lives of the slaves and on occasions i would wander down to their quarters late at night and pass quietly among the cabins some of the sounds emanating from the cabins filled me with ambiguous feelings i was both excited and repelled it was particularly outside the cabin of thor the stud slave that i lingered he was quite popular with the women even when it was not a matter of business for the plantation and there always was some woman in his cabin i was intrigued by thor perhaps because in physical aspect he so reminded me of hannibal but he had few other of the attributes of my fathers slave where hannibal was kind and patient thor was cold and arrogant where hannibal was docile and yielding thor was bold and defiant hannibal knew he was a servant thor knew he was a valuable commodity a producer of healthy slave children for the plantation the slave lawrence had given me as my personal servant was a son of thor a boy some five years younger than myself for some reason thor was especially fond of this particular boy who he had named akar after he said his own family back in west africa thor took the boy in hand and taught him athletic tricks taught him hunting and scouting in the woods along the potomac because he was mine he had to do only the minimum of work in the tobacco fields when not in my service he spent most of his time around the stables he learned to ride quite well and i used to take him with me on jaunts across the country and along the potomac by the time he was  he already was as solid and as sturdy as a man of  it was clear that he had inherited the physique and the potency of his father it was in fact during akars fifteenth year  that lawrence died once again death had come to challenge me and to alter my fate i was  now and mount vernon which lawrence had built for his wife anne was mine the responsibility of the huge estate was in my hands and i knew that i had to demonstrate that i could handle it mr thornton was brought over from river farm to act as overseer and i plunged into the task of making mount vernon one of the most prosperous farms in all of virginia but all of this dedication to work did not preclude me from serving in the militia i had been named adjutant and there was plenty of work to do whenever possible i took akar with me for he now served as my valet when robert dinwiddie lt col of virginia selected me to take a contingent of men to ride to presque isle to warn the mischiefmaking french against further advances on crown territory in the ohio valley i arranged to take akar with me we rode off into the woodlands heading north and west of the virginia territory facing not only the treacherous french but also the wild and dangerous indians winter came early that year  it was cold and it snowed heavily before we reached fort le boeuf at one point we became lost in the forest two of our pack mules slid off a ravine and we ended up with virtually no provisions to add to our problems we found ourselves completely surrounded by a band of hostile redskins that was when i thanked god that i had brought akar along the indians descended upon us as we stopped for the evening to set up camp beside a rushing stream before we could reach our muskets they were all among us my men  were panicstricken and it was not from the cold alone that they trembled but akar stepped forward and addressed the indian leader he held out his hands and smiled in some sort of greeting and the indian leader responded with a similar gesture they touched hands then shoulders then touched hands again the indian smiled then turned and said something to his own braves many of them pushed forward to touch akars hands and shoulders in the same manner that their leader had done it was clear now that they were not going to harm us they did not pay much notice of the white men there but they did not menace us they came forward and settled around in groups at one point akar said to me that he was going to ask the indians for food but you do not know their language i cautioned him akar only laughed all men of goodwill speak a common language he said they will understand he returned to the indian leader and with gestures indicated that we had lost our mules and our provisions the indian nodded as if he understood then spoke to one of his lieutenants at once a group of the redmen disappeared from the nowglowing fireside in less than an hour a new party of redskins arrived on the scene but what a strange safari there was at least two dozen of them including a bunch of slim young girls holding blankets up to their faces so that only their dark eyes surveyed us they had brought two horses apparently to replace our lost mules and a basket of maize and dried fish but the prize parcel was a freshly killed doe which they proudly dumped at akars feet while the militiamen set about skinning the animal and preparing it for cooking over the open fire a curious event took place a dozen or more yards away from the fire the braves began erecting a wigwam i had assumed that akar somehow had communicated to the indian leader that i was both his master and the leader of the militiamen but that appeared at once not to be the case the indians did not at any time pay the slightest attention to me or to the other white men akar was the center of all their attention when the food was ready they urged akar to eat well which he did having a fullsome and healthy appetite finally the indian leader bade akar follow him over to the little tent which had been set up akar stood in the doorway and laughed with delight then he entered the tent alone almost at once i heard girlish giggles emanate from the tent and then i realized that none of the young girls was standing about they were all inside the tent with akar the militiamen were both astounded and annoyed why do they favor that black boy of yours one of them demanded with great surliness what do they see so wonderful in him the others chorused their agreement if i may say so major one of them dared to begin that young buck of a black needs to know his place i got up from my place and wandered in the direction of the tent i was in the throes of an unobtainable excitement the sounds coming from inside the tent thrilled and tormented me i could distinguish akars sighs his heavy breathing and now and then an indian maiden cried out in commingled pain and joy i paced around the tent oblivious of the indians and of my own men i wanted to thrust aside the tent and to look upon the scene a wildness possessed me on an impulse i moved toward the tents entrance but the indian leader stepped forward and barred my way the face that had smiled at akar now glared at me but i am his master i shouted i am commander here and that boy is my slave for an interminable moment the indian stared into my face he said nothing at all at length he merely shook his head that was enough one glance around us showed me that the braves were alert for action there was nothing to do but to return to the fireside and wait when finally i drifted off to sleep in my blankets the revelry in the tent was going full score several other of the militiamen already  were asleep but all the indians remained awake silent watchful solemn at dawn when we all awakened there were no indians there was no wigwam and there was no akar we searched and shouted for the slave but there was no sign of him either he had run away with the indians or else they had forced him to accompany them for me it was easier to believe the latter i could not image that akar would ever voluntarily run away from me i had always been a kindly master to him as we rode off toward presque isle it was clear that the militiamen resented me for my leniency with akar it was an affront to them that the slave had run off they had secretly looked forward to abusing him for what had happened during the night i knew that they wanted to teach him a lesson and he had foiled them but the great loss was mine i had become dependent in many ways upon akar and i already missed him i kept telling myself that he would follow behind us after he had satiated himself with pleasure with the squaws i was not prepared to accept anything else the hazards of the journey deflected my thoughts from my prodigal slave and when we encountered the french we found them impertinent and defiant nevertheless we delivered his majestys warnings to them against their incursions into crown territory and then we set out for the return journey to williamsburg when we  reached the country where akar had vanished we found no trace of any human beings although i forced the militiamen to scour the area and we made camp at precisely the same place where we had met the friendly braves after two days there with the militiamen constantly grumbling we embarked on the final leg of our journey when we arrived back at williamsburg we had been gone for more than  weeks back at mount vernon i prepared my report of the journey which was published as the journal of major george washington in the report i made it quite clear that the french were recalcitrant and that further difficulties could be expected from them in the ohio valley the report was very favorably received by lt gov dinwiddie who immediately decided that i would have to lead a force of volunteers into the territory to challenge the french the following april was set at the time of my leaving virginia but in the meantime another slave emerged to trouble my life    i had contracted a rather bad cold during the journey west and so it was necessary upon my return that i have rest and medication dr james rode in to see me several times and i was put in the care of annes maid lucybelle it so happens that a few days later lucybelle fell on the stairs and wrenched her ankle as a result her young daughter was sent up from the quarters to fetch and carry for me i suppose i had seen the child beforecertainly i had for lucybelle had brought her to the big house on many occasionsbut not in recent years and so her appearance came as a decided shock she was in the very bloom of her years her young breasts were full her body firm and astonishingly mature her small head regal her face at once innocent and alluring was i feverish could i george washington squire of mount vernon master of many slaves promising officer of the kings servicecould i be excited by a mere black servant girl my slave or was i afflicted with the incurable disease of fantasy it was too ridiculous to consider seriously i merely regarded the girl accepted her ministrations gave her instructions and tried to relax and read there was much to do before the april excursion many reports to scan much planning to do learning of a few key french words in order to communicate with the foreign forces around presque isle    still the girl was there alive looking down at me serving the broth changing the linen her reality was undeniableas undeniable as her extraordinary beauty now it is common of course for slaveowners to take their pleasure among their slaves and i am rare for not having done so the officers at fredericksburg made great sport of me thinking that i spend hours cavorting in the hay with the comely slaves after all i am a bachelor i am without responsibilities to a wife or to a fiancee why then do i not have little halfwhite pickaninnies trailing about the quarters those mulattoes who are on the premises are the issue of the overseers and it is whispered of lawrence but i have abstained but now everytime she is near me my body fires i feel a restlessness which is different in aspect from that excitement which comes to me when i go to the quarters and listen outside the cabins or when i see the great muscular body of thor arched over one of the yielding women what is this difference one morning as she turned to go i called to her flora i said come here come to me she came shyly standing silent her brown hands folded before her where is lucybelle i asked how is she doing lucybelle mending well sir she cannot yet come up the stairs is there anyone else in the house now no sir they are all working in the fields and at the stables the cook is in the smokehouse i regarded her well experiencing an unfamiliar delight in her quiet submissiveness i was emboldened where have you been that i have not seen you girl working in the fields sir and at night what do you do at night she did not hesitate or blush which was good we sing and pray sir then it is time to sleep we must rise before dawn sir and your man   who is your man have you been bedded by thor she stepped back affronted sir i have no man i am but  now lucybelle keeps thor away    so thor has been after you    sir thor is after every woman it is his work sir i laughed at that indeed it was so it was thors work work which he dearly loved you are a virgin then i said with some disbelief it was difficult to imagine such a prize being untouched the girl was not embarrassed lucybelle keeps me so sir yes lucybelle would i thought lucybelle ruled the big house and it was not surprising that she tried to rule the quarters as well she was as straitlaced and puritannical as any williamsburg matron suddenly on impulse i said take off your clothes girl i want to have a close look at your body without protest she obeyed stripping bare standing before me like some yoruba queen i felt both fear and excitement i wanted to reach out but my arms would not rise i wanted to seize her and to thrust her beneath me in the bed but my manhood failed me her presence overwhelmed me rendered me impotent was it real was i dreaming what shall i do now sir she asked i could not speak for a moment only stare and then i turned away in shame put your clothes on i said then return to your duties when she had dressed and was about to leave i said you must not mention this to anyone especially not to lucybelle if you do you will be thrashed yes sir she answered then softly left the room after she had gone the soft sweet musk of her remained exciting me anew i turned restlessly in bed experiencing now all the hard forcefulness which had failed me when she stood before me i got out of bed and went to the washstand to douse my face and head with cold water i was in terrible misery even after lucybelle was well again i kept flora on in the house but there was not much chance to see her i spent most of my time now preparing for the second journey west and in april i took a force of volunteers back over my former trail i was lt col washington now an authority on the growing threat of french intervention into the colonies as fate would have it things went badly on the second journey and i was glad when after many weeks we straggled back to williamsburg the experience had proven humiliating compared to the first journey and i tried to forget it by concentrating on the farm there was much planning and surveying to do and this kept me busy there was not even much time to spend thinking about flora although she was always about the house watching me with her shy dark eyes she had never understood the little scene in my bedroom that morning then about a year later some militiamen arrived on the premises with a most surprising commodity they had gone out to round up a group of marauding indians and had found akar among them the slave had been captured and over the protest of the chief had been brought back to fredericksburg i was in my study when they arrived so i went down to the yard to greet them akar standing with his hands tied behind him was the perfect picture of the noble savage he wore only the leather breechcloth which the indians affected in the summer and his great apollonian body as ideally constructed as a statue glistened in the sunlight he hung his head he did not even look up when i approached when the militiamen had gone i decided to personally take akar back to the stables and punish him in any case mr thornton was out in the fields and could not do the job i took down the strap and stood facing akar he looked directly at me for the first time it was a strange new looka look of mixed mirth and defiance why did you run away i asked him to be free he replied but i was good to you i gave you everything a slave could want you did not give me freedom dont be impertinent you are a slave i own you that is why i ran away i slashed him with the strap he did not quiver i slashed him again harder he only looked at me with that strange new look get down on your knees i commanded akar sank to his knees but his eyes never left my face i did not like facing him so i stepped behind him and delivered two dozen fierce lashes upon his back when that was done i bade him stand then i untied his hands you will work in the fields now i said i will tell mr thornton to give you the hardest work in the fields and i will order him to shoot you down like a dog if you try to run away he only looked at me go now i said go to the quarters and wash your sweaty body he turned and stalked from the stable as regal as an oba i returned to my study but i could not concentrate on the business at hand i was filled with the excitement i had not known now for many months i tore off my clothes and went to my bedroom to lie down as i turned from my window i saw flora crossing the yard from the quarter it was then that like a flash i conceived the idea which set me off on the path to selfdiscovery    i threw a silk robe around me and went out into the hallway at the top of the stairs i called out to lucybelle send flora up here at once making my voice as stern as possible then i returned to my bedroom closed the door behind me and waited at her light tapping on my door i bellowed out for her to enter which she did apprehensively i ordered her to disrobe charged as i was with a dark surging force she obeyed me without qualm come to me i said standing before me her eyes lowered she was the very essence of purity i reached out and stroked her breasts let my hand wander down her molded midriff    she trembled i went to the windows and closed the blinds    that scene was to be repeated time after time so often in fact that i began to neglect the farms i found some excuse to return to the manse during the late morning or before tea time in the afternoon i declined invitations from fredericksburg after awhile i knew that the gentlemen in town were discussing my exploits with approval and that many of them envied me my freedom to expend my energies as i chose still there also was some disapproval after all it was my duty as squire and officer and master of mount vernon to take a bride and to enter legitimately into the social life of the county and in fact i did undertake to pay court to two or three of the eligible young ladies of the region however it was difficult to invest in these relationships anything other than courtesy always it was of the pleasures of my own establishment that i thought still it was possible to own a slaves body and time without owning any part of her that really made a difference to her in time i noted a marked change in flora rather than coming to me in meekness she appeared with a certain reluctance when i commanded her she responded with subdued laughter one morning as i sat on the edge of the bed she suddenly broke into a charming dance circling and undulating about the center of the room when the dance was over she swept up her clothes and ran from the room without my permission as she fled down the stairs i could hear lucybelle shrieking at her berating her what had come over flora what was the reason for her defiance i might have guessed the cause    louis thornton spoke to me one evening as we went over the accounts colonel sir i think you ought to know that the slaves are laughing at you down in the quarters that buck akar    akar that night after supper i had akar brought up to the yard i had not come facetoface with him since the day i lashed him some two years earlier and he had changed he was  now fully grown as powerful as his father thor but more handsome but the greatest change was in the way he looked at me he hated me profoundly it frightened me that someone whom i always thought loved and revered me could despise me so completely but i was master he belonged to me i could do with him as i liked no matter what he thought or how he felt i am going to sell you i told him you have shown that you do not appreciate kindness get your belongings together in the morning mr thornton will take you to the auction at fredericksburg without a word he turned on his heels and marched across the yard back to the quarters s j v it seemed to me that i had just fallen asleep after hours of tossing about when i heard the voice in my room colonel sir please  i sat up in bed straining to see in the darkness whos there flora sir the voice said then i saw her standing beside the bed why are you here what do you want i demanded  please sir i have come to ask a favor of you   a favor yes sir you are going to sell akar sir would you sell me with him will you sell us as a pair fury mounted in me how dare you girl i shouted get out of here at once i will not sell you you will stay here as long as i wish you to she was silent a moment then she said if akar goes i will kill myself i will not live without him i will do what you wish as long as akar is here but i will die if he is sent away i promise you sir with that she moved away and i heard the door close behind her when morning came i gave no orders to louis thornton i mounted a horse and rode off to inspect the farms along the potomac flora and akar had won and so life went on in this way for several years but at  i knew that it was past time to alter the pattern it was time to become in fact the eminent and respectable squire of mount vernon the gentleman farmer it helped when flora came to me beaming with joy and announced that she was going to bear akars child tomorrow i will have put all that behind me it has been a dream a fantasy it did not happen at all sitting here on this winter night i have imagined it all yes it was a dream a dream that has ended before it became a nightmare
the word came late to the local black artists columbia college a chicago communications school was calling a national conference on arts and the inner city bringing in nonwhite artists social workers and activists from all across in his initial press reby a washington d c firm called j richard taft associates columbia college president mirron alexandroff was quoted as stating the following most of the arts programs in ghetto communities have little relevance to the people living in the communities the programs generally the nation lease handled  don t involve them dont reach them and frequently dont even entertain them now for the first time the voices of the inner city will have a forum artists sculptors musicians directors and writers from harlem to watts can tell the establishmen and share with each other their success and failure techniques in the same release names of some of the invited guests were listed novelist john o killens director robert macbeth new lafayette theater in harlem author piri thomas luis valdez director el teatro campesino of del ray california colin carew director the new thing in washington d c and james sherman of the watts writers workshop the release listed the following questions to which the conferees would address themselves what standards for the arts in the inner city whose how can people of the inner city be given opportunity to develop their own art how can engagement with the arts either as participant or audience help individuals to selfesteem to constructive insight into self and society how can the arts bring people into meaningful group and community association can the arts have a conscious constructive relationship to social action when the black chicago artists learned of the projected conference and its programindirectly through contacts in tennessee and new york they were furious they hurriedly got together under the umbrella of the coalition of black revolutionary artists cobra and planned a course of action their fury was based on two main points  that a white institution would presume to mount a conference dealing with the artistic needs and direction of black people and  that this would be done without any prior consultation with black artists already living and working in the local community for at least one organization in the black community the columbia college conference was particularly grating members of the organizaion of black american culture obac complained that the conference platform sounded as if it had been lifted straight out of the obac statement of purposes a member of obac contacted john o killens in nashville and told him of the feelings of the local black artists when mr killens arrived in chicago on the eve of the conference he called together in his hotel room the other guests of columbia college and told them of the local black artists reaction to the conference the visitors agreed to go along with the local black artists on whatever course of action was decided when the conference opened officially the following day the representatives of cobra were on hand and as the groups serpentine namesake might have done the spokesmen struck the conference a mortal blow taking the floor jeff donaldson denounced the conference as immoral and illegal and pronounced it terminated the visitors joined the local black artists in a black caucus called to draw up a resolution formally ending the conference and the white conferees headed by columbia college teacher harry bouras withdrew to a white caucus to formulate a resolution of their own for tactical reasons the dissenting blacks agreed to allow the conference to proceed with its planned dinner the following night there were two reasons for this  the occasion would be perfect for presentation of the resolution from the black caucus and  there would be an opportunity to confront dr deton j brooks the black head of the chicago committee on urban opportunity who hadat least partiallyunderwritten the conference in the first place dr brooks was principal speaker at the dinner as a gesture of solidarity among the nonwhites mexican luis valdez was selected to read the resolution from the black caucus here it is western culture can no longer dominate the lives of all men through the devices of racism colonialism and exploitation the reemerging cultures of the third world will define the reality of the future black brown mexican puerto rican and other colonialized people in their communities must decide what art is for themselves therefore the conference which was called arts and the inner city and sponsored by columbia college of chicago had to fail and all other conferences of that nature must fail black brown mexican puerto rican and other colonialized artists will refuse to participate in this kind of exploitation of themselves and their people we support entirely the position of the coalition of black revolutionary artists of chicago which states that black communities must define and control their own culture we contend that only through this kind of definition and control can we achieve human dignity selfrealization and the liberation of our peoples throughout the world it was a historic event for the first time in a formal situation artists from the nonwhite world had served notice that they no longer would submit to the arrogance and presumption of white people in setting standards and judging the legitimacy and validity of their art the repercussions already have been broad and it can be expected that in other parts of the country and the world similar confrontations will take place behind the scenes something equally important was being learned the oldtime hatinhand whiteisalwaysright black leader discovered that his time was over his day in eclipse and that he would have to from now on deal with the angry and militant blacks who are his nemesis also the political powers behind the handkerchief head began to understand even in chicago that the minds of black people are not always for sale the confrontation in chicago was indeed a historical event
it is the new thing institutions of higher learning which formerly recognized black people only as creatures to be studied in sociology classes now are reaching out with fivefigure checks and assorted proposals designed to lure black scholars to the faculties and to add black studies to the curricula from yale to the university of florida to stanford to northwestern the gesture is out in the direction of recognizing the reality of black history and culture wondrous is the fallout from the black revolution but revolutions have a way of moving onward and those not  caught in the current often find themselves unable to move at the revolutions pace it makes for difficult communication such was the case when a committee of professors in the humanities at the university of chicago under the leadership of german instructor james bruce brought in a contingent of black artists and intellectuals to discuss the possible introduction of a black studies program actually to be more accurate the professors were interested in advice on relevant courses to offer black students in black history and culture it was to have been an all evening conference but for all practical purposes the meeting might have been adjourned after the first half hour playwright leroi jones invited from new jersey as consultant saw to that mr jones gave up the social amenities in matters of black and white some time ago and it was fully in keeping with his style that he got directly to the point you have invited black people here this evening to pick their brains mr jones said in effect but we are not going to let you do that mr jones made it clear that he understood that the professors wanted the black guests to show them the way but he also pointed out that the new way made it necessary that black people do their own thing if the university of chicago is seriously interested in exploring black art history and culture mr jones said then the university must give the money to the black community where organizations and institutions concerned with black art history and culture already are in existence mr jones then referred the professors to the other black consultants at the meeting gerald mcworter a founder of the organization of black american culture obac jeff donaldson representative of the coalition of black revolutionary artists cobra lerone bennett jr ebony senior editor and author of popular books on black history and culture poet don l lee author of two published volumes phil cohran musician and composer leader of the artistic heritage ensemble and founder of the affroarts theater margaret burroughs cofounder of the museum of africanamerican history and art and author artist and teacher curtis ellis bookman and hoyt w fuller negro digest editor there was little else to say the professors had not assembled to hear such a revolutionary proposal and saul bellow the eminent author of herzog and other works was the first to take up his pen and walk most of the other professors remained in a state of shock and puzzlement for another hour or so but the conference for all practical purposes had ended with mr jones introductory remarks one or two of the professors indicated that they would indeed rethink their approach to the whole question of the university and its relationship to the black community which surrounds it and one or two said they thought it a good idea to take mr jones proposal to the university administration there were a few moments of desultory and anticlimactic conversation all around then everybody went back again to doing his thing 
in recent years it has been increasingly popular for white critics to play down richard wrights contributions to the world not western world of literature indeed these would be critics have literally established their names on firewords thrown at the father of black literature wrights writings have been called everything from comicstrip dogmatization to nonliterature and that in essence is one of the short comings of this biography richard wright by constance webb putnam  miss webb doesnt remotely try to enlighten us as to the critical status of wrights work what miss webb does and quite well is give us some personal glimpses of a lifelong friend who happened to be a writer who happened to be richard wright i suggest that newcomers to wright or to the works of wright start with black boy and not this biography miss webb introduces us to wrights family to his early childhood and virtually covers in the first few chapters the same ground as wright did and he in a much better prose form in black boy miss webbs book was very difficult to read and reminded me of a very detailed diary the authors word usage is very uneven and her work is cluttered with incessant quotes of wright in places there is more wright than webb which caused this reader to stop continually and wonder if she had perpetual indigestion it seemed as though every detail regardless of size was painlessly recorded as i understand it miss webb does draw upon a privately printed section of black boy and from wrights diary for the years  and  hopefully this diary will be published in its entirety in the near future her coverage of wrights association with the john reed clubs and his affiliation with the communist party is valuable in that one can see the direction in which wright was going and one can understand the magnetic hold the party had on him and other black writers which in wrights case was not as deeply rooted as we were led to believe by the mass media and comicbooks wrights associations with marion perkins the black chicago sculptor jack conroy and nelson algren are mentioned but not elaborated upon his friendship with ralph ellison and horace cayton is enlightening yet limited and miss webb does harm to herself as a biographer and to her book as a biography by only superficially hitting on wrights relationship with gertrude stein chester himes langston hughes and of course james baldwin baldwin devotes a number of important essays to his father and one had hoped that this kinship could have been positively dealt with in such a biography wright after fameuncle toms children  native son  black boy  a split with the communist party also recorded in the god that failed the failure of his first marriage and the union in a second marriage with ellen poplar and his reaction to the racial climate in the united statesdecided to take up residence in paris france in paris wright was honored and given the attention that he felt was due him as a writer not a negro writing about black people jeanpaul sartre and gertrude stein introduced him to the various literary circles and for the first few years he was widely interviewed and quoted in the parisian press from his paris base wright began to travel and write nonfiction and social criticism on a much greater scale he traveled most of europe and into the interior of africa his excursion into ghana produced a book black_power  which chronicled the african revolution paris did not remain congenial for long wrights writing career did not continue to attract the attention it did in the beginning in fact his next three novels received mixed if not adverse reviews from the press and forced wright to take up other means of support for his family the outsider  was considered by some critics to be the first existentialist novel to be published by an american black or white however wright denied this and pointed to his earlier work native son as an example of his first existentialist writings savage holiday and the long dream were immediate failures and enabled the critics to accuse wright of being out of touch with the racial situation in this country as if it had radically changed since wrights departure the reality is that wright never was really out of touch he consistently criticized and hammered at the hypocrisy of the american way due to his unpopular insistence of truth wright acquired many enemies in high places wrights problem was that he never really ceased being a native son and in the final analysis a very unhappy one during his travels wright attracted an amoebic infection and along with his financial and racial problems his health began to fail he was taken by a fatal heart attack in  the father was  miss webb i feel failed as a biographer her book in no way can be considered complete her friendship with wright and his family undoubtedly clouded her writing and vision her objectivity if there is such an animal was subordinated and punctured by the authors personal point of view she incessantly quotes wright presents lively conversations and is forever introducing us to new and exciting people but throughout all this communication of the mans relationships the biographer gives us no real interpretation of them or of his work she doesnt under or overestimate wrights creative power and she virtually leaves the reader in a state of wonderment the definitive biography of richard wright has not been written and it may take a native son to write it miss webbs book was the authorized biography and one can only hope that the information that was accessible to miss webb will be extended to others who may seek to explore the man the photography was a joy and i found the bibliography quite helpful to read the actual works of richard wright is to read the only complete biography of the man and i feel at this time we would do ourselves justice by doing this first from uncle toms children to lawd today from paris to the south side of chicago we are assured that he richard wright was always a native son in prose or in his use of the hokku haiku i am nobody a red sinking autumn sun took my name away don l lee
