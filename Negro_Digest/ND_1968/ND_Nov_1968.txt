brother malcolm and the black revolution
by william keorapetse kgositsile
write this with something bordering on fear among many other things malcolm like nationalism is too many different things to too many people perhaps there would be nothing especially unfortunate and regrettable about that but because of the different levels of our consciousness shaped by the varying degrees of filth and cowardice in us our general understanding of malcolm is therefore necessarily a distortion also running through my mind are the following words of setswana wisdom a motswana doctor throws his bones and when they tell him of an irretrievable loss he will say se ileng se ile se ile mosimeng motlhaelathupa lesilo ke moselatedi loosely translated this says what is gone is goneit has qone down the hole theunreachablebyarodthe irrational ie the unwise and illtempered is hewhofollowsit but then again i realize that malik our monumental spiritual thrust is not gone down any hole if we had been stronger and more intelligent in  malcolm the brother we thought we knew and admired would still have been with us today and today blackman where is rap brown max stanford mandela sobukweamong many other free black men and women you see until we actually stop these racist maniacs who are opposed to any world order that challenges their decadence and racist perversions they will continue to kill our leaders and any voices which by articulating what is or should be in every black heart become a direct threat to the warped white sensibility and its hideous creations but to stop the madness of these perverts we have to move to positions of power before we can move to positions of power we have to know ourselves so that we can among many other necessary things identify the enemy with a very precise clarity this necessarily involves formulating a revolutionary ideology which will facilitate the building of our selfreliant communities and our veritable social institutions which is where malcolm was at which is why malcolm was murdered but let us look beneath the sore to talk of a revolutionary ideology is to talk about the spirit of a people and malcolm as i have said was our spiritual thrust many people who have written about malcolm have overlooked deliberatelv or unwittingly the importance of his inner landscape his spirit but leroi jones not surprisingly he has been talking about the supremacy of the spirit for the past few years could not overlook such an important aspect of malcotms energy malik was the surse at one point and his relationship to the nation of islam is as graphic a picture of world spirit as exists and his break into a secular political intelligence understanding his murder rendered most of the things directly associated with him into ruin his finally was an abstract energy a symbolizing of certain times of certain spirit he was murdered because he summed up the whole blackwhite struggle in america and the world too easily he has risen in a wide arccircle  to embrace a whole public consciousness he was pimpprisoner studentmonk firebrandwiseman and martyr in each place his spirit settled something was turned on and over a beginning an ending jones is talking about what did not die what cannot die which is what we must understand blood to blood we are talking about things deeper than the eye malcolm the mover and the moved the authentic lover fire and love malik the pledge of fire of song the most powerful forces on malcolms inner landscape informed his movement the practical manifestations of his abstract energy which jones talked about fire and love those two forces in the inner landscape are a spiritual measure a way of enabling us to know that we can if we are willing and determined but for us to know if we can actually we must see the promise the hope in us or around us that what we are striving for is  w actually possible and know that after that point there can be no turning back malcolm knew he could that we can malcolm was willing and determined malcolm underwent the internal revolution and internalized the black revolution the world revolution brother malcolm was our dream our promise our hope a concrete vector of our desire and possibility the actual embodiment of what wc strive to beintrepid righteous dedicated to the destruction of evil dedicated to the rebuilding of man and our possi bilities as only the sincere lover can be constantly moving to know you love to know you are loved this is supreme this was and will always be the godly power in malcolm his energy spiritual malcolm was our sun our son when we know we love words of love become acts of love recreating the powerful gods in us making us our moment the supreme rhythmthat is the pulse of the most desirable forces in our sensibility which is spiritual we belong to our time we belong to each other through our journey to and in the breath we seek a spiritual cleanliness informing our vision to keep on pushing relentlessly to reshape the world in the image of this vision fire and love greater than our weaknesses or shortcomings past reason or reasonableness create a force relentlessly demanding a complete union with the soul an abstract energy a symbolizing of certain times of certain spirit gwendolyn midlo hall says in st malcolm and the black revolution negro digest november  spirituality is a powerful highly contagious emotion and in my view mankinds most profound emotion a revolution in the psyche of one man can become an allpowerful force for social change st malcolm was such a man we can now look at the festering sore the tragedy of our dream deferred malcolm our dream died unprotected i have said before see is the black revolutionist a phony in negro digest july  brother malcolm was assassinated at the beginning of his revolutionary maturity because of our collective weakness countless other perverted atrocities are continually perpetrated on us because of our collective weakness brothers what i am driving at is for instance that if our historical enemy now practically our natural enemyknew that should anything have happened to brother malcolm there would be chaos in harlem that night that the following day there wouldnt be a single white store on th street that the very foundations of this system would have to cope with a black uncontrollable power the chances are that brother malcolm would still have been with us i have since realized that one of the major reasons malcolm died unprotected is that many of us who were supposed to did not actually know precisely who we were there is nothing unusual in this filthy world when a very concrete revolutionary man like malcolm is killed by the enemies and oppressors of black people in fact these sinister neoeuropean devils be they in africa asia south or north america have shown us in very exact terms what they are prepared to do to any people who are determined to control their own destiny if they cannot buy you off or scare you or turn you into some freak apologist of their hideous schemes then they organize to isolate and immobilize you or they will kill you we are familiar with what they have done to nkrumah sukarno robert williams mandela sobukwe agostinho neto they even killed luthuli and martin_luther_king who preached a peaceful alternative an appeal based on a level of morality the western whiteman is too beastly to deal with for his own salvation leroi jones has pointed out that the western whiteman cannot even feel because if he could he would feel the pain he is to the majority of the peoples on this planet at the time i am writing this piece these sinister maniacs are carrying out plans to either kill or immobilize every black man they consider a threat to american domestic colonialism and dollarism around the world what they are trying to do to huey newton rap brown eldridge cleaver leroi jones stokely carmichael to name a few is exactly what the french tried to do to the leadership of the algerian liberation front it has happened in all colonial countries i was in detroit recently and there were these devils on tv discussing how they were going to improve their methods of controlling us finally one of them gave the police commissioner orders to arrest brothers glanton dowdell and general baker as soon as any racial incidents broke out i suspect that not knowing precisely who we are we have not always been able to understand what we are up against very clearly the blackwhite relationships and struggle in this country as well as in africa the position of afroamericans in america is that of a colonized people there are three types of colonial situations the first kind is where the colonizers come into the country say as the english did in kenya then they oppress and exploit the people on african soil in the name of some country to which they owe allegiance the second kind of colonial situation is where the settler takes over the country as in south africa or zimbabwe break off ties with whatever european country they owed allegiance to and consider themselves african the amerindians also suffer this kind of colonialism in north america with the third kind european refugee bandits who have usurped a land area like north america oppress and exploit africans they brought over as slaves the conditions of africans under these three kinds of colonialism are the same though the tactics that the colonizer uses on the colonized might vary from place to place which is what malcolm kept hammering at over and over again so that we could better understand who we are in relation to the oppressor pointing out some significant things about the band ung conference malcolm said the same man that was colonizing our people in kenya was colonizing our people in the congo the same one in the congo was colonizing our people in south africa and in southern rhodesia zimbabwe and in burma and in india and in afghanistan and in pakistan they realized all over the world that where the dark man was being oppressed he was being oppressed by the white man where the dark man was being exploited he was being exploited by the white man if we understand this clearly then all the talk about injustice discrimination segregation lack of equality before the law or before any other white institution is just so much sterile crap a trap very carefully worked out by the oppressor to make sure that our minds and feelings remain imprecise as to who we are and what we can actually do but america is doomed as malcolm pointed out with poetic precision so is the rest of the colonial world because we are beginning to be clearer about our roots and identity the gateway to our powerful thrusts into the future with selfrespect malcolm preached a cultural return to africa a strong spiritual bond to guide our goals to guide the formulation of our ideology and the necessary revolutionary tactics and strategies we are beginning to understand who we are historically we are beginning to understand who we are socially our best possible usefulness to our communities we are beginning to understand who we are in our timethe direct relevance of our lives to our strong collective thrusts into the future we are beginning to clearly understand who we are politicallyour direct allegiances and alliances malcolms legacy malcolms purpose and direction malcolms impact on the black revolution the world over nationalism and panafrican unity  these and many more of the practical manifestations of malcolms spirit the outer trimmings jones aptly described themhave been talked about in this magazine and many others so i consider it unnecessarily repetitious to talk about them one thing though i will point out malcolm like nkrumah toure moumie the cameroonian brother who the french poisoned with thallium nyerere fanon ho chi minhto name just a few among our many heroes who have earned our respecttaught us to get rid of our fear and cowardice and wage an uncompromising total struggle like our vietnamese brothers no concessions malcolm warned us because to look forward toand to expect concessions fromthe oppressor is to put yourself in to the trick bag the enemy has until recently been successful in placing us in the nature of this paradox is ridiculous i desire what i do not desire concessions lead you away from revolutionary struggle lessening your chances of liberation revolution is based on land land is the basis of all independence land is the basis of freedom justice and equality brother malcolm taught us because it is on land that a people builds a nation the setswana word for peace is kagisano which literally means building together brother malcolm continued revolution is bloody revolution is hostile revolution knows no compromise revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way look around you today look around the world if you need any evidence to verify the truth and validity of malcolms statements above and always remember this perceptive observation malcolm makes upon looking back at the intelligence of something he did at the age of  all i had done was to improve on their strategy and it was the beginning of a very important lesson in my lifethat anytime you find someone more successful than you are especially when youre both engaged in the same businessyou know theyre doing something that you arent fanon demystified said to put africa in motion to cooperate in its organization in its regrouping behind revolutionary principles to participate in the ordered movement of a continentthis was really the work i had chosen understanding africa there to include african societies wherever they may be that too was malcolms spirit it is reoccurring in many of us today because there are memories between us deeper than grief there are feelings between us much stronger than the cold enemy machine that breaks the back    there are places between us deeper than the ocean no distances the reoccurrence of malcolms spirit is the source of our power the power of the best possible productive uses of our lives the ingredients are simple i have written elsewhere more steps towards our freedom and have always been there within reach selfrespect  you cannot do anything of real human value unless you respect yourself and your family all the brothers and sisters around the world dedication and commitment to reshaping our lives even our literature and the rest of the arts have to be must be committed and committing the undesirable and the meaningless we will destroy belief with clarity unless you believe in possibility possibility is what always moves usunless you believe that you can actually do something you cannot do it and with our memory pried open to the bone of feeling in the stillnesses of the night we see the gaping wounds where those murderers butchered your flesh as they butchered the flesh of our land spirit to spirit we hear you then blood on blood comes the pledge swift as image in spirit and blood the sons and daughters of our beginnings boldly move to postwhite fearlessness their sharpnesses at the murderers throat as salaam alaikum 
black roadblocks to black unity
by dr alvin f poussaint and linda r mc lean
he emergence of the black_power slogan in j june  heralded e a new period in the philosophy of civil_rights organizations since then numerous allblack groups have formed throughout america these groups have sprung up not only in the black community but within previously integrated institutions thus we have black caucuses within religious and political organizations afroamerican societies formed on predominantly white college campuses an afro american teachers association and a black social workers association etc there are also various black economic and business organizations being formed these new groups are mushrooming at such a rapid rate that it is almost impossible to keep track of them or to adequately chronicle their formation this new drive for black unity solidarity represents a profound and significant new dimension of the racial struggle in america the formation of allblack political and social action organizations in the black communities is a relatively new phenomenon because of historical impediments both legal and extralegal which existed and which succeeded in promoting black fragmentation and group weakness for example during slavery blacks were disorganized and weakened as a group through the breakup of families and through the displacement and destruction of african culture and history to maintain control and to keep down rebellions whites forbade slaves from gathering together in significant numbers for meetings although group gatherings for religious worship were sometimes allowed by the slave master blacks were prevented from becoming literate so that they could not read and chronicle their experiences grievances and plans in any organized fashion more important however were the many psychological barriers and scars which prevented black ? organization especially if such organization was met with white disapproval the plantation system in itself implanted a dependency in the minds and behavior of the black man which was inimical to leadership it also prevented blacks from acquiring the skills of administration and control which are  necessary for independence and success that is most of the slaves needsfinancial social and personalwere provided for by the master in this connection not only did the black man not have a chance to gain these skills he also never acquired feelings of competency in running things by himself child psychologists know that an important developmental task for youngsters is to have them do things independently in order to gain confidence in their ability to succeed overprotected children whose parents do everything for them often suffer from a lack of feelings of competency thus they often may not feel capable of undertaking projects on their own in addition slaves had limited opportunities to follow the leadership of other assertive and challenging blacks in a successful enterprise most black leadership as in slave revolts ended in failure which was negatively reinforcing blacks were encouraged to follow docile acceptable and whiteapproved leaders assertive systemchallenging blacks have always been feared by whites the racist elements in our society have systematically eliminated often with violence and murder blacks who were nonacquiescent or considered uppity niggers thus the types of skills necessary to satisfy the needs of ones own group which other ethnic groups acquired were never well developed in the black community and as a result blacks became dependent after slavery there was a void in the experiences of black people as well as psychological distrust of other blacks and their abilities to form successful organizations and to provide leadership black people had learned that white was right white was successful all around them and blacks were subservient for example blacks did not have to establish selfhelp organizations because the white boss provided for them the freedmens bureau like a benevolent father sought to take care of the black mans needs the presentday welfare system perpetuates this dependency blacks did not develop business associations of significance because the primary business among black people was the selling of their labor and the business end of such ventures was run by white men blacks were given their religion their language and their culture in addition since the large businesses corporations and industrial enterprises not only in america but in all of the industrialized western world were run by whites and evaluated as being better than nonindustrialized societies blacks had to feel that whites were more successful and capable in this area this lack of opportunity for black people to exercise control and independence has often left a void in the collective black psyche examples of blacks thirst for authority and leadership can be seen in a variety of work and religious situations slaves were preoccupied with imitating their masters and with giving orders this phenomenon was observed in nazi concentration camps and has been noted among groups which are kept subservient the opening scene in the movie gone with the wind shows a black field hand yelling quittin time immediately another slave says youre not supposed to say quittin time im supposed to say it whereupon he proceeds to call out the order himself as this scene exemplifies such small amounts of power were so important that slaves could seriously fight for a modicum of authority house servants felt superior to field hands because their work was inside where they ran the kitchen they took care of the household and they had responsibility even if it was under supervision in religious groups from slavery times to the present there has been a great deal of emphasis placed on positions offices and authority churches which were the only legitimate black organizations to which slaves could belong had ministers deacons elders ushers and all sorts of petty officers today we can see this emphasis on positions in black groups in fact black social and religious groups are frequently plagued by internal discord petty bickering distrust and jealousies among the membership the formality and organization within some black groups make one think that often more emphasis is placed on form than on function and on rules than on programs therefore in understanding present black organizations two things must be brought to the forefront  black people suffered from a deficit of experiences in organizing running things successfully and exerting power  black people never had much of a chance to follow other black leaders in succesful enterprises rather they saw whites as the successful leaders businessmen and politicians and were always led by them the brief experiences of black men in politics during reconstruction were shortlived and sorely maligned in history afterwards as being corrupt inept ignorant and disastrous consequently although blacks abilities in working cooking and taking care of children were recognized they were never allowed to be in charge today blacks can cook in restaurants but they do not own and run them until recently they could provide entertainment but not own record companies radio stations or have their own television programs they could design clothes shoes hats for someone else but not produce and manufacture them in the old tradition they gave or sold their services but never capitalized on them and organized them for their own gains an awareness of this black experience which historically has overwhelmingly witnessed white leadership is very important when seeking to understand the internal problems which plague black organizations today in previous papers it was suggested that black civil_rights workers blamed the presence of whites for the failure of these groups to accomplish more in terms of programs and change  however after the whites left the problems of group organization and effectiveness remained the types of problems and handicaps which exist in the operations of many allblack groups make it amazing and commendable that so much has been accomplished by them the fact that despite a multitude of handicaps black people have seen the need and expressed the desire to organize testifies to their fortitude perseverence flexibility and determination it is hoped that the documentation of these typical dysfunctional and counterproductive mechanisms will enable such groups to identify and to eliminate barriers to their successful operations some of these phenomena have been identified as disruptive to the smooth functioning of any group these factors can be found in the vast sociological and psychological literature on the formation and functioning of groups and group dynamics other problems appear to be endemic to negro groups we have already mentioned a deficit in organizational and leadership skills which originally handicaps black groups second we have pointed to the lack of successful black leadership models in the past from this tradition has emerged a very serious problem of which many leaders of many black groups are probably aware this is the basic distrust and lack of confidence which many blacks have in black leadership because of projected feelings of selfhatred and inferiority black leaders have often found it difficult to get other black people to follow them it seems as though a lot of black people distrust the intentions and abilities of any black person who tries to lead a group comments such as who does he think he is and he dont know nothin are typically directed towards a potential organizer blacks have seen white success and black failure all of their lives  they thus question the skills as well as the motives of a person trying to lead them they have been betrayed by blacks who have soldout or sold them down the river therefore they often wonder whats in it for him along with the basic distrust are the more serious selfhatred feelings many blacks shudder at having to do with any organization that is allblack black symbolizes inferiority allblack groups signify an imposed forced segregation which blacks have fought against all of their lives some negro leaders can see no good inand will have nothing to do withallblack groups because they see these as further institutionalizing segregation and legitimizing inferiority thus to them anything allblack has to be stigmatized and inferior this question has many ramifications that do not permit adequate discussion here are all black institutions and situations inherently inferior is inferiority or pathology inherent in the fact that a group or institution is allblack or is it a matter of how they got to be allblack most black institutions have arisen out of a forced segregation and oppression and so tend to be inferior if the oppression is lifted it is quite conceivable that an allblack school or community could be of high quality because many blacks may shun anything that is allblack or any group that is led by a black person we see this selfhatred becoming counterproductive to black organizations dynamically a person says black is inferior i hate myself because i am black and therefore inferior this group of allblacks is inferior so i hate it and will not work with it or destroy itthis strong feeling against black leaders and the preference for white leaders is so prevalent that many major black organizations have white men at the heads trustees governing boards etc it is almost ludicrous to think of a black person leading the american jewish congress bnai brith or the united jewish appeal in fact you would not even find a gentile in this position it is ridiculous to think of a caucasian or a black heading the chinese businessmens association or a nonethnic member being president of an irish or italian group however it has been very typical to see whites as leaders and board members of major black organizations there is nothing wrong with having white persons as members of black organizations however there is a big difference between having white members of predominantly black organizations and having whites as leaders and policymakers of these organizations another factor which plagues black organizations once they are establishedalthough this is also a factor that is disruptive when it occurs in any groupis the cathartic needs and domineering attitudes of some of their members anyone who has attended meetings of some black organizations is familiar with the type of person who demonstrates a profound need to speak out to get angry to show how bad and militant he is and who monopolizes the time of  the group by dominating and intimidating other group members this type of behavior probably is prevalent because blacks have had the opportunity to openly and publicly express their anger and hatred towards whites this behavior is often exaggerated by the excessive use of profane language and personal threats which such individuals direct towards other members this may serve an important function in satisfying the personal needs of some group members however often this type of behavior prevents programs from being formed and remedies carried out while these persons may satisfy their own needs to sound off many times they become fixated at this point and cannot move on to more productive behavior since such behavior is destructive to the group it may be a manifestation of selfhatred feelings displaced to the allblack group thus these persons present roadblocks because not only do they take up valuable time they also prevent others from saying or doing anything constructive this type of behavior has interesting psychiatric psychological bases roots the excessive nature of these outbursts and the inappropriate emotions and affect associated with their delivery in part stem from repressed rage and unexpressed anger many of the individuals who are attracted to a group meeting walk around without expressing their anger towards white people and their rage at being oppressed thus when given a safe forum such as the confines of an allblack meeting their release of pentup frustrations is like the bursting of a dam there is another very important phenomenon seen in the behavior of some leaders of black organizations which has a devastating effect on the credibility of these leaders and on their ability to attract a following many of the most militantsounding antiwhite talking young men contradict all they say in action by dating white girls or militant black women date white men it is obvious that the talk of black pride and unity of how black is beautiful and how beautiful it is to be black and of how white people are racists ring hollow when the same person who attempts to influence the populace is seen dating the enemy so to speak this behavior suggests that such a militant is caught up in a reaction formation when he becomes militantly black but he really believes white is right the main problem with this behavior for the effective functioning of black organizations is that it tends to fragment groups and weaken a leaders ability to be convincing the followers see this leader through his actions as being hypocritical dishonest or just messed up therefore he cuts down on his leadership potential still another occurrence which often drastically undercuts the smooth operations of some black organizations involves the tremendous status needs which many members and leaders have the personal desire for individual attention and recognition which many of these individuals demonstrate in their behavior and the tendency to build personality cults rather than strong organizations lead to severe competition discord and antagonism as well as neglect of group goals for example the tremendous needs for personal glory and adulation both within and outside the group which individuals have lead many persons in black organizations to be stubborn obstinate intractible and unyielding in their attitudes opinions and positions they often may refuse to cooperate on group projects to compromise their ideas or positions or to think in terms of what is best for the group or the goals of an organization rather than what will bring selfaggrandizement such needs for status in blacks may stem from basic feelings of worthlessness and inferiority because they are blacks in a white racist society therefore a large proportion of time and energy is expended and wasted fighting personal battles and being preoccupied with petty behavior this very often sabotages the programs of organizations creates personality camps hardens feelings and causes a breakdown in effective programming and operations we have discussed six major problems which typically plague black organizations and which hamper their effective operations in addition to internal factors  however there are external pressures which impede the success of allblack organizations one such external factor is the lack of financial support which is given to black organizations by other blacksespecially the black middle class along with the abhorence of things allblack and the pursuit of things  allwhite goes much of the black middleclass financial support many middleclass blacks will support white charitable organizations financially however few of them will provide financial support to mostlyblack groups such as the black muslims core or even sclc and the naacp the dynamics and motivations involved here are complex although interesting for some blacks the ability to give money to white groups allows them to gain acceptance and to participate and feel like everybody else some blacks do not see allblack groups as worthwhile in addition to support them forces them to recognize that there is a need for a separate black organization and that there may be problems which pertain solely to them as blacks because of racism this may force them to acknowledge that all is not well and that they are not really accepted on the basis of their individual merits and accomplishments this phenomenon of nonsupport is seen even among verbal militants as one black spokesman said there are lots of cats walking around with natural hair and processed minds thus some individuals who advance their black identity verbally and visibly never put their money where their mouths are in the final analysis it has been white money which has provided the major financial support for civil_rights organizations in the program area black organizations many times experience difficulty in defining their problems discreetly and setting realistic goals because of the overwhelming number of problems which black people face in american society and the pervasiveness and interrelatedness of multiple problems it is often difficult to define problems and to set realistic goals a group very often defines its problems too broadly sets out to solve all of the ills of black people in society and consequently ends up entirely frustrated and discouraged instead of deciding for example to tackle the one area such as employment or particular industries which discriminate or to work on educational barriers or particular school problems a group may decide that it wants to end discrimination in jobs housing and education it may decide to gain jobs housing and freedom now this global definition of goals is unpenetrable and therefore frustrating if a group does not isolate a

from julian j tt v mayfields challenge to my bestseller the crisis of the negro intellectual  it is revealed that his feelings have been deeply lashed he speculates with grief that if i had become rich and famous we might have been spared this spiteful book at the beginning of his challenge he asserts that when he picked up my book which began with such promise he had great expectations for reading a work of criticism an area in which we have not yet achieved distinction however after reading it he regrets the painful necessity of having to report that the crisis  is a glaring failure and worse   its good he knows we lack critical distinction in passing to the meat of his challenge he says that the book will be a brisk seller especially on college campuses despite the expensive price  it was at this crucial point that i began to hurt badly because he is misquoting my price which is downright unethical of himimagine cutting into my campus sales like that i am indignant the real price is  which is a way of avoiding saying  and change as a result of this unfair trade practice of misquoting my sellout price to the campus establishment i am in more fiscal pain than is mayfield in critical discomfiture of course mayfield need not have pained himself into his sorrowful decision of putting down my book as an unmitigated failure i would rather he did it with gleeful chuckles inspired by the certain knowledge that he had killed all possible brisk sales off the campuses if not on but alas alack mayfield suspects otherwise painfully and so he wishes the book had never been  written and the issues in the book had never been reused in such a painful way but how does one raise painful issues without pain i commiserate with mayfields politically thin skin criticism on the issues especially those he didnt discuss are indeed a hard school and mr mayfield has not been accustomed to this sort of thing although he and i are products of the same political tradition we came from different sides of the railroad tracks in a manner of speaking unlike myself mayfield never received critical assaults before because he never raised any critical issues while in the communist left i can boast of a long record of raising issues in the communist left and getting raked for it while mayfield and his friends were conforming and performing for their privileges it is these friends of his that he unconsciously refers to when he wishes that we might have been spared my spiteful book also negro digest readers should not believe that mayfield really expected anything from my book but what he got he knew what to expect because its a cinch he had already been told our mutual animosity and divergence of views had been established as far back as   and  in  an article on the communist left which i published in the studies on the left inspired mayfield to write john henrik clarke a letter containing the statement that cruse ought to be lynched at least that was the way clarke relayed it to me verbally mind you there was nothing about mayfields personal commitments mentioned in that article still from way over there in ghana mayfield bristled like an angry rooster in the red barnyard yet when it comes to a discussion  of the issues raised in my bestseller he acts like an intellectual chicken hiding his thin skin behind a cackling barrage of barnyard gossip but this has always been characteristic of the colored section of the communist left which included a dull collection of intellectual yesmen yeahwomen yea sayers and trained apologists for communist party irrelevancies on black reality nothing unsettled them and made them bristle selfrighteously more than a threat of criticism all through my communist career and even after all that i ever got from the likes of richard b moore hope stevens lorraine hansberry and her freedom newspaper circle and other lesser bureaucrats of negro marxiana was the intolerance and exclusiveness of cliques the arrogance of a privileged caste the closedminded rigidity of a bureaucracy whose status was predicated not on anything politically creative but on a hackneyed political line dating back to the s these are the we for whose feelings mayfield is hurting ever since mayfield first arrived belatedly in  he has tried mightily for the role of a frontrunner like one very ambitious to star in the eyes of his more experienced colleagues that he was the first to answer my book with a written dissent is typical of mayfield the frontrunner yet of all the individuals who are mentioned in my book mayfield is by all odds among the least knowledgeable and experienced he cant give the otherside of very much that happened in harlem for the simple reason that he came too late and wasnt around very long after this is the real reason he cant discuss issues it is not because of my distortions it is because mayfield doesnt know very much he is not a harlemite and knows next to nothing about harlem communist party happenings from  to  because by his own admission he didnt graduate from high school until  in washington dc after that he went into the army and to college in  he took up theater and got a role in the andersonweill production of lost in the stars which did not close until late  or early  by the time he arrived in harlem the main fireworks of  were over even then his participation was marginal to the fundamental political and cultural issues that had been argued out and fought over by the postwar younger wave of communists after a brief stint with the committee for the negro in the arts freedom newspaper the harlem writers guild and some play productions mayfield was off to puerto rico where he remained the greater part of the s it was from puerto rico that he published his first novels which were peddled for him by someone else in the meantime i and others had to uphold his right to go to puerto rico against the snide criticism of some downtown white communists who charged mayfield with running out i vocally upheld his privilege of leaving the country even though i hardly knew him personally despite my dislike for indulging in personal issues in what is purported to be an exchange of critical opinions on political and cultural issues one must often descend to such tactics when mayfield asserts that the victims of my destructive thrust are not the valid ones of wrong obsolete and untenable ideas and attitudes but a long list of artists and intellectuals many of them dead whom mr cruse happens not to like he is absolutely rightthat is in part a few of them i definitely did not like at all others i had no personal rancor against but simply didnt think much of their work or their intellectual stature for example i think both langston hughes and loften mitchell were  real nice guys whom i liked an awful lot i simply think however that a lot of langston hughes work poetry excepted was simply sloppy simplistic unpolished and of generally deteriorating quality from the s onwards i dont believe loften mitchell one of my best friends reached any real expertise as a playwright everybody raved about john o killens youngblood however i personally found it impossible to finish this novel because it had absolutely no style in the writing and reflected a social point of view which was for me naive and oversimplistic and sociologically superficial in addition to this killens has an inflated ego which is not justified in the real light of his work i considered killens war novel and then we heard the thunder his best work but also predicted that when killens would be forced to depart from autobiographical material for his thematic ideas he would lapse his last novel sippi proves this for me it is a failure an embarrassing flop which didnt surprise me at all perhaps killens will prove for me that he can write a good nonautobiographical novel but i doubt it these doubts are based not so much on personal feelings as they are on what i perceive in the novelists social outlook which is highly egostistical but often corny and also limited in terms of social perceptions on the blackwhite thing when such an outlook is also permeated with leftwing ideology it is not a point of view that is amenable to much perception in the handling of human materials this becomes a critical and cultural problem of no mean proportions let us discuss miss lorraine hansberry and the freedom newspaper episodes mayfield mentions he complains that i mention her name more than i do web du bois i mentioned mayfields name less than either of them but he is screaming the most in pain mayfield refuses to accept my stated premise for writing my book i made it more than clear in the first  pages that i was about to critically dissect the role of the black creative and professional intellectual beginning with james baldwin and his contemporaries in the course of the book i also dealt with some of the historical antecedents that have influenced these contemporary creative intellectuals naturally i deal most thoroughly with those whom i have known personally more or less before mayfield arrived at freedom newspaper i met miss hansberry there mayfield from his marginal contact with harlem realities wonders what was i doing in freedoms office well long before mr mayfield arrived i had been to freedoms office with the proposal that in addition to writing for that journal i would also see that paul robesons paper got distributed to all the harlem newsstands along lenox and seventh avenues this kind of work it may be noted was not the kind of work the freedom staff nor mayfields friends were at all interested in dirtying their hands with but i am not proud in that respect moreover we postwar harlem communists had been taught the necessity of doing all kinds of unglamorous chores such as street speaking and demonstrating newspaper selling block and house canvassing veterans work tenants work leaflet distributing fund collecting putting dispossessed peoples furniture back in their homes fending off police harassment etc etc this was the side of harlem communist activity mayfield never experienced but inside freedom newspaper office i met lorraine hansberry and found her attitude downright insulting both class and castewise besides that she was demonstrably antimale especially towards those she considered socially beneath her i noticed that eslanda goode robeson hardly ever looked at anyone in freedoms office she didnt personally know robeson himself i found usually morose and uncommunicative in contrast to the public face he usually put up for me who had been with robeson during both peekskill uprisings in  and was also one of the personal guards assigned to him after the riots when he made personal appearances in new york this was not an encouraging closeup all in all i grew to dislike the freedom newspaper staff they probably didnt like me either because i was too outspoken for their tastes so the feeling was mutual its been mutual ever since except for robeson i had no respect for their abilities or their leadership pretentions in the journalistic fields i was never impressed with either lorraine hansberrys writing abilities nor her ideas after she became famous aside from personal considerations and attitudes i considered it necessary to say these things in a book of social political literary and cultural criticism all of julian mayfields novels were overrated works and at the age of  mayfield has not matured as a novelist these are serious questions that should be critically debated by and for all those seriously concerned with black cultural problems in america mayfield believes that a lot of my harsh judgment stems from my own personal disappointments in the theater and he is absolutely correct but that is only a small part of it my own failures in the theater is nobodys fault but my own inasmuch as i never will write plays or anything else to suit anyones a priori tastes hence the story mayfield tells about my asking lorraine hansberry to read a musical play of mine is an apochryphal yarn that someone told him i never spoke to hansberry but two or three times in  on freedom newspaper and never had words with her again in fact i never knew hansberry was even in terested in theater until her play raisin in the sun was produced in  i never knew her well enough to ask her anything of that nature i will not go so far as to say that mayfield is lying for effect because it is very obvious that someone from freedoms staff told him this i have been my own harshest critic when it comes to judging my own plays none of them have been good enough to warrant my sustained effort to get them produced more than that all plays soon become dated and one must get on to new ideas my chief gripe about the theater is that we have no theater institution in which to experiment with new play ideas therefore i soon become disinterested not only with what i have written but with the theater generally thus merely to get a play produced was never for me a life and death matter neither was getting rich and famous as mayfield intimates i could have done that too a long time ago by concocting stuff for hollywood    at least i had offers this does not mean that i would object to being rich and famous it only means that getting rich and famous must come as a result of the righ creative and critical standards i set for myself as a creative individual as for mayfields moral posturing over my drinking water incident in the cuban hills he reminds me of an old gossiping spinster digging up dirt about her social rivals in an old maids coterie sure i complained about water and vocally some of us came down with severe cases of dysentery from being forced to drink water from impure springs as guests of the cuban government we had every right to complain mayfield however true to political leftwing methods of prosecution of enemies of the revolution blows up this incident into a belligerent threat against the cuban revolution unlike the hansberry allegations which was gossip someone passed on to him this time mayfield concocts a scurrilous lie about what i actually said moreover the person i complained to was no mere aide who spoke no english but the cuban poet pablo armando fernandez it is a pity that this type of political scuttlebutt should enter into this exchange but the reader should note that it is an example of the venom that accumulates in the spate of personal attacks characteristic of communist leftwing polemics i believe leroi jones was present at this completely insignificant incident and i doubt he would corroborate this falsehood while we are on this interesting question of political gossip i have an excellent suggestion for julian mayfieldas a writer of some talent mayfield is missing his own boat in the department of literary originality and sophistication he is keeping his public ignorant of some real juicy bits of scandal simply dripping with human and political er and also cultural interest relating to his short harlem writers club period in new york which also has political and human cultural connections with his glorious sojourn in the puerto rican sunshine durante y bajo el encanto de la amor grande y amorosa pardon my french this idyllic escapade to the caribbean blue surf also carried itself across the great deep to our ancestral sod in ghana i say our only as a sop to african unity cause after all my folks were pure zulu who tell me they never had anything to do with them ghanaians and that i shouldnt associate with them cause they left them white folks enslave them but i dont pay any tention to that garbage cause my folks were rather oldfashioned and conservative im with the new african unity thing now where were we oh yesmayfield with his gift of literary declamation went through that swingin odyssey and aint told us a blessed thing about it now if that har    lem writers club only had a black henry miller running their literary workshop instead of john oliver killens man alive that cat would have told us an eroticculturalliterary narrative that would have made henry millers tropics of cancer and capricorn read like a cheap sex novel about sexually deprived white folks stranded on an equatorial island in the pacific trying to negotiate foreign aid programs for the natives now please 
julian mayfields response te harold cruse
here is no need to reply at length to mr cruses pathetic attempt to cut my gums out the level of his attack should make it clear to any sensitive reader that the main thrust of my reviewarticle in which i called into question the authors basic integrity was substantially correct what for example are we to make of a wouldbe political pundit who seems to have filled his notebook with speculation about the sexual lives of people who always avoided him like the plague how are we to regard a man who fancies himself as a latterday frantz fanon but who demands of me that i join him in repeating the scurrilous rumors circulated in the western press about the private life of ghanas president kwame nkrumah mr cruse has never visited ghana nor indeed any other region of africa and his admirers should wonder why he the ultrablack nationalist derives so much satisfaction from an attempt to discredit the most progressive and prophetic leader black africa has ever had this brings us to a serious inadequacy in the authors preparation which is reflected in his work mr cruse has never been anywhere and i certainly understand why he resents those who did leave home the fact that he has as a writer seldom left new york city is not a virtue but a grave liability this accounts for the myopic inference in his book that everything worth mentioning about black intellectuals happened in manhattan thus he largely neglects chicago which has always rivaled new york as a center of black intellectual ferment washington nashville atlanta and lately los angeles are cities where black people are cooking on ideas that may have an even more profound impact on the resolution of the crisis of black intellectualism than atypical new york in such an unlikely place as cleveland there are at least a score of young black intellectuals and artists who are determined one way or the other to build a new city but of these developments mr cruse seems blithely unaware both greyhound and trailways send buses to these cities everyday and one would have thought that his publishers would have advanced him the fare then he might have understood that the intellectual brew stirring in our communities has little resemblance to the situation of those of us associated with the political left in the early postwar period my principal reason for rejecting mr cruse as a critic pundit or seer has nothing to do with anything as irrelevent as his sex life or even the fact that in all his  years he has never written or done anything meaningful so that we might judge him by his work it is simply that mr cruse does not know and not knowing should not presume to lead the average young brother and sister in the struggle whether an intellectual or not has never met an american communist yet mr cruse would have them divert their energies to a meaningless struggle that has not had significance since he was a young man in the crisis of the negro intellectual general cruse leads us to the wrong battlefield american disciples of karl marx may have done childe harold wrong but that is harolds hangup now our basic problem is how to survive in and rid ourselves of the most dangerous oppressive and imperialistic power structure the world has ever known mr cruse has a good mind and might be able to help if he did not spend so much time peeping into bedroom keyholes 
the black student and the brother in the streets
by vernon j dixon
he call is out to enroll the skills and analytical tools of the black student in furthering and shaping the black revolution in effect this call has been heeded already by those afroamerican students for whom identification with their brothers in the street does not present any difficulty the problem which arises however for these black students is concern for selecting the most viable response the feeling of oneness with his black brethren was clearly evident at an east coast conference of black students a few days after the violent expression of black anger provoked by the assassination of martin_luther_king jr one student stated the strongest feeling of the group when he asked agonizingly my black brothers are getting shot down out there what am i doing here in effect the group was seeking the optimal form to give their identification this question is more specific for the black graduate student he already possesses skills needed in the black community therefore he must compare the benefits of increasing his skills with the costs of foregoing immediate use of these skills in the black community thus for a significant number of black university and college students the prime concern is how to relate to the brothers in the street unfortunately to a large extent the process of analyzing the question occurs within an academic and social structure erected on the white american experience by definition in such an environment the black student does not find any major institutional support for his evolving black consciousness awareness acceptance articulation and development of the black experience so vital to completing the framework for resolving the question while the particular answer to this question will reflect the individuality of the black student it occurs to me that it is crucial that he understand clearly how american values are influencing him as h rap brown has said its whats in your head not whats on your head this point cannot be stressed too strongly in any theory or model which the black student develops in any policy recommendation which he derives from that theory and in concrete action which he undertakes based on that policy american values determine the very structure and direction of this process of postulation theorizing policy formulation and concrete implementation this paper explores the mind set of american values and how it may affect the choice of the black student in determining his mode of interaction with the brother in the street to unravel and to comprehend fully the operation of the american value construct requires a thirdeye view ie the black student must exercise his analytical ability to transcend his mind set this is necessary because members of universities and colleges have implanted deeply in his mind that the essential values of american civilization remain universal and eternal while simultaneously ignoring all the blunders white americans have made the american value matrix which i discuss in this paper consists of  advocacy of individualism the apotheosis of the individual  advocacy of the literal tradition which is construed to exclude the figurative tradition  advocacy of reason rather than emotion as the final arbiter of human affairs    k  before showing the linkage between these individual values in the american mind set and their effect on the black students selection of a mode of interacting with his brethren i must point out that i am no more arguing for the primacy and universality of the opposites of these values than i am for the values themselves indeed elsewhere i have set forth a way of perceiving and organizing experiences which confirms without inherent tension the copresence of differing value constructs  here i want only to examine the american mind set of values so that the black student may become conscious of the way in which it determines how he decides to interact with the brothers in the street thus some unconscious operation may become conscious and therefore offer a greater spectrum of alternatives to the black student in selecting his way of participating in the black revolution the first american value in the mind set which the black student should consider is individualism by this term i mean the apotheosis of the individual which signifies the elevation of the individual to the level of a god there is no conception of the group as a whole except as a collection of individuals each individual is defined exclusively by the way in which he differs from other individuals rather than by the way in which he is similar to them by that definition each individual exists uniquely ie the individual has the godlike properties of oneness and uniqueness in attempting to attain these characteristics the individual is apotheosizing himself individualism in this sense has important implications for the black student as he chooses his lorm of identification with his brothers in the street for example a black student who has used his skills and analytical tools to formulate a theory or to erect a model which incorporates the black experience will often be criticized by his fellow black students to the effect what you have to say is fine and good but will it reach the brother in the street can he dig what you have to say i will discuss later the implications of this remark about the ability of the brothers in the street to comprehend theoretical statements and complex propositions but for the moment i only want to suggest how that remark may reflect individualism which in turn confines the black student the black student who is predisposed towards selfapotheosis knows empirically that individuals have both unique and similar characteristics therefore the black student who desires to validate the primacy of his person must seek confirmation of his selfdeification this may be accomplished by taking his output theories models policies actions directly to the brothers in the street for their approval or disapproval having determined his brothers position the black student converts their approval or disapproval into a measure of his selfapotheosis as a result of this process the output of the black student and his assessment of his own apotheosis have become equivalent it follows that even though the concerns of the brothers in the street are the inputs analyzed by the black student the motivating force of individualism or selfapotheosis demands that his output be directly evaluated by his black brethren in the street however that requirement of direct evaluation severely constrains his output in the absence of individualism the black student is no longer directed towards his own private ends and therefore his analytical ability and skills are not used to produce output for direct evaluation by the brothers in the street models theories policies and actions not previously considered can be undertaken whether useful now or later whether approved or not approved by the brethren that output truly enlarges the spectrum of alternative definitions of the black experience in this context therefore all output derived from the input of black experience furthers the black revolution moreover the student can now allow that output to reach the brothers in the street through the mediation of other brothers without the limitation of individualism the black student has a wider range from which to select his mode of relating to his brothers in the street before discussing the other elements in the american value matrix i think the black student should realize that his concern about reaching the brothers in the street may reflect his desire to receive the adoration of his brethren in this case the black student usually acts out that desire in becoming a leader his output elicits direct approval from the brothers and he in turn has influence over their actions however the black student who seeks that approval in order to assess the primacy of himself is acting within the confines of individualism in effect that approval serves for him as the adoration necessary to confirm his selfapotheosis receiving approval and exerting influence on this basis the black student leads the black revolution along an extremely narrow road of development for a black leader influenced by individualism will not only reject output theories models policies actions from other brothers but he will also restrict the formulation of his own output such a leader will accept another brothers output only when it can be presented as originating with him in this way he seeks to maintain the adoration of the brethren in the street underlying this reaction is the fear that the primacy of his leadership will be weakened if not eliminated all this is consistent with the black leaders selfapotheosis furthermore he will perceive the true concerns of the brethren only when they concur with his own if the black revolution calls for output which will undermine the black leaders selfapotheosis and lessen his adoration he will not be able to hear the call and develop the appropriate output himself as a result this type of leader hinders the black revolution unfortunately the desire for adoration  in order to confirm the primacy of self is reinforced and implemented through the other two components of the american value matrix the literal tradition and the superiority of reason the second constituent in the mind set of american values which influences the black student is the advocacy of the literal tradition compared to the figurative tradition in this paper a literal tradition signifies the tendency to construe words oral or written in their denotative sense the importance of this stress on logical clarity is seen in the increasing trend of using mathematical language in various disciplines consequently the black student is trained to express exactly what he means if imagination is viewed as the power to represent the real more fully and truly than it appears to the senses then in figurative language imagination is actually embodied within the words in literal language imagination occurs as a result of the individuals response to the subject matter rather than to the connotation of the words themselves for example there are some white people who still believe that the word brother used among black people signifies a blood relationship compared to the literal tradition the figurative language has marvelous complexity and originality examples of this are constantly produced in current speech to some brothers in the street the words negro and uncle tom while figurative were yet too literal they wanted a word which when contraposed to black would characterize a person as one of color on the outside and white inside and the word would also indicate simultaneously the persons entire position toward the black revolution as one reflecting white racist attitudes toasty the word is a perfect illustration of the figurative tradition the problem for the black student however is the implications of the american mind set which asserts the literal tradition as the superior tradition if the black student accepts uncritically his proficiency in literal language as superior to figurative language he will limit his range of choice in se c lecting modes of relating to the brothers in the street this will occur in two ways  through false perceptions of the brethrens ability to comprehend complex propositions and  through implementing the motivation of the black student to become an apotheosistic leader concerning the first limiting effect the black student who emphasizes the literal tradition without scrutiny closes avenues of reaching the brothers in the street this student may fail to recognize that the figurative language of the black community contains extraordinarily complex nuances and profound ideas they have not been articulated in the literal form as leroi jones has pointed out when a blind hopeless black preacher says god dont never change a precise thing is being said the preacher does not mean god does not ever change he means exactly god dont never change in terms of the human referent of the black community this is a profound statement on the deterministic order of the world in effect the figurative language of the brother in the street has its own logical clarity there is a failure to perceive this complex system of expression when the black student accepts the literal tradition as the superior one consequently if the complexity in the figurative tradition is not rec w ognized then the ability of the users of that language to comprehend involved propositions is not perceived a broader avenue to discerning the interests of the brothers in the street is closed this may be inferred from the remark of the black students mentioned previously ie what you have to say is fine and good but can the brothers dig it to such black students complex ideas can not reach the brothers in the street because the brethren are not capable of understanding them all propositions must be simple so they can dig what you say it follows that no attempt is made to explore systematically the figurative tradition of the brothers in the street in order to preserve to enrich and to develop the strengths of that tradition and to communicate figuratively to the brethren their meaning for black identity the second way in which acceptance of the superiority of the literal tradition limits modes of relating is through implementing the tendency of the black student to become a leader in order to achieve his own apotheosis since the black student is conversant with both languages the literal group requires him to serve as their translator of the figurative tradition it is quite easy for the black student to use literal language as a tool to prove to the literal group that only he can interpret to them the concerns of the brothers in the street should this student be motivated at the same time by selfapotheosis it follows for him that only he can lead the brethren moreover in relating to the figurative group such a leader will use the literal language to falsely discredit any challenges to his selfapotheosis he demands that the threatening brother in the street state his ideas in literal form define your terms and say exactly what you mean during the time this type of leader is functioning through language manipulation he hinders development of the black revolution since he cannot recognize the ability of the brethren to comprehend complex propositions such a leader can neither perceive  nor translate the true concerns of the black community if at any time he does so it will be fortuitous and not the result of communication with the group additionally he cannot communicate with the brethren on a complex figurative level thereby being unable in a broad sense to perform an educational role thus a black student who seeks selfdeified leadership has at best a narrow range of approaches to interacting with his brothers these avenues of communication are not widened by the influence of the third element in the mind set of american values the stress on reason over and against emotion the advocation of reason as the final arbiter in human affairs together with the two preceding components of the value matrix reduce alternative forms of identification before the black student can see this linkage he must recognize the connection between the process of reasoning and the process of administrationthe latter being a common way in which a black student relates to his brethren reason in one sense signifies the capacity to extract implications from a combination of facts or suppositionsthe power of comprehending and inferring inherent in this process is that particular act of transcending the apparent meaning of the combination in order to comprehend and infer a further meaning which was not immediately apparent this act i have termed overviewing an administrator performs this same function of overviewing when he coordinates activity to accomplish some common purpose if reasoning is viewed as superior it is very easy to transfer this same superiority to the process of administration indeed to an administrator motivated by selfapotheosis the act of overviewing can be interpreted by him as evidence of his primacy moreover inherent in the administrative process is the discretionary power to select based on his overview the optimal way of achieving a common goal to a selfapotheosistic administrator the way chosen must be optimal for the true concerns of the group in effect this type of black administrator like the corresponding leader causes the same harm that results from a narrow range of approaches to interacting with the brother in the street unfortunately this harm is increased when such an administrator also accepts the literal tradition as the superior one on one side this type of administrator cannot recognize ideas expressed figuratively on the other side the brother in the street cannot express these ideas literally therefore a selfapotheosistic black administrator cannot overview the true interests of the brethren and he probably will not select the optimal approach to their attainment consequently in becoming an administrator or a leader the black student selects as his form of identification one which can be most destructive to the black revolution if it is determined by the entire american value matrix  it is now clear that this mind set of values reduces the alternatives open to the black student the implications for the student who transcends that mind set are too numerous to be exhausted here the black community will offer him many opportunities which have not yet been realized in turn this may lead him to formulate new postulates theories policies and actions if he approaches the black community unhandicapped he may discover such strengths as nonindividualistic concern for communal interests the institution of the extended family and rich cultural forms of which the figurative tradition is only one instance these may stimulate him to develop meaningful output which will preserve those strengths without transforming them into a new value matrix which is advocated as universal and eternal the black student who becomes a leader or an administrator could then regard himself as a man of the hour one who is entrusted temporarily with the implementation of the brethrens interest but who also generates his own replacement by the appropriate means thus the wider range of alternatives available to the black student provide greater potentiality for a successful black revolution

n may   the united nations security council unanimously passed a britishsponsored resolution enjoining all members of the un to impose total trade and economic sanctions against southern rhodesia the resolution was only the latest of several others adopted by various organs of the world organization against the rebellious british colony in which  white settlers have carved a cosy niche for themselves by suppressing nearly  african inhabitants of the country on last june  the british house of lords defeated its own governments orderincouncil seeking to validate the un sanctions program at this writing the labor government of prime minister harold wilson was reported preparing another order which it was expected would be adopted by both houses of the british parliament what it may be asked do these developments mean what in fact is the essence of the rhodesian problem and how effectively may we expect international action to help resolve it there are two important factors underlying the whole rhodesia problem which deserve more attention than has been given them in all the diplomatic manoeuvring at the un and in all the innumerable commentaries that have been written on the issue failure to analyse and articulate these factors has led to a lot of wishful thinking and the flourishing of rampant hypocrisy the two most important factors underlying the rhodesian problem relate to the countrys position as an integral part of the geopolitics of southern africa and to the role of britain itself in the emergence and consolidation of minority settler hegemony in that unhappy country rhodesia has developed historically as an extension of south africa culminating with the present situation in which she has become a south african satellite as for britain her role has consisted in condoning and encouraging the processes whereby rhodesia has become a pocketsize south africa taking these factors into account and having regard to the western worlds massive and abiding support of south africa the un sanctions against rhodesia cannot but prove hollow and pathetically futile they cannot succeed because they have been formulated on the erroneous assumption that rhodesia can be totally quarantined and left to suffocate slowly to death but this cannot be done because rhodesiadue to economic diplomatic and racial factorsprobably can boast richer and more reliable friends than any african country she certainly cannot be economically ruined let alone starved to death by the kind of resolution that the un recently passed rhodesias links with south africa date back to the countrys colonization towards the end of the th century that colonization was spearheaded by arch empirebuilder cecil rhodes a british african tycoon and onetime prime minister of the cape colony now cape province of south africa by use of trickery and armed might the country was won for the british empire in  the band of marauders used for this purpose were hired in south africa at rhodes own expense despite their determined and heroic resistance particularly between  and  the africans of zimbabwe the countrys proper name were finally subdued and foreign rule firmly installed from that time on rhodesia developed virtually as an appendage of south africa roads railroads communication lines etc were established linking the country with south africa moreover south africa supplied most of the new colonys needs of imported capital and consumer goods of various kinds in addition to this rhodesia provided a convenient haven for any spillover of south africas white population so that as of today well over  percent of the settler population of rhodesia is of south african origin as might be expected the effect of these developments was that rhodesias economic political and social institutions and practices emerged basically as faithful replicas of south african patterns and practices not surprisingly therefore all the ugly features of south african apartheid have come to have very close parallels in rhodesiaexpropriation of african land over   percent of the total land area being reserved for current and future european use rigid separation of the races territorially socially etc imposition of the most oppressive and humiliating codes of law on the african majority including pass laws curfew regulations in urban areas constant police surveillance and harassment the denial of meaningful political rights to africans has been the central tenet of settler rule and this has never been seriously questioned even by the most liberal settler politicians thus africans have been denied the vote through the imposition of various qualifications which are carefully and cynically trimmed to include all whites and to exclude all but a token number of blacks open political organization among africans has virtually been proscribed on a permanent basis between  and  five major african political parties were banned and hundreds of their leaders and followers placed in jail and concentration camps without trial and in most cases for indefinite periods it may be noted here that throughout this period britain as the imperial power with overall responsibility for the destiny of the colony never once lifted a finger against the perpetration of these outrages by her immigrant nationals indeed successive british governments extended greater powers to the settlers whenever the latter sought to broaden their stranglehold on the country thus for example in  rhodesia was granted socalled responsible selfgovernment in  she was allowed to pass the iniquitous land apportionment act which is the sheetanchor of the racist structure of the country in  rhodesian settlers conspired with those in the then northern rhodesia now zambia and the then nyasaland now malawi to concoct the central african federation despite african opposition in  britain in league with the settlers imposed a thoroughly undemocratic constitution on rhodesia in spite of vehement african opposition to the scheme and when the un at the initiative of ghana tried in  to pass a resolution barring rhodesia from acquiring the military equipment of the defunct central african federation britain vetoed that particular resolution it is unnecessary to illustrate further the accuracy and validity of our original contention that rhodesia developed as a miniature south africa and that she was aided and abetted in this process by the same british government which today pretends quite hypocritically to be leading the sanctions war against that country the extent of south african involvement has not  of course been limited to the general politicoideological influences of the sort we have alluded to since the illegal declaration of independence by the ian smith regime south africa has moved in to stabilize and bolster the rhodesian economy  trade between the two countries has increased phenomenally rhodesia has been offered convenient credit facilities for the purchase inor through south africa of essential commodities and weapons of war for the suppression of the african liberation forces inside rhodesia south africa has facilitated the process whereby rhodesia has been able to continue trading with the rest of the world by the device of setting up dummy companies in south africa which then channel goods to and from rhodesia the point about all this is that south africa has a vital interest in the situation in rhodesia she obviously calculates that the fall of rhodesia would bring the forces of african liberation to her own doorsteps and will therefore fight to prevent this eventuality above all south africa realizes that the fall of a regime founded on the same racist principles as herself would have a profound moral and psychological effect on south africa conversely the endurance of the rhodesian regime can be expected to bolster the morale of the south african racists and to ensure the security of south africas northern frontiers these considerations have therefore impelled south africa to actively support the rhodesia settler dictatorship economically diplomatically and militarily elements of the south african army air force and police force are presently serving in rhodesia against zimbabwe guerrilla forces taking these factors into account to suppose that south africa might abandon rhodesia would be laughable were it not also a tragic form of selfdeception south africa cannot now nor ever will abandon rhodesia unless the military costs to her become excessively unbearable our analysis thus points to the inescapable conclusion that un sanctions against rhodesia can only have at the very most an extremely peripheral effect on the total situation the sanctions could conceivably produce a dent on the props of the rhodesian economy were they also to be applied against south africa which country after all at the very minimum richly deserves that treatment but it would be naive even to dream that the un could take action of a radical nature against south africa after all that countrys best friends the usa britain and france are blessed with oermanent seats a on the un security council just to ensure no gaps are left unplugged despite these and other western countries eloquent and colorful oratory denouncing apartheid we can expect their active involvement in the gilded muck of the south african situation to con ft tinue or even to grow apace the most we can expect of collective international action against the modern hitlers of south africa are lots of wordy resolutions liberally larded with gratuitous free world advice cautioning against precipitous and irresponsible action against the criminal perpetrators of apartheid this type of preachy and condescending paternalism has almost become routine at the un it becomes clear from the foregoing that the vote of the house of lords in support of ian smith referred to at the start of this article cannot be treated as the impulsive act of a few oldfashioned british imperialist peers that vote represented widelylaid sympathies for rhodesia among virtually all significant sectors of british public opinion including the governing labor party itself the only real difference between mr wilson and his baronial opponents is that the latter have tactlessly and needlessly exposed britain instead of sensibly coating the pill of anglorhodesian collusion with the sugar of all the sweet talk about fairplay etc the position adopted by the british lords after all been given open and nearfanatical expression to by no less a personage than former u s secretary of state dean acheson see washington post dec   as an example acheson cloaks his support for the rhodesian settlers in pseudolegalistic terms arguing with ridiculous abandon that to impose sanctions against rhodesia is a contravention of the un charter on the basis of this puerile legalistic nonsense acheson evidently hopes to have the u s openly recognize and support the rhodesian settler dictatorship thus far from lacking friends abroad rhodesia probably has a surfeit of these at all levels we are not even including such groups as the birchites etc in view of the foregoing factors it would have been suicidal for zimbabwe africans to have placed any hopes on the un to help their liberation every indication points to the inescapable fact that the initiative and responsibility for effecting that liberation must lie with the zimbabweans themselves while they may receive support from abroad such support can only be complimentary to their own efforts this is not to decry outside help by any means for such help is certainly needed in view of the formidable forces against which zimbabwe freedom fighters are ranged but external support cannot constitute the decisive element here no doubt zimbabweans will triumph over their internationallysupported oppressors when the hour of reckoning arrives however we shall all be the wiser for having travelled through the current difficulties and thus being enabled to see who were our true friends and who our bitter enemies that lesson cannot be lost upon the present generation of zimbabweans

poverty with its accompanying ramshackle housing containing neither plumbing nor lights and a plantation system that bordered on serfdom had left the people dehumanized and defeated hearing of these bleak and grim conditions rekindled an idea miss jackson had long held that educated professional black people should take the initiative in helping the less fortunate of the race if they were to be reached at all she felt the wav to better conditions at that time was to conduct a summer school for rural black teachers illiterate adults and children endowed with the noblest of all emotionsenthusiasm  and dripping with go she immediately sought help from others of like mind and using her own funds she scheduled the first summer school for six weeks in  at the school in lexington mississippi for which the cotton field singers had been concertizing to raise funds however before the six weeks were over it was evident that the overwhelming need was for health care and health education in lexington and the surrounding rural country disease and poverty were rampant among families whose median income was  a year some of the teachers and pupils attending the summer school would get up at  am to work in the fields before walking three seven and eight miles to school but those not suffering from contagious diseases  pellagra syphilis  were nutritionally starved from an unbroken diet of the msmeat meal and molasses the nittygritty need wasnt education but immediate health care  more convinced than ever that the educated and trained black individual had a responsibility to take the lead in alleviating the grinding poverty of the less fortunate and having become national president of her sorority alpha kappa alpha she proposed to her sorors the idea of a health clinic at lexington after initiating and completing plans for this and after persuading the membership to vote the funds she found doctors to participate and interested other members in voluntarily helping during their summer vacations the plans to set up a permanent health clinic at lexington immediately ran into a period of sturm und drang from white plantation owners always fearful of outside agitators they would not allow the blacks to leave the plantations to attend the clinic it became necessary to reorganize the clinic and to take the services to the plantations and carry on under the watchful eyes of the overseers this innovation was a firsttime use of mobile health clinics and it proved to be best for this first year as more people were reached in isolated areas who would not have been able to come to a central clinic even with the consent of the plantation boss most of the blacks had never had any medical attention and eagerly attended the clinics many had never seen a black woman doctor or dentist and they felt proud that their own race was trying to help them for eight summers doctors nurses teachers and dentists from the sorority membership volunteered each summer to take health services to areas not previously visited over these years  children were immunized against diphtheria and smallpox thousands of adults were treated for malaria syphilis and dental needs each child received a new toothbrush and instructions in its use expectant mothers and children with rickets were provided with protective food concentrates a trailer kitchen was added to educate the sharecropper families to plant kitchen gardens to vary their m diets in the first summer of operation the mobile caravan covered over  miles leaving behind less misery illness relief and hope the earlier attitude of hostility from plantation owners changed to one of cooperation and welcome the second summer the clinic was shifted to bolivar county distinguished at that time by the fact that no insurance company would issue policies to its residents because of the poor health conditions and the high sickness rate the white health officer of the county welcomed the clinic and helped the sorority to establish a permanent base at the allblack town of mound bayou he also helped to advertise the clinic by having circulars printed contacting plantation owners and ministers and posting notices at one twoday session over  patients attended the results in bolivar county where the population was almost threequarters black was that the residents became healthconscious and the clinics were crowded a black fraternal order which was planning to build an office building in mound bayou changed its plans and built a modern bcd hospital the first and only one for blacks in the county at the end of each summer session of the clinic the county continued the malaria and syphilis treatments with drugs donatcu by the sorority as a demonstration project the purpose of which was to arouse official agencies to the pressing need for medical services and their responsibility for providing equal care for all groups the late dr thomas parran former surgeongeneral of the united states called the eightyear project one of the best jobs of volunteer public health work i have ever seen the work of the alpha kappa alpha health project attracted the attention of the late president franklin d roosevelt and miss jackson was invited to be his guest at the nations christmas tree lighting ceremony as founder and general director of the project miss jackson received an invitation from mrs roosevelt to attend along with the clinics medical director a conference at the white house to discuss operation of the clinics and other health problems mrs roosevelt became an honorary

the thick whipping
by louise m meriwether
et me the razor strop francie  i it dont whip m e mother get me that strop i went into the bathroom and took daddys razor strop off the rusty nail and walked back into the dining room and handed it to mother her light brown face plump like the rest of her was quivering with anger i had already started to whimper i only asked him for a nickel mother and it wasnt like asking a stranger the bastard had ratted on me my own uncle he was the only colored man we knew in harlem who had a steady job and daddy was always saying how lucky his brotherinlaw was cause the depression was so bad even the ofays couldnt find jobs leastways a negro it was  and almost everybody was on relief including us uncle hiram was so stingy though that he never offered you a cent so i put it on his mind and asked him for a nickel and he squealed to mother soons she came home from her daywork in the bronx mother advanced on me and i saw with horror how she was holding that strop you aint gonna beat me with the thick end i couldnt believe it and i knocked down a chair getting out of her way mother kept on coming in all of my  years i had never before been beaten with the thick end not because i was all that good but because i was a girl and daddys pet you got whipped with the thick end of the strop when you did something real bad otherwise you got a lick or two with the thin end daddy was always whipping on my brothers butts with that thick end especially james junior  who had joined the ebony dukes and was running wild daddy said james junior was gonna disgrace us all sterling  quiet and moody didnt get whipped much any more i aint gonna chase you all over this room mother said and she snatched me and dragged me into her bedroom and flung me down on the bed i was too longlegged to be put across her lap so she sort of kneeled on my back and pulled  down my bloomers with one hand raising the strop with the other i told you before and i aint gonna tell you again you dont beg nobody for nothing each word was punctuated with a lash on my bare behind and i screamed so loud that mothers words got lost but i got the message when she was through mother went into the kitchen to wash some clothes while i sat there on her bed whimpering thinking my dinner hadnt been worth this whipping i had asked uncle hiram for that nickel so i could eat at father divines not that there wasnt something to eat at home mother always saw to that even if it was nothing but that gold can jive we got from the relief place which nobody in harlem would eat no matter how it was doctored up with onions and tomato paste the yellow label said it was canned beef but the rumor was it was horsemeat so we called it the gold can jive and it was weighing down the shelves in everybodys cupboards they also gave out butter and dried prunes at the relief place and our social worker who we called madame queen cause she was so snobbish acted like it was her instead of president roosevelt who was giving us the relief money and all that stuff daddy hadnt wanted to go on relief in the first place but mother kept complaining we was starving on the few bucks he made collecting numbers for frenchy a creole who ran a candy store on fifth avenue as a front for his policy business daddy finally agreed that mother could do housework for three days a week if she would just stop bugging him but a month later still complaining mother also applied for relief daddy hollered and cursed something awful but mother told him his pride wouldnt feed us and that was that anyway after uncle hiram gave me the nickel i had  cents and i walked up to th street to father divines place because i hated the greasy collard greens and fat back we had at home and i wanted one of fathers  cents chicken dinners peace its wonderful father divines place was a storefront i paid my  cents at the door and found a seat at the round table in the middle of the room fathers followers and other people like me who were just plain hungry were jammed tight around that table gulping down their food with no side talk whatever one of fathers angels a huge black woman dressed in a bed sheet her hair nappier than the day she was bom brought me a plate of golden brown chicken from the kitchen she nodded at the bread and vegetables on the table meaning for me to help myself instead of grace you had to praise fathers holy name so i turned to the man next to me and said father divine is god would you please pass me that plate of blackeye peas  when i finished eating i walked back home skirting mount morris park i liked the food at father divinesyou got more than you could eat for fifteen centsbut i always had to go alone none of my friends would come with me not even becky they were ashamed of those nappyheaded angels who wouldnt straighten their hair and wore white robes and changed their names to beloved theresa or sweet morning glory when they entered fathers kingdom i sat on mothers bed sulking about my whipping for about twenty minutes until mother called me to go to the store i walked into the kitchen its walls greasestained and peeling and mother handed me a list of things to buy and the credit book i hated to go to mr wellmans the grocer but seeing as how i just had gotten my butt whipped i didnt dare say a thing so i went on downstairs becky was sitting on my stoop i dont have to go to mr wellmans no more she said i told my mother this morning i just wasnt going did she slap you up side your head i asked no she sent nancy instead becky was almost  and had those pretty west indian eyes with lights flashing in them nancy was her younger sister as i crossed fifth avenue dragging my feet to postpone the agony i wished i had a younger sister to send to the store i didnt mind mr wellman so muchhe was a nice roly poly west indianbut it was his wife and their snotty little girl yolanda that got next to me our relief money never got any further than mr wellmans and daddy said wed never get out of the hole that way after we paid mr wellman what we owed him we were broke so we started buying things on credit again the next day and his fat slob wife never failed to look at you crosseyed after you ordered all those bags of groceries and then held out the credit book instead of money i opened the door to the store and mourned my bad luck mrs wellman was behind the counter and yolanda ten plump and lightskinned like her mother with two black braids hanging to her shoulders was perched on a high stool next to the rice sack hello mrs wellman hello yolanda they both grunted at me ten cents worth of dried herrings i said its  cents a pound mrs wellman stared at me my mother only wants ten cents worth my voice sank lower she threw the herrings on the scale and snatched them off before i could see how much she had given me i read the rest of the items off the list and watched as mrs wellman wrote the prices down on a large paper bag and added them up that will be two dollars and ten cents i held out the credit book mrs wellman stared at it like she had never seen it before which was silly she saw it almost every day when do you all get your relief money she asked the first of the month mrs wellman she knew it was the first she knew it she knew it finally she took the book and mumbling under her breath wrote the figure in it stuffed the groceries into the bag and shoved them over the counter towards me as i walked out the door yolandas eyes burned a hole in my back she never played with the rest of us and i dont know why me and becky let her upset us so after all she was only  but she sat there on that stool silent and snotty making me feel that it wasnt only her store but her world and i had no place in it nobody goes to bed early in harlem in the summer cause its too hot to sleep so although it was close to midnight me and mother were still up she had finished washing and was sitting in her room figuring out the number for tomorrow daddy had taught her his system i was sitting at the dining room table reading a library book armed with my usual supply of weapons tonight i had a hammer a screwdriver and two hairbrushes when i heard a noise i threw the hammer towards the kitchen and the rats scurried back into their holes i was scared peeless by those rats they had already bitten everybody except me and mother and had run a cat we once had clean out of his mindchased him right into the living room wall i bet that cat kept on running until he got to brooklyn those rats grew fat on the rat poison mother was always putting down on raw potato slices and they thrived on the sulphur bombs mother was always gassing us with when i got down to my last weapon i would give up the dining room to them and go on to bed i couldnt keep my mind on my book though cause i was worried about my brothers wondering where they were so late and hoping they would beat daddy home so he wouldnt whip their behinds again i had just thrown the screwdriver down the hall when there was a sudden banging on the dining room door sudden noises scared me they usually meant something terrible had happened so i just sat there with my heart pounding not making a move whats the matter with you francie mother grumbled as she went to the door cant you hear all that banging you act more like an idiot each day it was true i was getting scared of everything it was mrs maceo our nextdoorneighbor breathing hard from her climb up to the top floor mr coffin home she asked lord they done stabbed mr edwards who done stabbed him mother asked i don know he laying down there in the hallway with an ice pick in his chest mother told mrs maceo that daddy wasnt home and they ran down the stairs with me trailing behind them the hallway was full of kids and there was papa dan mrs maceos husband stone drunk and drooling as usual the naked bulb hanging from the ceiling threw tall shadows on the wall and cast a halo around mr edwards our janitor lying so bloody and still at the foot of the stairs daddy came through the vestibule door and knelt beside him you kids go on back outside he ordered they retreated as far as the doorway jessie run across the street to the drugstore and call the ambulance mother rushed outside a crowd had gathered on the stoop and i searched their faces until i found my brothers they were there thank god james junior had daddys dark good looks while me and sterling were plain like mother daddy said though that i was pretty but both me and mother agreed he had strange ideas on the subject often claiming some thicklipped gal was a black beauty i was skinny and rusty and looked a mess i knew and couldnt understand it when people said i looked just like daddy james junior pushed his way through the crowd and came to me you all right francie i nodded james junior was sweet like that old moody sterling didnt even look in my direction just kept frowning and staring at the blood on mr edwards chest the police arrived first then the whitecoated ambulance doctors and suddenly all that was left of our janitor was a red stain on the dirty tile floor i had lived in harlem all of my life and should have been used to stabbings and shootings and sudden death especially in the summertime when the heat seemed to spur everybody to violence but i wasnt used to it and that night when i closed my eyes all i could see was mr edwards lying in that hallway so still so still he died the next day in harlem hospital it was rumored he had hit the number for a dollar with a runner from uptown who swore mr edwards hadnt put the number in that day mr edwards raved he would kill the sonofabitch and  it was thought he just had got done in first but the police never did arrest that runner niggers killing niggers dont interest these cops daddy mumbled to mother a few days later mother didnt say anything but my eyes met hers and i saw fear in themfear that it could have been daddy lying in that bloody hallway and i realized for the first time that i wasnt the only one in that house whose heart was always beating like a drum our jewish landlord who lived in white plains offered daddy the janitors job and it became our lot to pull the garbage mop down the stairs and keep the backyard clean which was none too easy because it was simpler to throw garbage out of the window into the yard than to wait until six oclock when the garbage was pulled that dumbwaiter was a filthy slimy mess a permanent home for cockroaches and rats and i would just as soon open the window myself and sling the garbage out than open that dumbwaiter door daddy got up at five oclock in the morning to start the furnace in the basement before somebody started banging on the pipes for hot water but he made junior and sterling bank the fire at night and that kept them a little closer to home it was on account of that janitors job that madame queen cut us off relief daddy didnt get any pay for being the janitor just a reduction in rent and he didnt tell madame queen this right away so when she found out she cut us off daddy told her hed planned to tell her in about a month by the time he could break even with mr wellman but she didnt believe him as good as called daddy a liar mother said she would help out by doing three more days a week for her white ladys sister they dont give you enough money to live on daddy raved at mother so either you have to bootleg some kind of work or hit the number or rob somebody so your kids wont starve and anything you do is against the law damn bastards didnt i tell you in the first place i wanted nothing to do with these social workers but daddy didnt say mother couldnt work three more days so she did just that and was gone every day now except sunday now that mother was away so much we didnt eat dinner together any more my brothers came home at different times and ate in the kitchen daddy would put on some mustard greens and when i came home from school i would turn them off and cook a pot of rice daddy was a geechie so we had rice every day me and that rice it was either scorched or a soggy mess once daddy looked at it with disgust that day it was soggy why in hell dont you teach this girl to cook a decent pot of rice he roared at mother my feelings were hurt mother didnt bother to answer her silence saying louder than words that he was home all day so why didnt he teach me himself you a moron or something he turned on me that you cant cook a decent pot of rice my tears were instant i measure it out just like you do daddy only it gets dry while its still raw so i add more water the gas the gas daddy yelled he was always yelling these days youve got the damn gas turned up too high you dont boil rice you steam it the sight of my tears didnt make him turn gentle as it usually did he finished eating and banged out of the house mumbling that it was a goddamn shame a man couldnt get a decent pot of rice in his own house i felt bad for hours cause daddy seldom hollered at me but after that i didnt cook any more soggy pots of rice  it was summer and we had been off relief for two months when mother finally hauled me down to the relief office with her things were so tight we were eating that gold can jive and i swear it was horsemeat it was that stringy  mrs maceo told mother she ought to go on down to the relief office and pitch a bitch that was the only way to get anything mrs maceo said she put some soap in her mouth and went to that office foaming like a mad dog and didnt leave until they gave her a clothing allowance for her daughter mother told mrs maceo she would do likewise but i knew mother wasnt about to pitch no fit the relief place was across the street from mount morris park and all we did was sit around that office all day long seeing one supervisor then waiting years to see the supervisors supervisor what a system we had been there since nine oclock and had seen four people and it was almost three now mother was sitting at the desk of our fifth interviewer and i was standing by her side this one whose bumpy thin face was screwed into a frown like she was smelling piss all day long was the head flunky i hoped she preached at mother like she was a thief for trying to get even so all our checks wouldnt have to go to mr wellman we had sinned she made that clear they all did if daddy hadnt reported his janitors job why hadnt mother ratted on him it was her duty to her children to be truthful and godfearing did mother realize she had violated section g of the relief code mother was apologetic she didnt report that she too was bootlegging domestic work or they would have deducted money for that also she hung her head guilty and spoke softly she would never violate the rules again the lord knew but her children were hungry please forgive us our sins this one time and give us our daily bread and another supply of dried prunes and butter and that gold can crap i sat there looking like a ragpicker in my scuffed sneakers and patched skirt one of mothers hungry children wideeyed and innocent go screw yourself i said silently to the pimply face who was humbling my mother i was too mad to cry i would have yelled out loud or hit the woman who suddenly looked like madame queen they all did were it not for the look on my mothers face where had i seen that look before at whose funeral and i knew suddenly by the pain in my mothers eyes that she was beating herself with the thick end of the razor strap thats how we got back on relief the next week the checks started again and we were soon back in hock to mr wellman daddy never did ask mother how she got us back on and mother never did tell him had he known he would have disowned us both few problems and set limited as well as long range goals it becomes difficult to see progress to experience success and to feel a sense of accomplishment it is important for black groups to define their problems and the purpose of the group clearly to set out specific short and long range goals and to decide how they will measure success and determine progress this will ease much of the psychological frustration which builds up and becomes a depressive discouraging and divisive factor in the experiences of an organization related to this goal definition is an often found stumbling block in black groups which we will call the inability to set limits due in part to the need to speak up and to release rage and due in part to their lack of an agenda and a program much time in meetings of some black groups is spent testifying that is members very often stand up to testify to their dedication and acceptability as black militants they will display militant credentials and try to outblack each other they may harangue against honkies proclaim what they are going to do and put down other people as being uncle toms and handkerchief heads in essence they assume a blacker than thou attitude the problem with this behavior is that it becomes an end in itself in addition it tends to place a premium on militancy and personal qualities which soon become so exclusive that no one is black enough or down enough to be acceptable this all then becomes selfdefeating since members try to outdo each other and in the process exclude most of the group members on the other hand if goals were established it would be easier for group members to determine the acceptability of other members that is if the purpose of the group was to solicit money it would not be harmful for members to have white persons as friends in fact this could be advantageous however to take an extreme example if the purpose of the group was to arm itself for armed combat against whites it would be unrealistic to expect a black person married to a white person to participate wholeheartedly on the basis of the purpose and program of an organization therefore criteria could be more easily and less arbitrarily established what very often happens in these groups is that people are excluded on the basis of others feelings about who should be in and who should be out two more phenomena often seen in the meetings and behavior of black organizations prevent them from functioning effectively the first is the concentration on terminology and namecalling and the second is the severe negativism of certain group members an inordinate amount of meeting time is often spent arguing over terminology black groups will debate whether to use the term negro afroamerican or black and forget the major problems at hand this propensity to get sidetracked by peripheral issues happens too often in the life of black organizations for them not to recognize this as a destructive tendency when the discussions are over and the smoke clears the enemy is still white racism and all energies should be directed towards eliminating this discussions in black groups many times get bogged down and sidetracted by namecalling instead of recognizing differences among members but valuing the common cause individuals will begin to call some people uncle toms bourgeois or bourgies conservatives footshufflers black caucasians and a variety of other uncomplimentary names the members seem to lose sight of their common black identity and to see divisions and differences rather than similarities and group needs whether we approve or not there is a growing sense of black unity and solidarity as more and more afroamericans come to feel that their survival depends more upon group strength than upon individual strength presently many of these new groups are hampered by psychological difficulties much of which stems from the effects on blacks of a white racist heritage with time these newlyformed black groups will grow in effectiveness and have a potential to contribute a great deal to the progress of amity among americans 
mayfield i dont want to go around mouthing all that gossip about the extraliterary activities of harlem writers guild which leaped across into puerto rico and havana and then to our ancestral pads in accra i love my black writers especially if they are black all i aims to see em do man is to excel and make it but damn mayfield here you are sittin on all that fantastical experience about black writers in love and also exile with your poor readers thirsting for knowledge literary exaltation and a bit of honest healthy sensuous titillation come on now julian m bare your soul and tell all be a real literary adventurer a black lover with soul syntax an eagle eye for truth plus the right political line in your heart even if poor kwame nkrumah did goof give us the livin lowdown on what went down in ghana your readership will applaud posterity will enshrine you in literary sainthood and ill swear youll never have to make another movie as long as you live unless its from your new book the milk train doesnt stop in accra anymore the negro digest readership will not of course have any inkling at all of what i am here alluding to but it is to be understood that i am not of a mind to be spreading gossip as it came to me i would rather have mayfield supply the real truth about ghana and why he split accra for spain which used to own puerto rico julian was so involved in telling the readers about his conversations with intellectual royalty web du bois in ghana that i was licking my chops with anticipation i thought he might be leading up to some inside gossip pardon that word about kwame nkrumahs egyptian love who i am told was sent to nkrumah by nasser beautifully wrapped whatever happened to her also what happened to the first mrs nkrumah perhaps julian m is politically coy out of respect for kwames downfall well i can appreciate such sentiments i too loved kwame despite his goof but really julian m had open access to nkrumahs castle and the open sesame to a whole lot of official secrets    the reader should understand that i am not at all interested in spreading gossip about the political and amorous misadventures of our black literary lions i am simply one who feels that there are very often close connections between love and politics which some black writers ought to explore in search of new themes after all john oliver killens julian mayfield and others conducted a workshop where i assume the problem of themes in black must have been debated at some length so after  consideration of the fact that julian m hasnt published a novel in several years and after reading that disastrous last book of killens called sippi i have to wonder why is it that both killens and mayfield both allowed all that good luscious truelife material out of the harlem writers guilds early days to go completely to waste if mayfield refuses for good reasons to play the black henry miller then killens ought to step forth and rescue the black novel from the limbo of the protest civilwritism of the denatured black soul and tell it like it is or like it was indemdays    but get thismayfield says to me   there is nothing in the life which has been honestly lived that should be ignored if history happens to take any account of you  if a man like du bois could confess that he was wrong    then certainly people like cruse and myself ought to have the guts to admit to murder and rape man now that allusion to rape was a freudian slip if  ever heard one because i am told that in the harlem writers guild  well enough i await julian mayfield to follow his own advice on that score and write now again back to our cuban adventure mayfield in exposing my terrible unrevolutionary conduct managed to forget to mention the conduct of his colleague sarah wright who embarrassed us all by returning from the cuban hills to  the hotel presidente about nine oclock in the morning and demanding that the waiters bring her a rum daiquiri from the hotel bar which was not in the habit of opening until late in the afternoon our social and political stock sure took a deep dip that day in havana when our cuban hosts heard about that miss wright didnt simply ask she was arrogant about it    then there was the case of sarah wrights husband    passing spot judgments on cuban race relations    as a white man he did not even belong in our delegation because castro had asked for a contingent of black writers however in the leftwing whites are allowed to do as they please in black affairs and i didnt hear mayfield complaining then there was the case of the writer whose name i wont mention who demanded that the cuban government pay the hotel for a bottle of liquor he ordered that was the first of a series of unrevolutionary examples of bad conduct which occurred before i cried for water in the hills i could tell more but i dont like too much gossip mayfields problem is that he never fully understood the movement he was only marginally a part of he came into the harlem movement from his broadway role in lost in the stars and touched the harlem party only as far as its cultural fringes thus he functioned in the privileged and exclusive segment of the party the other side which he purports to tell about he doesnt really know it seems that nobody but mayfield is vague about who and what was the harlem writers club in its conflict with communist party headquarters in harlem i think i made this explicit enough but not enough for mayfield this is because mayfield does not know that in  black nationalism was not a trend in the communist party at all however any black party member who challenged the role of whites in the harlem party structure was immediately labeled a bourgeois antiwhite nationalist that is what i was called but black nationalist and black nationalism were not in our vocabulary at that time what mayfield is really complaining about is that i didnt tell enough about me personally it was however not my intentions to write an autobiography about my exploits in the party that is another kind of a book if i had written an autobiography of my marxist career it would have necessitated indulging in the same kind of gossip that mayfield indulges in in his challenge and it is good thing i didnt he is so unknowledgeable about the harlem party affairs that he makes this statement  in  he cruse was upandcoming marxist theoretician not a black nationalist and not a mere rankandfiler like the rest of us i can remember how we youngsters looked up to him because he functioned on a policymaking level speaking from a background of such authority cruse could no doubt tell us more than he has in his book and the average reader would understand how he came to know so much as we have already decided i hope not prematurely that cruse is not bucking for a job in washington my only conclusion is that he wants to be sure he is in step with the younger militants by establishing a background that he has always been antiwhite and antiintegrationist this statement is laughable and infantile because i was never on a policymaking level and mayfield was never any rankandfiler i was the chairman of the harlem writers club which was the pioneer black communist writers group established in harlem after the war mayfield obviously never knew what constituted the policymaking level in harlem or what actually went on there it was those communist leaders on the harlem policy making level who did not want the harlem writers club to exist at all this writers club was harassed by the leadership in harlem from its very inception to the time it disbanded this was what further embittered me the chairman against the harlem leadership how could i be thrust into a position of clashing with the harlem leadership as the chairman of a writers club and at the same time be a functioning part of the harlem policymaking level on page  of my book i explicitly describe the clash between the writers club and the harlem leadership on page  i write our ideas on the matter of integration were not too clearcut or definitive we were certainly not against integration of the negro in the arts but at the time it struck us that since negroes had no flourishing ethnic arts institutions    pursuing this integration theme was like launching a campaign with no thought of building a starting base this was the attitude that i and others had about integration which was definitely a farcry from black nationalism it would certainly be asking mayfield too much to read my book carefully because he has clearly stated he doesnt like the book that is his privilege because it wasnt written for mayfield and his friends to like contrary to him i have never tried to make the younger generation believe that i was always antiwhite or antiintegration i was neither until my experiences in the communist party made me critical of whites as assumed leaders of blacks and progressively doubtful of many of the claims for racial integration eighteen years after his broad way debut mayfield is still lost in the stars concerning the political and cultural implications of the communist leftwing this is because he was never a true rankandfiler who had to struggle his way up from the ranks as an unknown he came into the harlem movement with the prestige of a broadway role in a hit musical play and functioned as a minor celebrity with all the privileges which that entailed for a negro actor in  this was a signal achievement and mayfield in  still views the political and cultural scene from that remembered vantage point it is very natural for him to leap to the defense of his cultural and political trend of thinking writing etc for i am critically attacking a political and cultural trend even though my method and tone takes on a somewhat personal character however julian mayfield should remember that the communists themselves are the most practiced masters of this type of cultural and political polemic they inflicted it on me for a spell on several occasions and i waited a long time for the day when i would be able to return the critical thrust on the same terms and i repeat it was not meant to be liked or agreed with by mayfield or anyone else i would also advise julian mayfield that it is to my credit that i kept the personal animus down to its barest minimum by keeping myself out of the critique as much as possible what i personally did or didnt do is not of much importance in  however what is important is what i saw understood and objectively experienced it was my duty and responsibility as a social critic to put it down on paper for posterity finally the basic deficiency in julian mayfields defensive challenge to my book in which little or nothing was challenged but my right to write it is one that has its roots in the crisis of the black intellectual which is my theme these black intellectuals of our generation born between the two great wars simply dont know anything and seldom even think it important to find out anything beyond what might be necessary to get a college degree in this regard mayfield ponders the question of how i came to know so much oh julian thou doth my ego proud that thou doth deign to marvel at my historical eruditionor man you know that cat mustve sho been diggin into them history tomes cause he is so historically hep he is outa sight no julian not only am i a communist party dropout who never got to be a leader on a policymaking level as you assert i was also a high school dropout and delinquent who later reformed upon discovering that if one wanted to know anything one had to read later on i learned that if one wanted to read properly one had also to learn research so i became a researcher research clarifies many questions that exist clothed in vague ambiguities like too many of our black creative intellectuals julian mayfield shows that he is not a researcher which renders him a poor analyst this intellectual deficiency causes him to miss the implications of much of my bookfor example my preoccupation with the career of claude mckay and his communist connections claude mckay himself was critical of people and their communist connections for me to review the times of claude mckay and his contemporaries in the light of their communist connections is not the same thing as putting them on a crap list but represents an attempt at an historical method of literary and social criticism the fact that mayfield persists in thinking this way indicates that in his chosen disciplinethe novelhe can hardly be expected to rise above the ordinary because novelwriting on a higher level is also a form of social criticism but then one has to remember that mayfield is also an actor of some note and i think the acting impulse is strongest with him many black actors have difficulty in drawing the proper line between social reality and the world behind the footlights 
anguish
by addison gayle jr
e just wanted to  march to show our respect said renee  thats all we didnt want no violence we just wanted to march    because he was a great leader she would remember this day april  as the longest of her life earlier she had attended a rally called to protest the racist slurs of a professor at city college she had implored her fellow students to besiege the members of the state legislature with letters in an attempt to save seeka college program for young students from the ghetto what that professor said about us you know it really dont count i mean he aint that important but them legislators up there in albany if they dont appropriate some money for this program    well you know like we in trouble she had remained at the college after classes to ask nonseek students to join in her protest much later she had attended a concert of africanamerican dance and music here she heard the announcement the girl on the stage stopped dancing and she mumbled something but she had such a thick accent you know that we couldnt understand her then somebody ran into the auditorium and told us that dr_king was dead i didnt believe it    no i still dont they left the auditorium in the middle of the concert joining hands with almost  other students black and white renee marched down convent avenue to th street where a worried john lindsay pleaded with the students to halt we stopped said renee but other people they had followed us you know came along with us and then they started this the this was sporadic looting rock throwing and the hurling of crudelymade molotov cocktails two men their arms bulging with loot from a nearby mens store rushed past unseen by members of the tactical police force who stood fourabreast across the street from the baby grand night club as smoke darkened the sky in the vicinity of lenox avenue fire engines screamed past th street now barricaded by police vehicles en route to th street renee shook her head she was shocked and confused and a stare of disbelief prevailed in her young eyes now and then the revolving lights of the police vehicles accented the deep lines of her ovalshaped black face he didnt approve of violence she mumbled and it aint right to do this there was something pathetic in her words a sadness in her hurried statements a look of confusion in her oncebright eyes that told of the tragedy of the moment in a way that no statement from civil_rights leaders no pious declaration from public officials no in memoriam from gifted writers ever could martin_luther_king jr had not been her hero a child of the black_power revolution her heroes were stokely carmichael malcolm_x and leroi jones such men articulated her grievances in a way that dr_king had not true enough she could be momentarily swayed by his eloquence and was subject to moments of ecstasy in anticipation of actual contact with him yet his sonorous tones his calculated delivery of parethetical constructions his ofttimes thunderous miltonic inversions were the machinery of that evangelical past which she now disparaged hers was the world of camus of fanon of malraux and martin_luther_king jr seemed antithetical to all that that world symbolized so it was with most of her fellow students they stood together huddled in a small circle as if seeking protection from whatever danger manmade or otherwise lay concealed in the semidarkness of this frightful night they were young men and women for whom martin_luther_king jr had symbolized not the success of the future but instead the failure of the past previously they had denounced him in the most vitriolic terms quoted words from the autobiography of malcolm_x to refute his philosophy and spoken cynically though kindly of his proposed poor peoples march on washington only their elders had truly kept the faith they too came to the street comers some were drawn by the excitement generated by the events of the day others dazed benumbed sought solace in the company of those whose misery was akin to their own still others weaving between the groups of people made their way to the many churches in which harlem abounds yet they were united in one common endeavor the old and the young those who had kept the faith and those who had renounced all faith attempting to hold on to some small part of that vision which had been dr_kings most important asset the old had believed passionately fervently even to the point of idolizing the man who articulated the dream but the young had believed also their pressent militancy not withstanding the dream of martin luther  king jr was more than the dream of their fathers and no matter the disclamees they spoke the postures they assumed the vehemence with which they rejected the american society the vision of an america free of prejudice intolerance and injustice was also theirs and now tonight on this most terrible of nigthts dr_kings importance was finally recognized the most sincere and eloquent spokesman of their cause was deadassassinated by a white man thats it for me a neatly dressed young man remarked in passing they do something like that to a man like king  a man like king why one of the students asked her eyes red why him he didnt like no violence murmured renee almost incoherent and they killed him anyway she began to cry for the first time she could no longer not believe reality was too powerful once begun the tears a long time in coming rushed from her eyes as if propelled by a mechanical pump she stared at the top of a tenement building a few blocks away we just wanted to show our respect you know to show our respect because he was a great leader    another student broke the circle of silence to echo her words yes a great leader she did not hear she stood buddhalike seeing and yet not seeing her eyes fixed upon the top of the building all too soon the long day had come to an end 
sorry to discomfort you chauncey warringham hildredth iii esq
we know how distasteful it is for you to be reminded that most americans who resemble you are secondclass citizens we know you are the exception after all your parents were professional people who brought you up in a stable middleclass neighborhood you were integrated from elementary school through university and you are the only negro holding down a job like yours in a white firm yes we understand and we sincerely regret embarrassing you with all these demonstrations and freedom songs and sitins and boycotts we are sorry that because you look like us white people tend to lump you together with us however we ask you to endure the painful situation out of charity for those not so fortunate as you we recognize that this might not appeal to you especially but we feel that our concerted efforts to attain genuine freedom of opportunity and movement for all americans now are in the national interest ultimately we believe that a truly free america is an america of unsurpassable strength it is even possible that your children will be the immediate beneficiaries since they have a better education than most and are best qualified to accept the jobs which civil_rights pressures are opening up so have patience mr chauncey warringham hildredth iii the battle you are watching with such great aloofness sir is really your own
