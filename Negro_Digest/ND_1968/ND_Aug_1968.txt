new needs of  f i £ black people define in  ii r large measure the new  responsibilities of black leadership because of the success rather than failure of the civil_rights movement and because of socioeconomic changes a new set of priorities has been given to the many needs of black people the new priorities are generally agreed to be those of furthering the political and economic empowerment of black people the new responsibility of black leadership is thus to implement this empowerment some of the more successful leaders in another context have reminded us that political power flows from the barrel of a gun likewise and in a related matter economic power flows from the use of the dollar in both cases however the ultimate power resides in the man behind the gun or the dollar and the force that guides the man is his ideology from the premise that the most fundamental needs of black people are for economic and political power the major thesis of this discussion is that the empowerment of black people has needs of its own the foremost of which is the need for a compatible ideology ideology refers to the interrelated philosophies ideas and assumptions which guide thoughts shape attitudes and thereby underlie actions both groups and members of groups possess either conscious or unconscious ideologies some of which become dominant thus it is difficult to consider the struggle for black empowerment without also considering the dominant ideologies among black people although black people have achieved unity on many specific issues an ideological dualism has existed in black thought since the s this dualism has since then divided black people into two schools of thought polarized around the ideologies of assimilation versus black nationalism the confrontation today between the advocates of black and white together and the supporters of black_power is but the latest stage of this ideological dualism assimilation refers to the process whereby minorities are eventually absorbed into the majority group assimilationist ideologies among black people have been dominated by the pursuit of absorption into the majority as an end in itself minor themes in this ideology have advocated the dispersal of black communities and people the insistence upon a colorblind and individualistic approach to group relations and a deep and abiding faith in the goodwill of the better elements of the majority group on the other hand nationalism in the general case refers to shared group identity or consciousness of kind purposely expressed in institutional or cultural terms minority group nationalism in pluralistic societies such as the united states may take as its prime concern the affairs of the nationality group itself and may or may not seek to establish an independent nationstate more specifically ideologies of black nationalism have traditionally involved the efforts and desires of black people to control their own affairs maintain group cohesion define their own identities and to appreciate and develop their own cultural forms rather than absorption black nationalism has stressed coexistence with the majority and other minorities its most common form of expression has been in black communal and educational institutions thus black nationalist ideologies contrary to assimilationist ideologies have viewed the preservation of the black community as an end in itself the ideologies of assimilation have received considerable attention but serious literature on black nationalism is mixed in quality and lacking in quantity the tendency both in popular and academic literature has been to concentrate almost exclusively on a very narrow range of nationalistic thought devoted primarily to marcus garvey in the s and to the nation of islam after world war ii these two manifestations while important represent a very small segment of a much older larger and broader tradition garvey did not bring black nationalism to the united states it was here waiting for someone exactly like him garvey simply organized a long existing reservoir of black nationalist sentiment in a distinctive manner much the same holds true of the nation of islam to clarify the point of this discussion let it be noted that the general phenomenon of black nationalism discussed here is nationalism with a small n both ideologies of assimilation and of black nationalism have shared a concern for achieving desegregation and the removal of externally imposed constraints upon black people and both have from time to time shared some of the more specific interests of the other but the advocates of assimilation have traditionally displayed more ambivalent attitudes in conflicts between black and nonblack interests black nationalist ideologies on the other hand have historically displayed much less of this type of ambivalence and instead have been more ambivalent about whether or not to remain in the united states within each of the two major historical streams in black thought the respective ideologies have existed in many variants and have been applied to different usages and ends thus allegiances have changed with the issues and conditions of the time but throughout the broad outlines of the duality have remained most important the dominant position within the ideological dualism has shifted back and forth throughout history generally shifts in the dominant position have followed either major historical or sociological changes in the conditions of black people it is difficult to locate the historical ideological positions of black people as a whole but an approximation of the dominant ideology during different periods of the struggle can be found in the writings and statements of black leaders and intellectuals assimilationist ideologies dominated during the colonial period during the war of independence black people as in all wars hoped that their support of and service in the american revolutionary effort would bring the rewards of full citizenship rights and as in the cases of all wars fought by the united states all of which black people served in and supported these hopes were never realized wars however are great stimulators and innovators men are mobilized organized and gain wider perspectives therefore as black people came to recognize that the slogans of freedom and democracy excluded them they turned to themselves and began to develop nationalistic ideologies thus it was in the s that black people began to create black institutions and associations on a nationwide scale by the s black nationalist ideologies had become dominant the civil war and reconstruction witnessed the return to dominance of assimilationist thinking as emancipation and reconstruction gave black people the promise of freedom and full citizenship rights the promises were broken and reconstruction was shortlived but during this brief period black people secured a socioeconomic beachhead and in doing so released nationalistic social forces for this period also marked the beginning of the rise of a new black middle class and the founding of many black colleges businesses and communal institutions thus even though the ideology of assimilation dominated black thinking during the reconstruction period the sociological forces at work beneath the surface were nationalistic and thus the end of reconstruction was rather quickly followed by a return to dominance of nationalistic ideologies the unleashing of the ku klux klan in the south and the rise of the klan mentality all over the country affected black people of both ideological camps the dominant leadership bore the brunt of the attacks and chose to take a position of eschewing civil and political rights in favor of economic development as a result the dominant black leadership in the postreconstruction period came to be both nationalistic and accommodative the rationale was that political and civil_rights would follow economic growth but by the turn of the century such a position proved to be untenable since without legal rights or political power black economic interests were attacked at will and often violently destroyed it was in such a setting that the modern civil_rights organizations first appeared in the first decade of the th century as a minority challenge to the accommodative tendencies of the dominant leadership the appearance of the civil_rights leadership represented a conflict that beqan as a difference of strategy but soon the conflict expanded along the lines of the traditional ideological dualism of assimilation versus nationalism this period from the s to the s is vital to the understanding of todays ideological conflicts these decades opened an important era in the history of black people an era that is drawing to a close today these decades witnessed a leadership conflict that led to the rise to dominance of the civil_rights organizations much though not all of the leadership conflict raged within the black middle class the assimilationist side was represented by the civil_rights leadership which in its early days was considered an overly militant minority within the black community the civil_rights leaders were able to put together a coalition of black intellectuals who opposed the accommodationist policy of the dominant leadership black businessmen who were losing their white customers and the old black middle class which had achieved a degree of integration on the other side ranged the supporters of the dominant leadership which was nationalistic and had its locus at tuskegee these supporters included members of the new middle class whose livelihood was based exclusively on a black market and black political and educational figures whose interests favored black constituencies the undoing of the postreconstruction dominant leadership was its accommodative policy in regard to civil and political rights the civil_rights leadership used this weakness very effectively to appeal to the uncommitted and the confused the course of history was on the side of the civil_rights leadership black people came to be disenfranchised and segregation became recodified the needs of black people grew ever more clearly to be those which the dominant  leadership believed to be too radical to publicly advocate the needs were those of full civil and political rights thus the ascendancy of the civil_rights leadership to the dominant position was inevitable because this leadership recognized the more relevant needs of the time it had the courage to challenge the dominant leadership and it acted quickly and professionally to organize and institutionalize civil_rights sentiment and with the ascendancy of the civil_rights leadership came the ascendancy of the ideologies of assimilation the civil_rights leadership has met its responsibilities of fulfilling the need of black people for a reaffirmation of their citizenship rights and it is because of the success rather than failure of the civil_rights leadership that black people have today again given the first priorities to furthering black political and economic power and development for with rights won power can be developed economic and political development are two of the classic themes in black thought both intellectually and intuitively black people have always realized that economic and political power are the ultimate powers in american societywith an edge given to economic power for this reason many black people today look to the civil_rights organizations for leadership in these areas however while the civil_rights leaders can and even must assist black political and economic development they are neither structually nor ideologically equipped to provide direct leadership in these areas the organizations which provide the structural base for the civil_rights leadership are designed for and specialize in the vitally important areas of the elimination of discrimination legal aid and defense social welfare services voter registration and a wide range of other important services but because of its specialization the structural base of the civil_rights leadership does not lend itself to developing constructing and managing those black institutions that are needed for creating jobs generating wealth organizing and educating voters and providing the independent centers of strength necessary for empowering black people the dominant black leadership for implementing black political and economic power must come from elsewhere from other structures and from a different ideological orientation one example must suffice to illustrate the incompatibility of the assimilationist ideologies with the new needs and priorities of black people an exceedingly clear statement of this incompatibility comes from a book published last year by one of the foremost national civil_rights leaders speaking of housing programs he argued both rehabilitation and some new building in predominantly negro areas is immediately needed to alleviate inhuman conditions but this should be done without foreclosing possibilities of later integration emv u  added the implied assumption of the necessity for integration for its own sake strikes to the heart of the contradiction between assimilationist ideologies and black_power development assimilationist ideologies attack the very foundation of black_power the black community this same leader goes on to clarify his point and remove any doubt about his true meaning the new and rehabilitated housing in ghetto areas should be temporary constructed for a relatively shortterm period of fifteen to twenty years units should be built with a plan to tear them down at the end of that period as housing integration is advanced aside from the question of the quality and the attractiveness of temporary housing not to mention the fact that black people have had experience with temporary housing before there remains the fact that housing is one of the most fundamental internal affairs and also the fact that for black people internal affairs are power affairs experience has shown that too few members of the majority group accept the offer of integration as posing a threat to the black political base but a more serious and immediate threat to black_power shows itself in a more subtle form many black civic and religious groups are sponsoring and controlling middle and lowincome housing developments but outside interests are being allowedpartly by default but also by invitationto come in the back door and economically exploit and control the black economic market created by the black housing development such invitations are a direct immediate and harmful consequence of assimilationist ideologies a leadership whose ideologies lead it to think in terms of literally tearing down black communities for the sake of integration and whose actionswhatever the intent threaten the political and economic base of the black community is not the leadership to occupy the dominant position the purpose here is not to condemn the past or the present efforts of the civil_rights leadership for indeed this leadership deserves praise for its invaluable contributions to the struggle neither is it implied that there is no longer a role for the civil_rights organizations for these organizations are centers of black_power in their own right and in their area of specialization and the demands and responsibilities upon them in the future will be even greater yet it was less than two years ago that stokely carmichael said black_power out loud and at the mere mention of the slogan a groundswell of black consciousness surfaced and clearly indicated that an old era was giving way to a new one as floyd mckissick noted at that time  will go down in history as the year negroes became black people the classical ideological dualism in black thought has again brought black people to a major internal confrontation and into a period of transition and here it is well to note the wisdoms of what the civil_rights leaders themselves are fond of saying nothing is so powerful as an idea whose time has come the reemergence of black nationalist ideologies was inevitable because a nationalist approach to life in the united states is not only desirable but also practical american society has always been one in which groups have coexisted rather than assimilated this has never been a meltingpot society at least one of the themes in black thought has always tacitly recognized this it has taken the descendants of the immigrants longer to recognize the meltingpot myth but there are everincreasing indications that their third and fourth generations are becoming more nationalistic themselves intellectually black nationalism addresses itself to the cold and hard thinking and analysis necessary for economic and political development it recognizes the harsh realities facing an oppressed people and seeks to come to grips with them directly rather than by seeking to solve them by absorption into a hostile majority intellectually black nationalism looks to group rather than individual power and power in this society is a group enterprise whether the groups are racial or based upon socioeconomic class black leadership has been a sincere leadership but the present dominant leadership has made intellectual mistakes at the turn of the century the dominant leadership which was nationalistic made the intellectual mistake of assuming that black people could enjoy power without rights the dominant civil_rights leadership today seems to have made the mistake of assuming that rights in themselves are sufficient for reaping the fruits of power if todays civil_rights leadership knows better and most likely it does it has failed to enlighten many of its ideological followers both rights and power are always needed and in a society in which power is the quid pro quo of life a minority group should seek to maximize its power for the very reason that it is a minority black nationalism is perhaps even more relevant to the needs of black people in its emotional contributions to black thought nationalism seeks to show black people intellectually why and how they should struggle together it also seeks to instill the emotional reasons for wanting to struggle together it strives to create among black people feelings of selfrespect and mutual love and esteem black nationalism labors to foster a love for black companionship an appreciation for black culture and a joy in black living it is in these emotional qualities that black nationalism contributes to the struggle some of its best moments these moments soften the bitterness and hardships of the struggle and supports a faith in the potential of the struggle these emotional aspects of black nationalism are quite serious and represent one of its strongest forces of internal cohesion this warm emotional quality gives the particular form of nationalism that has evolved among black people a very positive character black nationalism is today a minor but growing sentiment among black people it first reappeared as a slogan then came to be recognized as a new concept and is now developing into a modern ideology that draws upon its tradition but adjusts to the present and the future black nationalism will grow ever stronger as it is given new definition and a wider base for it is one of the most intellectually and emotionally relevent ideologies present today yet the strongest argument for the inevitability of the continued rise of black nationalism is neither intellectual nor emotional this argument is simply that black nationalism is the product of social forces for black people are making socioeconomic and political progress and as black people advance the very structure of this society points to nationalism as the vehicle for further advancing black needs and interests this discussion must end as it began by noting that the new needs of black people will define the new responsibilities of black leadership therefore these responsibilities cannot be defined here except in the most general of terms the heart of this discussion is that in order for black leadership to meet its responsibilities of fulfilling the new needs and priorities that leadership must bring forth a new and compatible dominant ideology the parting suggestionand it is only a suggestion since we have not yet discovered absolutesis that the new ideology be in the classic tradition of black nationalism 
former lightheavyjnrrrj £ weight champ archie  vv k moore warning of communist plans to foster race hatred in the united states told the house unamerican activities committee recently that he would fight the man who calls me an uncle tom  it occurred to me that archie moore might well go on unclassified forever in the same week i read where whitey ne whitey young though considerably less handy with his fists boldly stood and told an audience of university of south carolina students that sncc and h rap brown are smalltime operators this set me thinking over possible solutions to a problem which long has puzzled soldiers of black equality in this country having recently been fired from a howard university professorship by a squad of uncle toms dr thomases if you please i quickly concluded that ways and means are now just as necessary to check and select our uncle toms as once was the case and is now to select and check our leadersif only to police the distinction between the two the first foil to confront me was of course the simple definition of an uncle tom websters intercollegiate dictionary defines this creature as one whose behavior toward whites is regarded as fawning or abjectly servile the difficulty sets in here of course in deciding at just what point a black fellows behavior is fawning or servile standards of tomism change with the times and what is radical today may fall tomorrow within the concept of baldfaced tomism it behooves each one of us to watch our steps and periodically check ourselves booker t washington who was once regarded by most black persons as a kind of messiah is now widely condemned as an uncle tom and the dye grows faster with each decade i remember some years ago falling out with a friend because i called booker t a tom too soon i suppose but the friend has written in years since to concur with my judgment when rev martin_luther_king jr was first catapulted into recognition by the montgomery movement a sister of mine bitterly chastised me for calling rev king a moderate at a time when the press and partly therefore the public which now recognizes him as a moderate seemed then to think that militant was his true first name today uncle toms may be divided into two main categories the utilitarian and the pathological from which might be developed a more detailed typology should anyone take the trouble to try the utilitarian toms identify with militancy to varying degrees hating the white mans guts but behave as they do for what they regard or at least claim to regard as practical or realistic motives or worse for personal gain this is the type most frequently encountered these days and is perhaps in many ways by far the most cunning and dangerous indeed lest our readers grow too smug a tenable case could be made out for the theory that the mass of silent blacks who while scorning to take aggressive stands as uncle toms bow down in apathy at best at worst in cringing docility themselves comprise as heavy an anchor as active tomism in submerging the struggle for black equality the pathological uncle tom is a true believer madly in love with the white race he has identified with the aggressor as psychoanalysts say he is to say the least a very sick man and cannot be helped much by an ordinary layman we grow too technical anyway  one could just as easily quibble about the categories of body length about the exact point at which a man moves into the tall man range uncle toms too are relative and some toms naturally manage to out tom fellow toms the purpose promised in this brief essay is how to handle persons you yourself regard as uncle toms my rule of thumb is when interacting with a tom to keep my respectful distance though some of my best friends are toms and there are nice toms and impudent toms still a man has to be discriminating in his associates people are likely to link you with them despite a  supreme court ruling to the contrary and yet a word about some tactics for using uncle tomsnever mind the interesting but less important means of tantalizing them our aim is to put toms to work for the black cause bringing their forces in a roundabout way to our side not to thicken the wall now standing between us  granted that some toms are too far gone to be retrieved for the purposes i am about to propose and well do i know that it is a bit too hard to try to throw ones love about to everybody still there is i think a role for everybody to play hence the need to select our uncle toms or to put up some from our own ranks with strong enough stomachs to play the part then by some sort of remote control get them together with us at least maintain communication about their activities in relation to our own for instance we could agree that we will call a fellow and his project tomish before the press while he calls us extremist then we could retreat home and pour drinks in wait for his grant finally when once he receives his grant for a million dollars say he can give us about  or so for apparatus guns gasoline science and mechanics books or whatever is your pleasure for our own program that way toms who plead devotion to the black cause in america could indicate to us whose side they are really on meanwhile black militants who face it are not known for their wealth could acquire much needed operating capital presently some unthinking black  radicals some wearing processed hair religiously reject the idea of white financial support they seem to lose sight of the fact that money is green our fear is lest it should slowly turn red we must guard against being bought by money from any sourcewhite black or polka dottelling our donors that money given must come without tight strings i recognize the great inclination for subtle even unconscious submission to financial sources as well as the liability to dependence on the finances issued but this we must begin to overcome in any case white wouldbe controllers of black movements can entrap us no less by giving their money as some do now to black front sources who in turn may control our policies if we can be purchased by thick green this is not to mention the fact that the amount of money available in black sources at this time is very meager even black purses with perceptible bulges are too tightlipped to be opened very wide anyway bail money which black militants increasingly appear to need by the bale could be secretly paid by undercover militants posing as uncle toms and commendably this has already become a practice one black militant claims that his apparent passion for white women is really a pursuit on his part of one of them to take as a wife and place on the street to raise money and provide a social service for black militant brothers way out to be sure but how can we know that he is not on the level we cant not in the beginning but this is no need for unnecessary alarm we cannot be sure that the fiery black militant who recently joined our committee with a stunning african wardrobe an arabic name and the bushiest hair of all is not working for the man does your organizations authority on guerilla warfare with the plan to sock it to this country plan to turn your group in on a conspiracy charge after a couple of friendly conversations is a member of the fbi on your planning board could be this brings to mind another point a couple of years ago when my the black anglo saxons was published and i began to receive invitations to speak before audiences of strangers i was frequently a victim of this kind of misconception indeed many of my less educated black brethren seemed to feel threatened egowise and confused by the fact that i a howard professor identified with the black masses which unknown to them i was a part of by birth and upbringing you must be a fake one of them might shout during a postlecture exchange in the questionanswer period if you said that around howard you wouldnt be there long well i had been saying those things and more than ever since  although governmental interference was later to help bring about my removal for such views still in the minds of the average black radical all howard professors were undeniably uncle toms other militants hold this view of government employees others of black policemen and detectives yet when the fbi infiltrated the kkk the kkk in turn infiltrated the fbi we need to infiltrate the fbi to have some idea of the nature of their knowledge and infiltration of us are we not as sophisticated as the klan all of this is not to deride afro hairdos and abus both of which i possess but my point is that any police force worth its salt contains a body of plain clothesmen there is no need for whites to be able to look at us and tell what we think by the way we dress we need some secretary in the pentagon wearing a blond wig and well known as a trusted tomor is it sally so that an order from lbj to send troops to detroit could be mistyped misplaced or delayed ever so slightly to give the brothers a bit more time the supply of spiesonce armageddon arrivesmust come from the ranks of those who somehow have retained trustworthy relations and the ability to communicate with otherwise wary white enemies to shut off all contacts is to sever a lethal cord of eventual subversion the more we get together in a spatial separation desirable as that is the more subject  we areunless there are those lurking as enemies withinto fall victim to air raids and bombings in an allout war not only could the whites drop an atom bomb on us we would be even by land left vulnerable to a noose of white troops surrounding and decimating us the advantages of hanging on to some inside positions though again i must be brief for fear of revealing too much was apparent when a few years back the lights went out in the new york area leaving a city helpless and stranded in the darkness of suspended elevators and blackedout streets authorities sought vainly for an explanation some going so far as to suggest that god did it undoubtedly some colored night watchman pulled that switch or so he could have all of the foregoing is representative of our new and untapped potential for togetherness power a far far preferable replacement for the present smokescreen of unity or oneness there isrepeata role for everyone to play just as on a football field there are quarterbacks fullbacks halfbacks guards and tackles the same principle holds true for any collective endeavor and in the words of karl marx the revolutionary communist theoretician e very little bit helps in a sense recently however a black radical friend of mine quoted marx to refute my proposal for corralling and yoking uncle toms claiming that marx would regard them as counterrevolutionaries who should be swiftly purged i replied that while it is true that there are similarities between russian uncle toms of yore and black uncle toms marx was not writing about us colored folks of todays world and ill fight the man who says that i am tomming to uncle toms born of africa j tf £ born of her soil her i £ rhythms her multi jy tudes i was queen of egypt and bushman peasant wife i roamed the forests of the congo and the rivers nile and zambesi i saw the travels of many an equatorial sun but most of all i was a woman a black woman in love with the black manhood of the world the mother of black children the baker of the bread however high our civilizations rose however primitive our villages in the eyes of the west however strange the pale ghost faces of those who invaded us my dedication was to him to the black man and to all things pertinent to his well being i cooked for him and bathed his feet and bore him children i laughed at his jokes and stood silent and believing when he spoke of his dreams i was proud and walked with a swaying to my hips which brought delight to his handsome black face i was straight in my stance and i looked up to him for all my needs we were a people a proud black people the rulers of our own lives and when the sun was low and he sat beside the door of our home with fatigue in his eyes i danced for him and gave him much pleasure till the sun should rise again then came the marches i remember the march across the land the first of the marches we stretched out in a great line as far as the eye could see and mixed with lion howls and cheetah screams there persisted the bonerubbing bloodcrusted chainclanking of white imposed slavery my husband stumbled amidst the chains ahead of me and my pregnant sister marched behind i remember well that the only times we were allowed to stop beneath the lashing whips while the sun was still high in the sky were on the occasions of sickness striking some person in the line we stopped on such a day one week away from the day we started marching it was to unshackle my sister from the chains her ninth month had come too soon the labor of birth had begun its timeless stroke a white slave driver threw her to the ground kicked her so hard i could hear the thud above her screams and then ordered us to leave her lying with her heaving labor alone on the earth where some kind scavenger might sink its teeth into her throat her husband cried out in anguish his leg irons dragging the ground and his wrists scarred to bleeding with his efforts to reach her he fell to his knees pleading that they leave him with her if both could not go i remember well now during sinister sleepless nights the sound of the white machete as it sung through the air and cut open his heart we marched and we died we were lashed and driven like beasts despite it all west africa awaited us the prisons on the gold coast awaited us of every  among us who lived  of us died among them my husband my brother my sister my mother my sons and one wellgrown girlchild my heart turned to a stone harder than some may ever know and through the stone of my heart the white men tried to chisel the art of sewing and broken english and how to bow and scrape and shuffle to the tune of yas suh and no suh i learned nothing and obeyed for my lifes sake the boats came i was packed like a bag of sop into the stinking hold most of my village was there inside that floating hole in the dark there was no air no toilet no place to move we lay shackled together amidst the stench of death for months on a tossing sea and we died again one after the other we mutinied and some of us fed ourselves to the sharks rather than remain slaves finally when our numbers had dwindled to onefifth our beginnings we landed in america in that great land of the free and home of the brave for me from the beginning of my american sojourn it has been the land of the greedy and the home of the slave for  years i was americas physical slave and for almost  more white america owned my mind two hundred years of my backs free labor turned swamps into fertile lands and forests into bales of cotton and cotton into northern factories and mills for  years i suffered the brainwash from white mouths which beat me into acting the servantslave i sowed my best of labor music invention and faith and i reaped the racists raping knife i was taught christianity and armed with my new faith i sought to love again for so long a time i had no other hope i put my trust in jesus and all in all i was a better christian than my white teachers i prayed and i kept the faith while i lived in the american hell i met a man a slave like me and according to the white christian law of that time i married him by jumping over a broomstick among our friends i would have liked a preacher but this was not to be allowed all my pastafrica my native language uraba kamba masia my family my friends of long beforewas lost and tom from my memory the past was gone to here and now i summoned all my courage to begin again we had four children my husband and i his love was a balm to all my pain ill never forget the day when the white mistress at the big house raped him for her own and on the morning when my oldest child was eight the white man who owned us all sold us all  each to a different place each to hell knows where they freed us lincoln sitting in his noble chair white father of all black children leaned down like god and told me i was free he told me to run gaily in freedom not noticing the white scars which marked the places where my legs had once been when i crawled out onto the world and looked at the white fathomless sea washing against and over me i saw nothing but horror despite the one or two kind white hands which reached out to help me i saw nothing but a lonesome horror but somehow through the years lonely and misused by panting white men i held on i saw many a black sister fall but i held on again in  i married he a beautiful black man dark like africa young and courageous like the african lions in my past he gave me patience and hope to run beside my ugly bitterness he gave me love and tenderness to bolster my sagging vision of the world i was able to get jobs and he could not i wore the pants because he could not i saw him shrivel up like some castoff fruit for some time you could find my husband in harlem or bedford stuyvesant or white plains lying drunk with despair and liquor in the alley behind some shambled building or sitting with a dullness in his eyes behind some southern white house or lynched perhaps in your home town hanging to a tree or burning on a stake driven into the ground you could find one of my sons on some street corner in a dorag afraid to hope and ready to kill you could find my other son sleeping beside some fabled white chick thrilled to touch her pale superhuman flesh there was a time when my daughter was raped of all that was precious and then left to cry with no one to hear there was a time when you could find me scrubbing white floors washing white clothes cooking white food and mammying white babies with a studied attention far greater than the love i was supposed to give to my own children there was a time when i watched my husband cry into his hands as his children looked to me for bread and spending change i saw his manhood beaten and denied by a country which scorned him put its big foot on his head and ground down its heel while the owner of the foot shouted nigger there must be law and order nigger always obey the law nigger i saw every last one of us sitting by and crying and biding our time while we died every hour of every day and lived on white vomit and wished to god and satan that we were white but all that has changed for us now though some of my black brothers and sisters are still in the mire that has changed for my black family and me now the fires have come to burn the white sickness the healing fires have come i will bide my time here no more its time i turned back to loving and delighting my own my patience with the centuryold system is gone now its gone away with the thudding of the years and the dripping of my lifes blood i will wish to be white no more now i will fry my hair no more bleach my face no more for the final glow of pure sweet whiteness has faded to tarnish i see who i am now and who my man is we have begged and worked in vain too long i wont lose my husband and sons and daughters again nor will they let me be lost i am a black woman and again i have found my original pride i will stand with my black man and my blackness wherever it is found to love him to give him my strength is my total reason to be again and if it means that i must rewrite my history despite those who wrote me out of it if it means i must never sleep however long the hours and if i must bleed again and suffer scorn again i will gain my freedom my black man will be free and if it means at that point in time when the white wall will not give way and we cant push without applying a final terrible fire that i must stand beside that man of mine and follow him fiercely toward the way to white and black oblivion having found the essence of myself this black woman will not turn back
the very highest   y praise is inadequate in  l paying tribute to the late dr_king the man was indeed a king among men successful and sensitive crusader resourceful and persuasive teacher courageous exemplar of nonviolence in the united states eloquent spokesman for the cause of justice freedom peace and humanistic ideals for all men a religious leader with a deep and abiding faith in and

and torn by the invidious distinctions  of class and the pernicious divisions of race these all too briefly are some of the accolades identified with martin_luther_king jr many of his accomplishments of a short  years attest to his extraordinary stature in the world chronicles of social and political relations in the united states regardless of perspective will certainly rank him as one of the most influential americans of the th century as regards especially moral issues legislation for civil_rights and social progress for the disadvantaged he exerted a farreaching and profound impact on the consciousness of the american people none of his contemporaries matched his combined efforts in all of the areas mentioned here and especially those extended for the ultimate causes of mans struggle freedom from oppression as well as to realize opportunity and fulfillment justice in the rewards and relationships of human endeavor and humanity as dignity and selfesteem as well as reason and responsibility dr_king was a studious and studied man of letters author of five books and contributor to several additional ones he has had still others written about him and his work his writing reflects penetrating insight and wide scholarship there is also the vast as yet uncounted number of essays articles speeches sermons published interviews letters and other communications of record in their own special way each skillfully appeals to the intellect the imagination and the emotion as to other credentials major american universities recognized him with both earned and honorary degrees he received awards from numerous civic agencies for his contributions to american life as orator rev king had few peers many of his speeches will long be remembered and analyzed for both content and style the most memorable perhaps is his address at the  march on washington in a rising crescendo of emotion and on the refrain i had a dream     he challenged the nation to rise up and live out its creed of equality for all men the last one in memphis as if in eerie premonition of his imminent demise gave clear expression to the belief that ultimately it is the purpose and fullness of life rather than its length and possessions which give it significance and provided the lasting measures of a man dr_king traveled widely and attracted worldwide attention throush his valiant efforts in the service of others increasingly he was being looked to as the most promising spiritual or moral leader of his time more than a great negro or american he was regarded as a great man of the world he went on to further renown after his international acclaim in  when he became the youngest man ever to win the nobel peace prize at age  unparalleled as a civil_rights leader he was one of a rare number of famous men who had the ear of presidents yet retained the common touch for reaching the masses of his people and many of goodwill of other races as well having many of the qualities of moses and gandhicourage steadfastness in the face of adversity selfless devotion to freedomhe might well have equalled their successes to the extent of winning freedom for his people if death had not come at such an early age the charisma and capacity for empathy which he had virtually would have assured this he achieved identity with the unlettered sharecropper as well as the learned scholar with the woman in the slum flat as well as in the suburban bungalow to the radical and militant he seemed mild and moderate to the forces of reaction he was radical but his commitment was crystal clear and unyielding detractors notwithstanding in his  book why we cant wait he articulated the significance of his nonviolent course and cause as the able philosopher astute tactician and ardent supporter of nonviolence in america his special blend of courage style and mastery of the technique of confrontation with his adversaries served as a vital buffer between at the extreme the forces of nihilism with its accompanying violence from blacks and those of reaction and racism with their violence from whites three brief statements from his writings help to capture the essence of his philosophy which is based on the enduring law of love that the way to humanity and community is through the creative understanding of and redemptive goodwill for ones fellowman in strength to love  he instructed we must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system and thereby to become a participant in its evil    and through nonviolent resistance we shall be able to oppose the unjust system and at the same time love the perpetrators of the system for the expected outcome his account of the montgomery bus boycott in stride toward freedom  is most revealing the aftermath of nonvio lence is the creation of the beloved community one in which friendship and understanding can prevail tragically however like the great soul gandhi rev king was victimized by the very incapa ft   a i  city of some to grasp the significance of his message about violence its brutality inhumanity irrationality and inexorably its ultimate futility the irretrievable loss of his bulletrained death in stealth and cowardice has its expected ignominy the king assassination stands as a symbol of the segregated society and its breeding of hatred racism and violence against which he so valiantly struggled if we are to find solace and sustenance amidst the void created by his murder we can look to his service commitment love and good works few men ever leave such a rich and varied legacy as has dr_kingideas ideals and values organizational efforts inspirational and worldwide interests these and more form the main part of his treasury for america indeed for the ages nonviolence and brotherhood selflessness and humility along with the other praiseworthy values recounted here will continue to be linked with his lifes work and aspirations some basic foundations of his thinking are sketched in the shortest and perhaps least known of his books the measure of a man  although they are encountered in more elaborate form in his other writings in it he expresses basic beliefs about the purpose meaning and dimensions of life its potential rests on the boundless reservoir of mental moral and material strength which lies within the grasp of each unique human personality from this man develops the capacity to triumph with positive virtues and values in the fact of apparent weakness and even in defeat perhaps his experience and eventual disengagement in the albany georgia protests of  and in his chicago efforts of  to launch and sustain the movement in the north are cases in point by drawing from the reservoir hope can be retained under conditions of despair love can be evoked in the face of hate he makes it clear that when hate and despair prevail men fall victim to frustration disillusionment alienation or to an even more pathetic conditionthat of violence and destruction the full life then is one in which there is a combination of positive virtues and values with strong commitment and action that results in the reconciliation of high order principles with practice of idealistic rhetoric with reality only two of dr_kings organizational efforts are mentioned although he made contributions to others and his name is linked indelibly with organized demonstrations and campaigns for social change in cities of the north as well as the  south considering their initiative timing import and successes dr_kings work with the montgomery improvement association founded in  and the southern christian leadership conference founded in  can be consid   ered a noteworthy monument under his leadership as president the former provided the coordination and support for the successful bus boycott in that city see stride toward freedom  this was an important victory because it built solidarity among the negro community led to a change in the laws of segregation and proved the efficacy of the boycott as an instrument of progress in the social economic and political life of negroes his prominence eventually transferred to the southern christian leadership conference of which he was also the first president and brought it to the forefront among the major civil_rights groups especially in the south it attacked the problems of discrimination and injustice through voter registration basic and citizenship education selfhelp programs of economic and political action and other means of nonviolent protest in summary several perspectives gleaned from his writings are instructive as suggested by the following develop a full measure of spiritual power and moral leadership for that is the path to virtue be right and resolute use reason and restraint in the struggle for freedom for these noble means carry dignity consistent with such a worthy end strive for harmony and unity in the complex and interdependent relations that make up the human condition for the whole part of man and society and must work in concert in order to realize their full potential achieve both material and spiritual sustenance in the pursuit of love and the values that sustain us in a healthy viable mental and physical state of wellbeing for that is required in developing the dimensionslength breadth and heightof the complete life these are but few of the goals and guides to be drawn from the king legacy they are extensions of his contributions in making his precepts and examples livable and believable all exerted an obvious and pervasive influence in his own life and beliefs these and other teachings he has offered to us they have been implanted in the national body politic as his challenges have been on the national conscience but like all teachings and challenges it is up to the taught to learn and use them up to the challenged to make them opportunities and benefit from them finally the insight and prophetic quality of much that dr_king expressed should serve us the living in shaping the future of life in america we have reached the crossroads of our journey as a society condoning segregation injustice and racism those marked the other way are routes leading to violence destruction and inhumanity those marked the king way are upgrading routes leading to nonviolence construction and humanity in the title of his  book he posed the question which each of us must answer in some way since our own destiny will be touched by the collective answer that is finally given where do we go from here chaos or community if the answer is community dr_king in paying the supreme sacrifice to gain for blacks freedom from an environment impoverished by white oppression and for whites freedom from an environment impoverished by their own hypocrisy and racism will not have died in vain the work of martin_luther_king jr was for the good of america and mankind taken away in the vibrant fullness of manhood by his loss both america and mankind are the less his death diminishes us all because we too are involved in the work of america and mankind yet we the living can be working still we must be for the system the way of lifethe hatewhich produced the murderer holds us all in peril dr_king offered an alternative it is in his path by his creed through lovethat we shall be free at last free at last    that we shall overcome

leo proudhammer age  and his older brother caleb had just watched their parents dance merrily to a calypso it had been a rare occasion in which the proudhammer parenis transcended their sorrow the terms of their existence in americaand discovered briefly the joy that comes with owning ones own life they were smiling writes james baldwin in tell me how long the trains been gone dial press  an indescribable smile moments later daddy proudhammer in the process of clicking the radio dial away from the news is  asked by his eldest son now dont you want to know whats happening in the world to which his father responds no    aint no white boy living can tell me whats happening in the world not before they find out whats happening on my job it is not to be sure the novels most dramatic or exciting scenebut it is nonetheless illustrative of the powerful symbolism and imagery at work throughout this story about one black mans struggle to overcome the definition of himself handed down by his white countrymen which he accomplishes fairly quickly and his longer more difficult struggle to accept that self which rests beneath the mask of color and to discover finally something actual about the human condition one is not aware of a black actor on the american scene with as great a depth as the novels hero actor leo proudhammer however one is aware of james baldwin who because his is the voice of an unusually civilized mind in this primitive land may indeed be our greatest writer and who without question has written the most important novel of this crucial decade in american history it is precisely that american historythe ugly facts which one yet seeks to deny and which moreover prove difficult to comprehend when revealedthat must be accepted if one is to consider the life of leo proudhammer and not as his story unfolds feel menaced by its utterly painful comments upon ones own life enter the novel by way of suffering with proudhammer a heart attack enter sailing as it were on the recognizable waves of baldwins prose into the pain of an actor made famous rich and notorious because he cast himself into a love role rather than remain our kind of actorcast by directors one despises into roles one hates proudhammer takes us back to the harlem of his boyhood where we discover him to be an avid listener a sensitive youth who very early makes the allimportant connection between better acting and wisdom he learns early the art of allowing others that most desperate of needs the belief that they are winning and perceives that what is routinely dismissed as good luck is nothing other than the product of ones own cunning all of which provides him with vision beyond the garment center that claimed his father and at first appears to have invested in him an unshakeable confidence but which upon further examination turns out to be nothing more than temerity enough to carry him from the inherited degradation of harlem to a selfimposed romantic degradation in the village that further examination occurs when key actor proudhammer hardly challenged by harlem or the village attends with his white friend barbara an uptown theatrical party where he encounters a better actor than himself the party as an event in literature might prove as devastating to any number of readers as it could have been in the life of leo proudhammer on the stage of life in a very real sense for the first time proudhammerat the mercy of a white directoris dragged to the bottomless sea of his own bitterness it is the moment in which he makes that much avoided but gravely essential discovery that he too is vulnerable can be had can in fact drown and is without means of securing his life raft except by paying that historic price which price is coming to terms with the rage that is his own rage that    pretended to sleep but it never slept the merest touch of a feather was enough to bring it howling roaring out it had no sight no measure no precision and no justice and it was my master still as baldwin has written elsewhere how painful it is to repeat these words that haunted the reviewer throughout his foolish years the question of color operates to hide the graver questions of the self proudhammer survives his rage and one comes upon him a hungry cat still years and much hard work away from fame standing on an empty stage in an empty theater at an actors workshop in new jersey i looked out at the dark spooky theatervery spooky now with the rain roaringand wondered if my destiny could be involved in such a place but destinies as i was beginning to discover are strangeand must be being so mysteriously hung up with desire for i desired i realized one dayif these bones could liveto stand here before those living with whom i would fill this dusty void and hear them bearing witness as i now heard the sound of the rain i had never before thought of my desire as a reality involving others neither had i thought of others as needing my desire but i now for the first time in that dusty barn suspected that this coupling defined ones destiny and that on this coupling depended the mysterious life of the world i was young perhaps it is hard now to credit still less to sound the depth of my bewilderment i merely suspected in the chilling height the dusty roaring darkness the presence of others each of whom was myself but these others could not know it and neither could i unless i was able being filled by them to fill this theater with our lives this was perhaps my highest possibility of the act of love in this era of lovelessness out of the heart and guts of james baldwin comes a rejoicingly beautiful novel that seeks not to appease any taxpayer in this republic black or white who victimized by selfestrangement would honor only that work which legitimizes ones own curious version of the american fantasy or ones own fantasylike version of the american reality to experience this novel really is to experience proudhammers love which is perhaps asking a little much of the same public that held in contempt rufus from another country and one can already hear the voices shouting proudhanvner alas as though one could have as it were the dune without a mighty wind one might for a starter find proudhammer unlovable because of his long meaningful relationship with a white woman seeking solace in the illusion that in denying proudhammers history one escapes ones own so long however as one persists in believing that the tragedy in which these  or  or  million nobody really knows were conceived way back there on the plantation can be attributed to pigmentation or genes rather than the absence of love one remains albeit heterosexual a perverted lover of the opposite race which brings one to a consideration of bisexual proudhammers homosexual relationships conjuring in the american imagination as indeed nigger pot god and all else that one has not understood has conjured images of a hell more painful more deadly and more eternal than that which one has accepted as ones life sentence on this planet my own instinct asserts proudhammer as to the male relation is that men who are far more helpless than women because far less singlemindedneed each other as comrades need each other for correction need each other for tears and ribaldry need each other as models need each other indeed in sum in order to be able to love women one is not certain what in fact a homosexual is but one is afraid that american men are all finally faggots forbidden to touch each other because the very idea of loving each other imposes upon ones imagination an experience more incomprehensible more guilty and more heartless than the sad affairs through which one so recklessly seeks that much heralded and elusive quality called manhood if in fact the acceptance of rufus required as one suspects coming to terms with americas base cruelty the acceptance of proudhammer requires of one a face with which to confront the source of that cruelty americas profound stupidity for unlike rufus who was unable to withstand this land where one is hardly out of grammar school before plotting ones own death proudhammer outdistances the national mediocrityi had had it among all these deadly and dangerous people who made their own lives and all the lives they touched so flat and stale and joyless    my countrymen impressed me simply as being on the whole the emptiest and most unattractive people in the world it seemed a great waste of ones only lifetime to be condemned to their chattering vicious pathetic hysterically dishonest company there were other things to do other people to see there was another way to live and it is in his toughness where insight is seemingly endless that one might find ones own dreaded weakness the man who some time ago insisted upon his right to criticize america perpetually because he loves her seems to understand along with so few others that  years is but a fraction of history a moment in mans evolution and some  years ago one is reminded a system prevailed in this land that must be calledas no man can denybarbaric men politicians with no more vision than those of ones own day in the middle of that tragic era assured themselves in the act of writing a beautiful document that despite the inhuman institution to which they committed their lives they could in social terms salvage their humanity they died indeed as they lived fools and their descendentsblack and white liberal and conservative nationalists and integrationists bigots and paternalists revolutionaries and uncle toms cling desperately and with much timidity to the myth of their creation for not very many people in america have begun to understand as james baldwin so eloquently stated in at least two essays everybodys protest novel  many thousands gone  included in the collection notes of a native son that the reality of man as a social being is not his only reality one might wish in the confusion of a day in which writersmen who do not for one moment imagine themselves able to lead another to the promised landare expected to perform the perfectly awful rituals of the popularity contest that baldwin had plotted a novel in which the recipe out of the mess read as clearly as reads the back of a cake box but the mess which is precisely ones own life has ever been more complex than ones most daring wish and it is in just such a wish that one misses the point of the novel the pain of the novelist that he must write out of his experience and moreover in that same wish one misses as baldwin has reminded us the point of oneself that one can only face in others that which one faces in ones self james baldwin in tell me how long the trains been gone explored that phenomenon one thinks oneself incapable of as reflected in the vain attempts to dismiss it as irrelevant yet not even the extraordinary delusion rampant in america has convinced any among her inhabitants that anything save love will spare this nation the fate that awaits any people whose sense of human life is defined by the sword the once symbolic fire has become visible can one accept this novels fury terror rage hatred and finally its love as ones own there can be one hazards only one american dream to struggle out of this nightmare perhaps it isnt after all impossible however as james baldwin remarked a few months ago ignorance is in the saddle here and we ride mankind and ignorance it must be noted is either colorless or multicolored david llorens hould retain billyboy after we take over the schools we asked why and after we heard the usual things about how long folks have been reading him and how much she enjoyed midsummer nights dream she said he was just valuable and why the devil didnt we quit questioning gods anyway we pointed out that leroi jones has said the black man is making new gods not only spiritual but economical political organizational and in every way including literatural we only wanted to know what bill shakespeare with his racist overandundertones hashad done for the black community and her answer was nothing should a people revere a literature that has done nothing for them should a people support endeavors that do not benefit them recently in negro digest dudley randall and don l lee had a similar discussion should artists support artistic endeavors that do not benefit their people and who makes that determination these are some of the questions we had while reading curling houghton mifflin  the second novel by robert boles one other possible title could have been one of dem we are disappointed when we see talented young writers engaging in meaningless discussion about how weve just got to adjust to this american situation three novels have been published this season dealing with the need to be accepted by white people or the justification for loving their women this is not only unfortunate it is unacceptable it discourages our people from reading dick and jane and up the hill to get a pail of water is not zeeley and chuch othello and up against the wall    scarlett is not vyry the flagellants arent whos afraid of virginia woolfe and we need to be engaged in making that distinction any artist can only articulate whether with pen or brush or clay etc what he is and feels and knows boles has done this he like all americans has a dream and that dream is that america adopt chelsea a nigger into its rich white family that dream is that chelsea a poor black boy replace the older white son who had once mistreated a black woman and he attempts to explain how all this is possible how allen chelseas younger brother does care about him how his father did do and would do the right thing how his fathers wife who would not allow him to call her mother will grow to love and accept him in time he takes us through chelseas endless wealth his endless love for a white woman who would you believe doesnt love him the endless abuse he suffers because they dont understand that he is just like them and finally to his ultimate justification for killing another poor black man the murder is central to the theme because chelsea does not want to kill a poor colored man but is compelled to kill if he is to continue playing the life game called white like them chelsea journeys to upper new england after his rejection which is probably final by that white woman he loves he vows never to go back to his family since they so obviously dont want him but the longer he stays the longer he has to long for his old way of life shades of the happiest slave in the world he needs a reason to call upon them question how can i get the family to be involved with me answer cause a disturbance question what should i do answer kill someone result the family came to the rescue result he can remain rich though rejected result two black men dead result an unfortunate book we are always disappointed when we see  talented young writers engaging in  meaningless discussion to justify their refusal to be free now that its written we hope mr boles will literally explore other possibilities available to him nikki giovanni  the coffee house ministry by john d perry jr published by john knox press at  is a very timely and helpful book it speaks of the christian churchs effort to come of age in our time this movement is ecumenical and integrated and is a new and effective means for the church to perform the service to mankind that it was commissioned to do by jesus christ the cogent ideas of our time must have a forum and this book explains in detail how this has been attempted by the coffee house ministry it is certainly a must for any who desire to attempt this work james e woodruff i in most of our history we get the upper side of history in american history we get the europeans who came and took the land and killed the indians and brought millions of blacks here to slavery but we dont get the story of the indians and the negroes tom haydens rebellion in newark random housevintage   gives us the underside of the newark uprising the official story is that negroes rioted against law and order looted and burned and were finally brought under control by the forces of law and order tom hayden who has been a community organizer in newark since  tells the story from the point of view of the negroes in a brief book most of which appeared previously in the  review new york review of books conditions in newark were among the worst of any large city in the country it had the nations highest percentage of bad housing the most crime per  people the heaviest per capita tax burden the highest rates of venereal disease maternal mortality and new cases of tuberculosis it was trying to squeeze out the negro population by creating a acre medical school in the ghetto the mayor refused to appoint a fully qualified negro to an educational post and tried to appoint a political crony instead the uprising was touched off by the arrest and the beating of a taxi driver by the police it began wednesday and continued into thursday young people tore open liquor and furniture stores and other people poured into them community organizers felt violence could not be halted and urged that burning of buildings be held down to save lives the burning was confined to not more than  buildings the looting had virtually stopped by friday when the state troopers and the national guard were called in if the purpose was to prevent looting they could have stationed small detachments in front of business places to protect them instead they drove through the streets in a war against the black community their actions were punitive it was then that the sniping began the police troopers and guardsmen were panicky and would rake entire buildings when a sniper fired this indiscriminate shooting killed innocent persons in their homes some of the white casualties may have also been caused by this panicky firing the police beat up black policemen reporting at the police station police troopers and guardsmen beat robbed and killed black citizens they looted and shot out the win dows of black business places thereby losing the support of the black middleclass perhaps the most important part of the book is chapter v in which hayden discusses the use of violence in the civil_rights struggle he says it is not just an overturning of law and order for law and order do not exist in the ghetto but it must be considered by civil_rights activists as a possible new strategy after the failure of politics nonviolent demonstrations and community organization to be effective it must not be sporadic as before but must be disciplined and organized and should be applied if only by paintbrush where it can cause a crisis among oppressive forces and give people the courage to demand changes and force consideration of a new system this is not a definitive account of the newark rebellion but it should be read because it tells the side which is usually untold and discusses the possibilities of violence where other means of redress have faileddudley randall 
at a time when american soldiers are fighting and dying in vietnam it is good to remind ourselves of the differences between bravery and heroism this service hardly limits the value of episodes of the revolutionary war by the recently murdered ernesto che guevara international publishers  paper but if you have been brainwashed into thinking negatively about castros cuba justify your curiosity with this service in mind bravery is simply the encountering of known risks heroism is fighting for a purpose and against the odds castro guevara and  other men did just that when they left mexico on november   on a sevenday seasick voyage in the tiny granma they were the entire cuban rebel army and they had  rifles five days after they landed at playa de las coloradas the dictator batistas soldiers and air force attacked them only  men survived then they faced over two years of marching with infected feet sleeping outdoors starving fighting superior numbered and armed forces succumbing to tropical diseases and discovering deadly traitors like eutimio guerra who accepted the shelter of castros blanket one night armed with a  and planning to kill the rebels leader his cowardice alone prevented him from pulling the trigger heroes fight for an ideal of nationhood and against an evil they can clearly define as the revolution grew che wrote no one can say exactly when in this long process the ideas became reality and we became a part of the peasantry as far as i am concerned the contact with my patients in the sierra turned a spontaneous and somewhat lyrical decision into a more serene force one of an entirely different value later he saw welleducated revolutionaries lose their touchiness and become united with the peasants they fought for and he observed that the revolution cleanses men improving and developing them as the farmer corrects the defects on a plant and brings out its best qualities he gives us fascinating portraits of castro to whom we felt tied by a bond of romantic sympathy for adventure and the thought that it would be worthwhile to meet death on a foreign beach for so pure an ideal castro lost time and money to free che from jail where mexican police and fbi and dominican dictator trujillos spies had joined to put him right before the granma was scheduled to sail leave me behind che had requested i will not forsake you castro told che who later wrote that such personal gestures by fidel towards those he loves are the key to the strong devotion created around him where a feeling of loyalty based on principle is added loyalty based on friendship making the cuban rebel army an indivisible whole these personal episodes however are scattered sparsely in the book which makes them all the more moving the bulk of the little book documents the realities of guerrilla warfare the synthesis of which from the guerrillas standpoint is constant mobility constant mistrust and constant vigilance for the enemy noted che is magnificently protected although only willing to fight at a safe distance from comfortable positions and against an opponent practically defenseless much the same way as the colonists had fought the indians in the west of the united statesjohn woodford
you have heard of books being keys to other books eg the key to finnegans wake right well this book william styrons nat turner ten black writers respond beacon press  is the key to styrons unfortunate confessions of nat turnera key yes but with this difference not a key to open a door but to lock one this book is the key that locks the white liberal up in an empty meaningless and sterile room which is his white mind and history once this door is locked suffocation is the only alternative for there are no open windows no back doors to this room as a key then this book is invaluable invaluable also for some very practical reasons first there is in the appendix the complete text of nat turners confession as recorded by thomas gray second there is a variety of information regarding the historical facts and third there is a great variety of different perspectives ie the historical psychological literary political linguistic etc on the subject of nat turner in the introductory essay john henrik clarke quotes from the historian herbert aptheker historys potency is mighty the oppressed need it for identity and inspiration oppressors for justification rationalization and legitimacy nothing illustrates this more clearly than the history of writing on the american negro people now while one cannot quibble with the profundity of this observation he cannot accept the assumption implied here that history is never based on fact that both the oppressor and the oppressed can interpret a single event differently and both be right no  cannot agree only one is right and that is the oppressed people granted history has always been on the side of the oppressor but this is because it was the oppressor who wrote it the world however is becoming wiser every day we see now that history can only be on the side of the oppressed since it is the oppressed who are seeking liberation and as we say history should liberate liberation this is true history false history or propaganda to give it its right name in the name of the oppressor attempts to oppress it strives for justification rationalization and legitimacy in order to continue oppressing to understand the past and hence the present it is essential to distinguish between these two histories for one is the history of the oppressed the other the history of the oppressor and we must close the door on the latters history and swiftly we badly need this distinction in order to read properly such statements as the one from maurice merleauponty that heads lerone bennett jrs essay collected in this volume history takes still more from those who have lost everything and gives yet more to those who have taken everything for its sweeping judgments acquit the unjust and dismiss the pleas of their victims history never confesses now merleauponty obviously means by history false history or propaganda or white history because we know our history has and does confess the injustice of the white man this very book under review right now attests to this fact in his essay mr bennett goes on to accuse styron of playing the new history game of reviving big black sambo in other words he is trying to prove that u b phillips    and stanley elkins    were right when they projected samboto bootlicking headscratching childman as a dominant plantation type page  and when styrons nat is not a sambo he is according to mr bennett a neurasthenic hamletlike white intellectual in blackface this is very accurate because when one thinks about it almost all the liberals one knows believe more in sambos and hamlets a type i never did dig than they do in for example their own wives indeed mr bennett has a good many things to say for example he shows how styron manages to change the facts of nats family life to create a proper adc slave family page  his most valuable idea however is this in his determination to reduce liberty to personal passions and history to some of dat white stuff styron ignores this evidence the facts of nats actual confession and questions nat turners credentials as a leader page  mr bennett refutes beautifully styrons silly notion that nats having killed only one person had something to do with his psychological motivation mr bennett shows convincingly that nat operated as a field general and as such did not have the time to spend killing alvin f poussiant md in his essay points out the psychological implication of styrons natwhat such a creation must say about styron himself i do not think however this essay goes as deeply as it could have gone in pointing out the similarities between styron and his creation i mean if styrons nat is sexually abnormal as mr pouissant says surely this must say something about styrons own sexual fantasy lifeie from a professional point of view vincent harding gets very close to home when he states that although nat is a preacher there is only one attempt by styron to make this known to the reader ie the book contains only one sermon when in real life nat must have made thousands and again mr harding is correct in observing that the book fails to catch any of the peculiar rhythmic and thematic strengths of this ie the sermon folk art form equally striking is the fact that the religious music of afroamericans never enters as a major structural element of the novel as one would expect if such a work had been done by an ellison a baldwin or a wright page  john o killens contribution is valuable not so much for what it says as how it says it in this essay the thin slashes of the ironists whip is laid across every inch of styrons bare back one regrets that more of the contributors did not take a more detached oblique attack on the subject matter for as would be expected there was an occasional overlap of ideas mr killens believes that styrons first mistake was  to attempt the novel    the second mistake was to pretend to tell the story from the point of view of turner and it was a colossal error one that required tremendous arrogance and naivete page  and so mr killens goes quickly to the core of assumptions surrounding the novel here are two irreconciliable moralities the slavemasters to maintain slavery blatant or benevolent at any cost the slaves to utterly destroy the slavery system by every and any means the masters ethics are always enslavement the slaves are ever liberation the liberator is the moral man page  this is the most important idea in the book there is also in this essay a long enough quote from mr arna bontemps black thunder to show that the novel is superior to styrons why didnt mr bontemps i wonder get a pulitzer prize also in terms of the language in styrons book john a williams has a lot of insight so does mike thelwell who in his essay speaks of black language as being a language of action rather than one of reflection page  and i think these two contributors are right in saying that styrons basic misunderstanding of negro language resulted in some disastrous effects in his novel the most informative essay ie apart from the historical facts which almost all the contributors shared is the one by ernest kaiser mr kaiser gives a brief bibliography of novels and plays dealing with slave uprisings then he reviews the reviews of styrons novel as would be expected white conservatives white radicals and liberals all agreed that the book was as harpers said a masterpiece loyle hairston and charles v hamiltons essays are both solidly based mr hairston accuses styron of failing to create a real nat turner because styron was a victim of moral cowardice which prevented him from seeing nat as a man as a mature member of the human family mr hamilton sees styrons book as part of what he calls white liberal rhetoric that has been going on in the writing of american history text books used in our high schools and colleges we black people should give special thanks to the people of beacon press for making possible this critical reply to such an injust book as styrons as i understand it this is a first of a series of black things that beacon press is getting together carry on cecil m brown
should we follow the s configurations of time and eternity if we were black man or jew we might reach a dark harbor even as we search for a haven if we were to follow the myths of the chosen people or those of the wretched of the earth this would lead us into the beginnings of history and the configurations which we would meet on this journey so various and changing would seem dark mirages thus in our comparison of two movements zionism and negritude we cannot in this brief comparison chase all the configurations of time or explore the symbols of a statement such as i am black and comely ah ye daughters of jerusalem we will but show how two forms cast their flickering shadows partir comme il y a des hommeshyenes et des hommes pantheres je serais un homme juif un hommehindoudecalcutta un hommedeharlemquinevotepas lhomme famine vhommeinsulte lhommetorture on pouvait in these lines from the cahier dun retour au pays natal the great poet of negritude aime cesaire totally identifies with the jew depicting a brutal situation which both the black man and the jew have suffered since man is his situation he derives a power from that situation making it vital and and dynamic for instance eugene oneill is the voice of the twentieth century claims professor hartman in a recent lecture because in many ways he is the victim of the twentieth century thus out of that situation in which the black man and the jew are victims two revitalizing forces have emergedthe singing voices of zionism and negritude which have given a new intonation a new rhythm to their own historical chaos chaos prepared me and i find the track through life and darkness seek my myth move toward it hunting grow more like draw near and know it through our path know only that we run one path muriel rukeyser that one path leads from exile to return from the diaspora to the geular from alienation to reconciliation from absence from the the path will lead back to the homeland back to the earth even as it had led them astray before but the time of a symbolic return is perhaps only known by the passing wind the days have passed we are a wandering camp brighter days before us perhaps god is angry the elders have gone their bones are far their souls wander where are their souls t  i v the passing wind the spirit that whirls the leaf knows it perhaps pygmy poem that dark night which this traditional pygmy poem evokes the anguish of the ancestors and the dispersion of their bones are all circumstances which give rise to those motifs of suffering abandonment and death which abound in some of the poetry of the zionist poets such as hayyim nahman bialik and tchernichovski and in that of many negritude poets aime  cesaire leon damas and leopold sedar senghor my memory is surrounded by blood my memory has its belt of corpses aime cesaire and in bialiks long poem the city of slaughter there is an unrelieved darkness and destruction blood spatters the walls and corpses abound behold on tree on stone on fence on mural clay the spattered blood and dried brains of the dead bialik and in the hell hole of the poem the dead seek a reason for their purgatory tumbling and stumbling wraiths they come and cower there their silence whimpers and it is their eyes which cry wherefore o lord and why bialik in this poem there is only despair dread and hopelessness but in his longer poem the dead of the wilderness so similar in many respects to cesaires cahier dun retour au pays natal bialik resurrects the dead of heroic stature here who through an apocalyptic action momentarily free themselves from a long sleep the setting for the poem is the silence and rocky desolation of a desert where symbolically the hatred of the serpent for these dead is expressed hatred instinctive and ancient runs through the shuddering body and the wilderness midnight and monsters which crept out from the dawn of creation represents the lived geography of those who lie o deep in the earth their heads sunk heavy with tangles neglected the poet imbues these dead with life and makes them rise up in revolt a song of strength and revolt has reached us and we rise    behold us we will ascend with the tempest though the lord has withdrawn his hand from us bailik after this revolt there is a purer silence in aime cesaires cahier dun retour au pays natal it is the poet who gives purpose to the desolation of the island home to which he is returning who accepts the dead landscape of his country its peoples dismal hopes who by accepting their wounds cleanses them jai longtemps erre et je revie ns vers la hideur desertee de vos plaies je viendrais a ce pays mien et je lui dirais embrassezmoi sans crainte   and as damas puts it nous avons besoin de toucher du doigt toutes les plaies qui zebrent le livree noire  through the union of the poet with the land he exalts the anguish of the people in these two long poems cahier dun retour au pays natal and the dead of the wilderness whose landscapes are elemental in their starkness and timeless in their barreness pervaded by horizontal images of despair and death the poets by the word make of anguish and suffering a unique quality in much of the poetry of zionism and negritude there runs then a sense of uniqueness wherein the sufferings of these peoples clothe them with distinctiveness and so in the bialik poem surely the people is grass the people receive pity as great as the sea compassion as wide as his peoples weakness strong as the weight of the burden leon damas gives a converse dynamism to endurance patience charm etc    and makes of these the life force an enduring quality of the black man thus by poetic conversion he can proclaim never will the white become negro for beauty is negro but this uniqueness stems from a reaction becomes positive through a counter movement when a d gordon asks this question about uniqueness it is a rhetorical one which postulates a positive and indeed many writers of zionism and of negritude inject the people with a positive quality a uniqueness which by its very nature differentiates them from others while distinguishing them it relates them to the total history of humanity the uniqueness which is  often claimed in zionism lies in the metaphysical relationship between god man and the land and that of negritude in the ontological relationship between the vital forces man and earth in both instances the earth takes on special qualities in zionism with such biblical promises as say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken isaiah chap  v    in negritude give that postulate of the vital forces which states that anything which diminishes the vital forces is bad anything which adds to it is good the exile of peoples of african descent from the homeland is a diminishing of the total force of the land of africa and by extension of the african thus the relationship of both jews and people of african descent to a homeland takes on a special significance and return to that homeland a symbolic quality the goals of many zionist thinkers though varying in degree all relate to the question of return to the land by the same token those of many thinkers who proclaim negritude relate to an ingathering on peoples existentially destroys the special concepts of the remoteness or proximity of these people to that point of land where the vital essence exists thus the ingathering the return becomes a philosophical possibility indeed at times a political necessity albert einstein puts it thus palestine will become a cultural home for all jews a refuge for the worst sulferers from oppression a field of activity for the best among us a unifying ideal and a source of spiritual help for the jews of every country    it assures the national survival of jews and the jewish culture    palestine is first and foremost    the incarnation of a reawakening sense of national solidarity it is for me beyond any shadow of doubt that in present circumstances the rebuilding of palestine is the only object which has sufficiently strong appeal to stimulate the jews to effective corporate action albert einstein about zionism speeches and letters einsteins statement can be taken as one possible definition of zionism in it he stresses the cultural collective possibilities deriving from an ingathering of the jewish people it is this cultural collective which lies at the base of many definitions of negritude leopold sedar senghor defines it thus  negritude is the whole complex of civilized valuescultural economic social and political which characterise the black peoples or more precisely the negroafrican world all these values are essentially informed by intuitive reason because this sentient reason the reason which comes to grips expresses itself emotionally through that selfsurrender that coalescence of subject and object through mythsby which i mean the archetypal images of the collective soulabove all through primordial rhythms    these primordial rhythms express the total link of man with time for the dead the ancestors are a vital continuum between the present and the past the child is an ancestor and the ancestor a child mon enfance mes agneaux est vieille comme le monde et je suis jeune comme vaurore eternellement jeune du monde  in zionism as well as in negritude whether the writers are gripped by anguish or released by revolt whether they search for uniqueness of race or a freedom from selfexile they all become visionaries who perceive the possibility of a new era in the world senghor who ahad haam who hoped to make of the reconstruction of zion a bridge between east and west giving a positive force to the world also used the image leaven in the dough to denote the necessity of adding a lift to the zionist movement the poetprophets of zionism and negritude who attempted to give the jew and the black man a sense of awareness of self of dignity and pride who attempted to inject the sum total of cultural values in relationship to a heritage when that heritage and potential seemed to have been excluded from the mainstream of world culture can all say like cesaire that ultimately their work is
big tobacco brown stonewall jackson fourquet was a sailor who had found the last portthe inland pantown of new franklin february homecoming man alone all of his family even obscure cousins had found their port too the sweet potatocolored clay of crown hill cemetery a half mile beyond the towns integrated junction of  stonewall jackson fourquet weighed  pounds and was almost six feet tall all the old people remembered him and the violin which had belonged to his father who had played at the cakewalk dances attended by sonnys grand parents the original violin had been lost many years ago had been replaced time and again the old sailor said the sea is my wife and the violin my first born he arrived in new franklin with a brand new violin that he had bought in hamburg germany and played it that friday night at the hughes chapel methodist church social played in the beginning foreign music or so it seemed we had heard such music occasionally at the movies and on the radio and when enlightened blacks and whites from howard county and the surrounding counties descended on us with a paper bag of classical music displaying a warm toothy smile hed say i played this in paris and the white folk didnt know what to think of me playing that kind of music or a chinaman in marseilles or you aint heard nothing until you have heard a gypsy play a violin im gonna do my best to be a gypsy tonight for you and we sat hushed hypnotized in our pews and were transported to the gypsy caves of spain to barcelona you knew from the tone of the violin that the gypsies in spain were not like the mongrel pickedchicken looking gypsies that visited our town coffee hot chocolate gingerbread and deepdish apple pie was served during the intermission but everyone just wanted to crowd around and say hello and shake the hand of the local boy who had traveled the seven seas  afterwards stonewall jackson fourquet switched into god bless america and ended with a pure breathtaking swing low sweet chariot a foottapping handclapping when the saints go marching in hughes chapel was on fire that cold friday night already people were calling him jackson or saying hey stonewall as if they had known him all their lives a rollicking legend he shared his real foreign world with our foreign world of dreams and went to board in the widow wilma clarks house and sleep in her spare back room which overlooked her prized cherry trees soon he was playing all over the county and for white folks too winters were long lonely and cold the only warmth was from our houses open fires and from within ourselves church once a week but sometimes it snowed so hard there wasnt any church services it was work to bundle up and go uptown to the movies on sunday afternoons the roxy was often closed because of weather and poor attendance from saturday nights showing some of us had manual phonographs and your best bet was a batteryoperated radio in case the power lines blew down or were frozen that late winter was better than most because we had stonewall jackson fourquet we talked about him constantly and saw what he had seen in our minds spring came early that year and you could hear him playing under the big shade tree beside the tracks near the railroad roundhouse and in the sweet evenings when he wasnt playing for white people on mrs wilma clarks pillared side porch he often reminisced he had a locker trunk of mementoes and photographs carefully pasted into handtooled leatherbound scrapbooks he had arrived during the cold weather which made the tattoos turn ashen like the skin of an old alligator sitting in the sun but now it was spring and his great brown arms glowed through hairy sweat an iridescent frieze roses mermaids skull and bones ships girls names and crude berber blue xs on his lollipop ears reciting foreign tales in a deep slow preachers voice or like a dying wind storm sitting on a wooden soda pop case down by the viaduct or in front of the red dog cafe someone would say hey jackson play us a little tune and hed reply what would you boys like to hear while waiting for us to make up our minds hed drift into something like darktown strutters ball the violin secure under the double layer of chin fat like a stiff board in a ton of soft concrete closing his eyes on you are my sunshine and the early morning air seemed filled with daisies daisies sprouting in moist green fields and we knew what we had suspected all along stonewall jackson fourquet was courting mrs wilma clark who was seven years his senior we were very happy for the woman who had lost her lower dental plate and lived in a dark antiquecluttered house and baked the best cakes in town that missouri summer was a county fair the yearly flood never reached its peak there was only one death sonnys girl friends oldest sister died mysteriously in weston sam lawson the town drunk found a permanent job sonnys cousin graduated from high school in boonville and received a scholarship to jefferson citys lincoln university and sonny had discovered hemingway and a new world swallowed him whole it took him a long time to recover from hemingway he did not understand mary ellas volume of freud and if he did not understand the gypsies he was at least fascinated by them foreign colorful wanderers a caravan of them arrived late in july and camped in the vacant lot fronting the new handsome white high school this lot was also headquarters for the toby ward tent shows the midwests broadway and summer stock sonny visited the gypsy caravan each morning the gypsies slept late except for a gypsy boy and girl who met him beside the school children crossing sign where they shared dr pepper soda pop and ate green apples stared and grinned at each other in a shy warm fashion the gypsy children were not interested in baseball and always did number one and two in broad daylight they seemed to eat nothing but corn one day stonewall jackson fourquet said to sonny gypsies all over the world boy once i was in algeciras spain it was a hot august night and i was a little blue black and blue i didnt even feel like playing my violin i didnt want no spanish poontang i jest started and walked out of the crowded harbor walked until i saw some gypsies camping on a little bay just outside of town behind pine trees it was hot and i was sweating like a nigger on election day the gypsies were frying fish and there was light from the campfires and moon like croquet wickets a strange light that wasnt like no day or night light pretty soon the gypsies started singing and clapping their hands they played guitars too and i wished  had brought along my violin i was so lonely i jest stood a little ways off and watched them and id never felt lonely nowhere in the world i looked up at that sky getting a little black like dark was setting in though it must have been around midnight the moon was trapped like a rabbit behind clouds i knew i had to go home i was born here and i was tired of traveling i jest wanted to rest with my violin  sonny and the old sailor were standing up by smittys gas station where the local fayette and boonville buses stopped heres a dime boy git you some soda pop or something thanks mr fourquet sonny said starting off he had learned when the old sailor wanted to be alone that very night mrs wilma clark had a stroke and died before morning and soon it was september and we knew winter was just around the bend and we began rationing our laughter or so it seemed sonnys grandpa was very happy that september his daughter laura jane scudder arrived with her naval bridegroom sonnys grandpa had worked for her parents as housemangardener had babysat with laura jane just as soon as laura jane had unpacked and introduced her husband to her father she brought him over to meet uncle charlie and aunt dora grandma served iced tea in the company glasses and stonewall dropped by and played sweet and sassy until dusk the naval officer kept his eyes on stonewall they talked of hong kong bombay port said of ships and the sea and soon afterwards they were meeting every day in the negro beer garden behind oconnors bar and restaurant where they drank corn liquor until it was time for the young groom to stagger to his fatherinlaws house on east main street and fall into his fairhaired brides arms mr scudder told sonnys grandpa hell he hasnt finished sowing his wild oats him and jackson are both navy men hell laura jane was worried crazy she stopped sonny in front of the post office one afternoon jumped out of her new ford car and grabbed sonny by the arm sonny boy i want you to tell uncle charlie that hes got to do something about stonewall and my husband keith hasnt had a drop since hong kong and look at him now what will people think grandpa upon receiving the message sighed so hard his mustache looked as if it might take off like a long winged bird ill talk to him grandpa said the following morning a saturday stonewall jackson fourquet walked slowly through the gate of their house morning dora he said im leaving i jest came by to say goodbye to sonny sonny was in the kitchen devouring his favorite breakfast scrambled eggs and potato cakes he had heard stonewalls dying wind storm voice and had silently said no and looked down at his plate sonny grandma called brightly someone wants to see you and guess what they have for you im coming the boy said running out of the house and feigning a smile ill see you boys later grandma said i have to bake bread sonny and the sailor sat down on the front porch stoop and stared out at the morning monochromatic street scene the sky was colorless the air humid white frame houses sand colored dust and gravel and like a giant proclamation the motionless leaves on the trees i saw your grandpa and i aint leaving cause of what miss laura jane said youre leaving for good yes stonewall jackson fourquet said he gave sonny a long razor with a carved ivory handle thank you sonny said accepting the gift for seaborne dreams thats all right the old sailor said i came back home i cant say i have been unhappy here it was jest as good as growing up in new franklin but talking to that young man made things stir in me again all the love and money in the world couldnt make me stay in this town the sea is my friend and what man would desert his best friend
a white man creates a sexless black man and then invites the cats momma and daddy to dinner and we who have some kind of wild unique copyright on signification are expected not to recognize same it would appear that the white imagination scene of the assumption overload would cast upon us an unbelievable nigger in yet another attempt at denying the nigger they hold sacred which of course implies that theyre not so out of it as reflected by their endless rituals of the mind and those lame reports that flow therefrom the wouldbe work of art in question is the years smash sidney poitier spectacular that will leave you not merely trying to guess who came to dinner but indeed drive you to a whole new level of confusion if you seek to understand exactly what came to dinner the black

that all the pains of loneliness encountered since being widowed would vanish like dandruff blending with supermarket blond hair she is bringing him home to meet mommy and pappy who of course belong to that select group of white citizens who did not instruct her in the ofay science of racism but as though to prove that modern white folk are slicker than them bygone crackers they give sugar and spice the urge to act human and save the blindfoldthe one that leaves man thinking his relation to animal is a mythfor puppy dog tails you dig it wasnt because i didnt want to says little miss muffett to a shocked mommy who in the world we know wouldve taken everybody through new chances with her tales about w wanting to get in a groove with sambo but the moviemakers their insidiousness approaching distant heights would take that ancient value that has so rigidified and immobilized white america and contaminate we who have never thought lovemaking a crime you instinctively know that the fan is not safe from the bowels but they dont even bother to bring the crap on subtly old dad turns out to be no more than another awkward elmer fudd who never once conceived of the abstractions in his lifelong philosophy coming to life and his response to this event that left him and his money helpless is that all that superficial leverage which had been his manhood came to a rapid demise he peels before our eyes and with out our sympathy down to his core near his dried up old seed symbolized of course by his dropping his coffee up tight the hollywood way but he could just as easily have gone running for the exlax but one cannot be certain that the old dudes disassembling was entirely the result of the impending nuptials for we too would endure some kind of wild shock if we were whitey come face to face with this fellow of cottonfield heritage strutting into our oalace with credentials enough to embarrass einstein who was they say one of the great white thinkers notwithstanding the fact that he failed to save jack and jill from their perversion so much for the plot the circus ensues featuring the same old drumbeat that has taught the world how much mr and mrs america are out of tune but of course claims contemporary relevance because the boy with the briefcase pretending to be a man once was a cat who knew an honorable way of getting out of his bvds true to its reputation as a world of few real climaxes white america using her socalled artists as much as her copsimposes another unreal climax upon us cloaked in garments of weakness designed to attract our tears but guaranteed to remind us that its all a farce covering up the same human body and its condition to the scene come superniggers parents all aflame over his decision to wed little red riding hood pun but sweet mother black soon succumbs to the depth of understanding emerging from mother hood which leaves out of harmony with the universe only papa hood god himself and naturally the big black wolf whose laddie went astray bring on the dramatics baby some mystical voice must have hollered because mr world leader suddenly inhales a streak of cool honesty and digs his faulknerian legacy for what it is cops a pleait was nothing moreand proceeds to give as though it contained some pertinence his blessings to the brave and daring couple of course he did not mention that the first step towards their happy dointhethang days would best be to behead him with precision not unlike that with which he had long ago deballed himself but the black conquerors old man must have been hip to that because even as they faded away from the screen finally he appeared to be doing something less than sanctioning what had just gone down perhaps even whitey is unable to tell a whole lie having not extracted all the humanity from either the black father or the soul sister maid who on occasion delivers real lines that evoke real laughter but he sure as hell tried and one is actually left pitying him because he

following is the way james h malone describes his approach to art and the people i like to roam the streets in my spare time getting inspiration and ideas  i can see beauty where others see slums    im in touch with inner city people who are in touch with one another  i can see something to portray in an old house where the whites moved out i can see on th street   business as usual i see my old friends chacha big red wall street and cynthia scott then i glance through a window and i see a ghetto mother making handmedowns and i walk around the corner and run into a pretty ghetto girl  my people this ghetto area just exists it is something different to paint im not a crusader and trying to say something about poverty its just an accident that im painting it im surrounded by the things i portray mr malone is talking about detroit where he lives and works he lives on the midwest side near one of the communities which went up in smoke during the rebellion of  he works as a commercial artist doing newspaper advertisements for a large retail department store a native of georgia mr malone attended morehouse college later studied under scholarship at the famous artists art school and at the society of arts and crafts in detroit his works have won awards at atlanta university in the us army and he has the distinction of being the first black georgian to receive the george h clapp art award his artistic focus on the black community has gained him salutes by local radio and television stations mr malone also creates cartoons some have appeared in negro digest and greeting card illustrations he plans to offer a series of cartoons for syndication i feel that i am immortalizing americana he says americana of my time making the contemporary live though i have much respect for abstract art and appreciate it it does not give enough record of our clothing styles architecture habits and moods 
i am white not povertystricken freer than most because of a certain nimbleness of utterance too old now to feel or regret the loss of all the promises of the american dream but i am sick at heart of the paralysis that will not let me be my brothers keeper of the years and the agonies that let me know fully as much as the black people that my life in this country and its ideology have been a lie that the whole testament of libertarian ideas and promises i was told to live by and defend with my life has been a pious fraud i look upon our gross corruption of the rights of man the ground rules that are supposed to order my daily existence here and know that to accept this corruption is committing a sin against my own senses against the light that is in me if i accept without daily rising anger these present past and future disparities in the human condition i realize i am committing the greatest of sins that of hypocrisy which blinds a man to his own failings and gives him a false idea of his position and purpose in the world those words written from the soul of a man in a chapter called the souls of white folks reveal the rare honesty of a white american who could write a book the right of revolution beacon press  in which hetruman nelson supports the black mans right indeed his human obligation to free himself from the tyranny of whites by as malcolm said any means necessary truman nelsonslike stringfellows and mertons and lennie brucesis a voice too few of his white countrymen have actually heard which is of course related to the institutionalized racism brother carmichael speaks of for let there be no mistake if the liberals whove been running the show hadnt so cleverly stored such voices in the attic of idealism and entertainment the my fellow americans mentality would not be the intelligence level to which most of this republics citizens aspire any black man who has faced a white audience in this country and their nauseating questions has wanted desperately to shove such books as this down their throatsliterallyuntil they choke up all those tv commercials without which they would have no testament to their being for truman nelson historian and novelist did not start writing yesterday and one cannot sympathize with white people who rather than face their ignorance persist in defending and glorifying an educational process in which one who would have had them know something real about their history and their real heroes john brown robert david thoreau theodore parker wendell phillips had no place but this book as well should be digested by those blacks who are occupying the places and the rejected personalities of liberated whites as fast as they fleebecause there is not alive in this land today any man more deluded than a black man who has convinced himself that he doesnt understand why the brother is raising so much hell functional blacks are asking some pretty inane questions these days giving truth to nelsons observation that there has never been an instance in the history of the world where an oppressed people have been educated for freedom by their taskmasters my italics that sentence and this book should be read as many times as is required to comprehend their importance david llorens
