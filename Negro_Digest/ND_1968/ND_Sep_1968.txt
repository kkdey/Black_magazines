the fragmented movement
by s e anderson
ver since the first slaves the black liberation movement in america has embraced at least five different goals in the past the styles and rhetoric have been noticeably different for each goal today there are dangerous similarities in style and rhetoric between those who seek incorrect accommodationistwithdrawers goals and those who seek the correct revolutionary one at this prerevolutionary juncture it is imperative that black  people be informed about our fragmented and stagnant movement what is attempted here is a contribution to black critical analysis of the five major factions within the black movement  the integrationist historically the integrationist has incorrectly viewed the american institutions as racist by exception rather than by rule the integrationist believes in the deception of the american governmental structure having provisions for black redress of grievances he also believes that he actually can participate in the decisionmaking processes of his country and that because of a few racist and economic barriers black people have been denied their full firstclass share of the capitalistic goodies the integrationist believes that we have progressed through moral suasion via civil_rights legislation in most cases he accepts black culture as a somewhat lesser tributary culture of the white american cultural mainstream most integrationists do not see america as a powerful but degenerate world imperialist those integrationist who do see this feel that by injecting blackfolk into the existing american framework they will cool out the degeneracy it is clear they do not fathom the fact that when power corruptsit corrupts absolutely the integrationist believes in the minorityconcept that is america is at once a meltingpot and a pluralistic society this belief hides the most ram pant and fundamental problem racism it is extremely important to take note of the integrationists religious acceptance of capitalism being the best most humanistic politicoeconomic system to them all capitalism needs in order to fulfill the american dream is some black reform in the final analysis the integrationist suicidally depends upon white analysis and white assertions to determine his destiny he views selfdetermination as solving the bourgeois desires of materialism and immoralism to have the money to choose an el dorado over a continental to be able to determine without guilt which white bitch should have her racial myths fulfilled indeed the integrationists interests are selfish corrupt and diametrically opposed to the liberation of black people  the citystatesman there are similarities between the integrationist and the citystatesman with regard to their reactionary attitude to every white american assertion one segment of the citystatesman group envisions the american politicoeconomic structure as legitimate and thus seeks to enter it by initially withdrawing and building the blackening cities into politically and economically powerful quasiautonomous citystates destined to vie for influence and control of white americas capital and resources the other segment believes that black cities can be simultaneously independently autonomous of the american doliticoeconomic structure and also exist within it as communal noncapitalist citystates what citystatesman cannot or refuse tosee is that white america will allow a pluralistic society only on its terms with respect to how it will be benefited yes white america will give up her cities to blacksand move all of its vital institutions industry communications banks airports etc into the suburbs the black citystates would be surrounded by white police and military    forever on the edge of their triggers most of the citystates capital would be funnelled in through federal aid this would mean that the us government would have the first and last say about how and when to spend who should work and who should not many citystatesmen believe that these islands of black people surrounded by the sea of white america physically constitute a black nation they fail to realize that to have a nation is to have land control of human and natural resources and a culture defined and common among the people the nationalism of the citystatesman serves merely as an aid to white america in retaining black people as colonial subjects more precisely colonies have the facade of being independent if the colonized bourgeoisie are the administrators and civil servants the im mediate authority is loyalist black and the ultimate authority is the white colonizer witness the struggle for community control of the black schools the government will allow community control of the schoolsas long as they determine the framework philosophy hiring policies and the finances currently there are two different political proposals which are being discussed among the citystatesmen one is to politically deal through the democratic and republican parties as black blocs the other is to form a third political partysome say allblack others say a blackradicalwhite coalition party a la peace and freedom party the blacks who seek changes through these two proposals do not understand the following two things  that one of the reasons why political parties become viable parties within the white american context is that they are founded upon racist assumptions and  the limitations of black political parties having no alliance with the militaryindustrial complex for it is primarily because the democratic and republican parties are extension of the militaryindustrial complex that they are existing a black political party cannot align with any type of white political or economic institution unless it is a political party of suicidal blacks we must never forget that it is the nature of every white institutionbe it radical liberal or conservativeto be racist and therefore exploitive towards blackfolk  back to africaism this sect splits itself into two fundamental factions a the brothers and sisters who want only to physically return to africa and b the brothers and sisters who want only to spiritually culturally and socially return to africa superficially to many the two ideas sound good but upon a deeper analysis we discover that they are not good ideas they are rather symptoms of withdrawal the afroamerican who wishes for a permanent mass migration of blackfolkor even a permanent migration of intellectuals and techniciansto africa is one who consciously or unconsciously affirms the myth of the invincible white man in most cases it is the intellectual rationalization of a brothers inability to struggle against oppressive forces hence some suggest that we return to africa and lead africa toward a colonialfree destiny how does the repatriatist know that our african brothers want us to lead them anywhere our african brothers are having enough hard times struggling against their internal and neocolonial contradictions to also have to cope with the psychocultural hangups of afroamericans this is to say that we do not abandon our communications military economic and cultural exchange between us rather it is to accentuate at this stage the necessity for twoway exchange of individuals rather than a oneway mass migration we cannot escape the racism and colonialism of america by running to africa because americas racism and colonialism are institutionalized everywhere moreover if most of our revolutionary forces were in africa we would be committing a cardinal sin withdrawing ones forces from the belly and brain of the enemv it should  be made clear that this does not mean that brothers should not go over and join the african liberation armies it means those chosen afroamerican brothers who do so should not be only highly skilled in guerilla warfare but also skilled in some field relevant to the needs of the african country for which he is fighting on the other side of the backtoafrica mask we are confronted with the apolitical cultural nationalists they stress that if black people dug on the natural fact that black is beautiful then they would be liberated the apolitical cultural nationalists fail to check out the neocolonies of africa ghana nigeria senegal liberia kenya malawi etc in these countries blackfolk by and large still see blackness as beautifulbut it has not liberated them thev do not control their resources tneir capital or their politics witness all the military coups the africans culture is somewhat in tact and creative but without a political framework culture is not a liberatory force the root of the matter is that afroamerican apolitical cultural nationalists perceive blackness as necessary and sufficient when in reality blackness is necessary but not sufficient on the psychocultural level apolitical cultural nationalism is a reaction and withdrawal rather than an assertion once again we see that it is a negative spiral inward because of the belief in the myth of the white mans invincibility it is also a desire to prove to ones ego and to the white man that a black man is creative out of this frustration of contradictions sprout black cults and mysticism ie withdrawal symptoms the black artist becomes more of a nihilist than a creative person he perceives blackfolk as his burden instead of his inspiration the center of the universe becomes an overglorification of his ego african history and paradoxically the black masses through constructive criticism and the existence of correct ideology many of the straightupanddown cultural brothers and sisters will redirect their creativeness and become functional people embraced by a revolutionary political structure  black nation concept imbedded in the rationale of most brothers seeking a new black nation are withdrawal symptoms resembling those of the backtoafrica brothers the black nation concept does notand cannot deal with the fact that black peo pie built america by their enchained sweat blood and brains america is ours for the take withdrawing from america does not weaken or eradicate its racism to the contrary in withdrawal america is strengthened and offered an almost perfect framework for black genocide white america would view the new black nation as a black communist threat more concretely judging from the types of brothers and sisters who expound defend and rally around this idea it exudes the belief that it is impossible to liberate black people within the awesomely powerful confines of white america hence the new black nation concept reeks with contradictions one of the most blatant contradictions is that of white people being willing to pay for the birth of a black nation on the one hand the new nation separatists vividly describe america as being by naturea racist country that has systematically excluded blackfolk from all its institutional processes indeed this is true then by what twist of fate would white racist america wish to aid in the development of a black nation right at its doorstep unless exploitation and genocide was in mind many of the new nation separatists suggest that scattered blackcontrolled cities constitute a nation this contradiction has been discussed above a federation of cities as a nation is stressed rather than the evolutionary development of revolutionary nationalism among black people many discuss the idea of a getting electoral control of the cities and the black belt then b inviting the united nations as world observer of white america because c international law allows five or six southern states to secede from the union history has exposed the united nations as anything but humanistic and neutral history has shown that the united nations and its international laws are mere tools of america and its western allies for the maintenance of their imperialist machine witness the united states breach of the geneva conventions decisions concerning vietnam witness the arabisraeli conflict witness the u ss instantaneous intervention into the dominican republic in  witness the congo interventionbut no intervention in south africa it is crystal clear that the international laws deal with nonwhites exactly in the same manner as americas constitutional laws as colonial subjects the republic of new africa appoints brother robert f williams as presidentinexile robert f williams is a romantic revolutionary partially of his own makings and partially because he has not been continually on the american scene being a brother exiled in the third world one should take note of the other governmentsinexile such as the tiny antimaoist island of formosa and the counterrevolutionary claguided revolutionary angolan government in exile when the socalled leader or groups are not in physical and spiritual touch with their people they fall prey to romanticism and cooptation when the new nation concept fails to understand the relationship between military strategy and geography we witness a pathetic and selfdefeating contradiction the republic of new africa is to be created from the southern states j east of texas and north of florida strategically florida would be i come an ideal american military base in terms of military strategy for the new republic of new africa it would have to spread its forces to defend three land borders the north south and west in brief the new nation concept is the pipedream of black nationalists frustratedly overwhelmed because of their simplistic approach to white racism and colonialism  revolutionary nationalism in conclusion if we are for the liberation of black people then we must seek the correct path towards revolution that is the path of revolutionary nationalism more precisely we must seek change change in institutions change in who is in charge change in values then we must be able to implement and enforce these changes in other words america as it exists today must be completely destroyed and then rebuilt in the terms of the new black manfor whites have rendered themselves incapable of humanistic creativity the methodology for correct revolutionary nationalism is comprised of reformist stages dialogues designed to change negroes into blacks education lifelong commitment and consistent criticism of self and ideology    and most important winning the confidence of black people brother bill strickland constantly reiterates and correctly so that there has been no critique of the american society visavis black reality there have only been reactions to the system and not a development of a countersystem why because black intellectuals accept white analysis as the correct analysis this has historically resulted in black people acting more like accommodationists and withdrawers than resisters this is not to deny the historical fact of daily slave rebellions or the current urban uprisings it is merely to emphasize that our actions have been apolitical and oftentimes vacuous because of a lack of a black critique of the american scene further negative consequence of blacks dependency upon white analysis is the legitimacy of corruptness within the black movement because whites are corrupt and immoral their liberalradical analysis is corrupt and immoral the movements corruption is just the symptom the flame one of the root causesor fuels is the absence of a welldefined line rhetoric serious black terminology is loosely thrown around by  integrationists separatists and pseudorevolutionaries the black fascists a doyourownthing atmosphere surrounding the movement makes it valid for an accommodationist like whitney young and his urban league colleagues to support black_power it makes it valid for an opportunist such as roy innis to negotiate with the colonial powers for the sake of black selfdetermination and black economic power the rootlessness of the terminology invites a myriad of wierd immoral and agent prococateurs to satisfy their twisted and often antiblack lusts we will see that through a tightly defined terminology of black morality will develop its existence will transpose every actincluding the sexual actinto an ethical and political act this is not to say that the black movement will be entrenched in rigidity a black morality will naturally mean firmness and flexibility the black moralitys vitality lies in its ability to define confine and refine our liberation struggle it is the black aethestics becoming ethical    and the black ethics becoming aethestical it is the black man seeing himself as a revolutionary more than that it is the brother or sister who asserts that to be a revolutionary is to be for life    never forgetting that we must have an undying love for our people we must struggle to learn and    learn to struggle

a short story
by paula fox
fter the funeral we a stood around awhile on the street corner right near the funeral parlor there was a lot of vegetables in crates sitting out in front of a grocery store and i couldnt help my eyes sliding over to those big purple bananas that the puerto ricans buy flies was buzzing over everything but those purple bananas wasnt even sweating like the other fruit flies didnt bother them they lay there looking like they was in a cold cellar they made me feel bad and i dont know why my wifei dont live with her no more but we still marriedshe was crying and moping up her face and pulling at her dress because she was so hot i couldnt stop myself from seeing she was getting fat especially in her shoulders why do i have to notice so much somel times i wish i was a little like her holler when things are bad and n h laugh when its okay but not me im always seeing the things that are all around what i should be paying attention to like when i go for a job im watching the mans face seeing how his teeth fit in his jaws what his shirt cuffs look like and what hes got on his desk instead of asking him where and how much and how long mv wife calls curtis the little baby i dont understand why she thinks hes so little he is old enough to be buried in his cadet suit qu te a few people came to the funeral mostly neighbors i guess even my brother came i havent seen him for eight years and after he looked at curtis lying in the coffin he remarked how big hed grown but then the last time hed seen curtis was just a few months after hed been born when we were still living in brooklyn before we moved uptown what are you looking at those vegetables for when you should be thinking about your dead baby my wife cried and yvonne who is  now started howling and grabbed my wife around her middle yvonne looked very neat i noticed and her shoes were all polished up i hadnt seen her for a long time i used to go by and visit them but my wife and i always had to have our fight and it got so the children would just go out of the room to get away so i hardly ever had a chance to talk to them what good is thinking about him going to do him now i asked her you should of thought about him when you let him go up to the roof all the time just so you could be alone to work yourself all up about what a mean bastard i was and how bad i did you she began to yell and moan i couldnt even make out what she was saying i started wondering how they  got curtis to look so nice when he had fallen four stories to the street then the grocer came out and waved his hands at us and shouted in spanish calling us names probably most of the people who had come to the funeral had gone off down the street my brother was standing in front of the funeral parlor and talking to light marsh who is my wifes cousin i dont know why he came to curtis funeral thats a man whos hardly interested in anything living or dead except his car but he was going to drive us out to the cemetery so i didnt make my usual remarks about him it was a terrible hot drive light all the time talking about these gadgets hes got for his caddie and pointing at them with his long finger and driving with the other hand while my wife carried on in her corner my brother kept grinning at light and then turning around to look sad at me yvonne rested herself against my ribs and i patted her head and felt sorrier for her than i did for anybody else suddenly she looked up while light and my brother were arguing about which was the fastest way to the cemetery why did they have that doll in the window she asked me at first i didnt know what she meant then i remembered that in the funeral parlor window on a shelf there had been this plastic doll held upright by some kind of metal prong and the doll had a crown and was wearing some kind of lace cape when i first walked in i had noticed how dusty the shelf was and how the crown looked like it was made out of a silver candy wrapper i dont know i answered isnt it supposed to be for dead people why they get that doll then she whispered maybe shes supposed to be a saint of something like that i said dont tell her none of your lies my wife said light had begun to talk about the war and this country and how crazy everything was getting and what hard times were coming and i laughed hard times coming i said what i want to know is when are they goingt you ought to get into a steady business my brother said i think hes been saying that since i was three and he was five you mean like the numbers i asked why dont you go to school and take up something he asked you ought to grab whats there he know all about grabbing said my wife did it hurt curtis yvonne asked all of a sudden i got scared sitting in that big white car that probably had  payments left on it with my brother all shut into his best suit and my wife getting fatter every minute and light marsh  telling me all about the world and yvonne asking me questions like i was supposed to know everything no baby no it couldna hurt him my wife said he didnt know what hit him the ground hit him yvonne said and sat up straight then pretty soon yvonne starts out with daddy but we was there and i got busy getting out of the car ill never know what she was going to ask me maybe who the hell was i anyhow some of the people who had been at the parlor had got there their own way and they were standing near the hole with the preacher his head was bowed and sweat was running doyn his forehead they had this carpet maybe five feet by five made out of stuff that was supposed to look like grass and it was spread over the dirt they had dug out of curtis grave there were so many gravestones sticking up out of the ground you wouldnt think there was room for one more child the coffin was closed up now it had a sling around it so it could be lowered into the ground there were two men standing a few yards away leaning on shovels gravediggers i guess they were wearing caps and work clothes they didnt have any expression at all on their faces but even so i thought they was laughing at us maybe its because i figure colored people is funny to white people whether theyre dead or alive i had this picture of myselfit was so fast i hardly saw itof me lifting up one of those shovels and bashing their heads in they threw some dirt on curtis and lowered him and i heard the preachers voice getting louder but i couldnt get any sense out of what he was saying the graveyard stretched further than i could see i heard cars so i knew there must be big highways all around light said hed drive us back to the parloi my brother went off with some man who was going his way he shook my hand before he left and told me not to feel too bad and i said yeah id try not to light showed off all the way back asking yvonne would she like a doll and telling me to drop around hed get me a good job and asking how we was paying for all this funeral expense i didnt want to talk about that i gave my wife the thirtyeight dollars i had and she must have got the rest somewhere maybe from her daddy who runs an elevator in an apartment building downtown and has a little house with a yard in the bronx i dont know why he didnt come to curtis funeral maybe because he knew id be there we got out of the car in front of the grocery store my wife wasnt crying anymore but she looked awful her hat was coming down the back of her head and her eyes looked big and starey you want to go to a movie i asked what is the matter with you she said yeah daddy can we go yvonne asked well  i thought it would be better so you dont have to go back home right now theres a loews right up here near by she was looking at me but i was looking over her shoulder there were fewer bananas in the box now somebody must have been buying them while we were out putting curtis in the ground dont you feel badt she asked like shed been thinking hard to find the thing to say that would straighten me out i feel bad i said then we all started to walk up the block and pretty soon we came to the movie i didnt look to see what was playing it was cool inside that big black coolness ive always liked about movies hardly anybody was in there a few people with nothing to do getting out of the sun i bought yvonne some peanuts and she settled back in her seat my wife took off her hat and sank down and rested her head they were showing a cartoon it didnt look so good on that big screen the animals had those faces that dont look like anything living or dead and the voices they put in them were screaming and laughing and hooting so loud it made me hunch down in the seat i don t know    but i think theres nothing worse than that nothing sadder anyhow than a movie on a hot weekday afternoon with maybe a dozen people sprinkled around watching a cartoon thats supposed to be for children i began to feel so bad sitting there looking at my wifes and yvonnes faces in the light from the screen then looking back at the cartoon and seeing some goddam big mouse in a cape running along the floor that i couldve yelled and then i did yell my wife and yvonne grabbed me up out of the seat and took me up the aisle and i was yelling all the time thinking of how the street would be of those sweating rotting vegetables at the grocers and that plastic doll and light marsh in his white mans car and curtis dead and dressed up like he was going to war and the man i had to see tomorrow about a job sorting packages none of it mattered not even my yelling mattered we were all gone not just curtis but yvonne my wife and me gone gone gone

toward a black aesthetic
by don l lee
hat is a black poet w what is black poetry what is the black aesthetic these and other surface questions have become central topics for discussion at most literary circles and in my estimation need more than surface answers obviously if we deal properly with the three questions posed we will discover some of the basics of black art a black poet is not a negro he is first and foremost a black man or woman he is positive of his identity and has no second thoughts on how he should address himself he fully realizes as sncc points out that the slave traders brought black men and africans to this country not negroes whereas the negro is a filthy invention which didnt come into existence until about  these brothers and sisters write out of a concept of self rather than that of a negro or imitation white ie he will relate the black experiencein essence his true experiencewhich is a result of his lifestyles undoubtedlythe true black experience in most cases is very concrete and is opposed to any unrelated abstractions concrete sleeping in subways being bitten by rats six people living in a kitchenette the images and symbols that are used will come out of the poets immediate surroundings and will accent his particular lifestyle this means that black poets will deal with themselves as individuals first and then will move toward a concept of peoplehood better yet they will move from the i to the we to the us and to the our the black poet is at all times in tune with his people he is an integral part of the black community a guiding force a walking example as opposed to a walking contradic tion black for the black poet is a way of life as brother marvin x has said the black poet must study his own poems heretofore negro arists and writers there are exceptions were too busy playing artist and writer imitating white boys that is they were too busy with their thing to be intimately concerned with their people today as far as the black poet is concerned black people come first people then art what good or use is art without the people also what good is art if it doesnt communicate with the people black poets write out of a concept of art for peoples sake and not art for arts sake we feel that art for arts sake is an invalid concept and belongs back in greece  bc the poet in studying his own poems in essence continually studies himself the black poet is writing to black people and not to whites also in studying his own poetry and the poetry of other black poets the black poet as well as his readers will receive directionpositive direction black poets will live their poems they themselves will be poems black poets do not tell the people the danger of white filth and then dwell in such filth themselves black poets do not tell of the death of dope and other drugs  and turn around and use such extremes of death themselves black poets will be examples of their poems and if their poems are righteous the poet will be righteous and he will be a positive example for the black community not another contradictor black poetry not only gives positive direction to the community but shows the people black beauty and black substance our poetry will enable the people to see themselves and as opposed to most scientific data realize that we are universal and are the first people black poets blkartists per se are culture stabilizers bring back old values and introduce new ones black poets are continually defining and redefining present values and will help destroy anything that is detrimental to our advancement as a people black poetry will give the people a future will show visions of tomorrow as leroi jones puts it we must in the present be missionaries of blackness of consciousness actually in the coming chaos any place of knowledge any vessel any collection of black consciousness will create a polarity people then will want to know what to do tell them now as you would then as they run through the streets looking for safety you see black poetry will not necessarily teach the people how to die but will teach the people how to live we must live we must show those who control the world how to live redefine man and put man in his proper perspective in relation to other men and to the world we must move that white boy toward righteousness show him what a human being is and can be show him what sister jewel c latimore calls utopia brothers brothers everywhere and not a one for sale talk for days to blkpeople and tell them that we are universal but define for them as brother ethridge knight does no universal laws of human misery create a common cause or common history that ease black peoplese pains nor break black peoples chains of course everywhere you turn you will be confronted with superidiots who will say with exasperated authority that you are writing protest poetry but we will not swing on the cat not yet at least we will as brother keorapetse kgositsile has done explain what black poetry is i do not write protest poetry my poetry is a love poetry check out any black ghetto in the world listen to the songs that move people to the innovation of all kinds of dances and crazy hollers and tell me if that is not love my poetry is that spirit throbbing with the love of millions of black people all over the world but the impulse is personal black poetry comes out of a love for ones self what is at the bottom a love of ones people how can you really love yrpeople if you dont love yrself and im not talking about narcissism brother kgositsile is more than accurate when he calls his poetry love poetry its the love of ones people that is embodied in his poetry the will to survive as a nation of black people blackness transcends all artificial bordersblackness will speak of and to the third world when norman jordan talks of feeding the lions the black brothers and sisters in africa as well as in mississippi will surely understand that lions visit all the black communities they come into our neighborhood with the sun an army of social workers carrying briefcases filled with lies and stupid grins passing out relief checks and food stamps hustling from one apartment to another so they can fill their quota and get back out before dark as brother leroi jones has said and we own the night we not only own the night but we will take the day and make the day a livable place again a place where people can love and create this atmosphere of beautiful days now exists among blkpoets there is a feeling of cooperation and companionship rather than one of competition black poets are not writing for national book awards and pulitzer prizes black poets are not trying to cut each other up there exists a comradeship and closeness that has never beforeespecially in modern literaturebeen able to grow keeping in mind that these young writers most are under  understand that they must complement each other rather than compete against one another thev realize that there is a gross need for the talents of all the blkwriters who can be motivated black poets realize as arthur rimbaud points out that poetry will no longer accompany action but will lead it whereas blk poems will talk to blkpeople and will come like daggers broken brew bottles bullets swift razors from blkhands cutting thru slum landlords and negro dope pushers blk poems will talk to pimps  prostitutes and will aid in the destruction of their actions will come like napalm raids over the white house  all its weird ways blkpoems will tell of the soul in aretha franklins music  tell you that her actions are those of doris day will be sisters burning wigs  false eye lashes brothers cutting off processes  breaking wine bottles over t  honkies heads blkpoems will be gangbangers pulling dope needles out of their arms

come in soulbook and black dialogue will be created in black expressions and liberator with black poetry and other flames of blkart will be the black esthetic as brother larry neal relates it there is no need to establish a black esthetic rather it is important to understand that one already exists i agree with brother neal a blkaesthetic does exist but how does one define it in reference to literature or is it necessary to define it i suggest at this time that we not try however understand that the blkesthetic exists and will continue to be embodied in the work of black artists painters novelists poets etc and will be determined from the forthcoming and existing body of black works dig nobody talked about a white aesthetic until there was an adequate body of work to determine such an aesthetic white critics didnt exploit the joyceian prose until james had put it down nobody talked about the diction of hemingway until the cuban had recorded it on paper you see the white aesthetic if there is such a thing is definable by examining the greater body of western literature black literature as we know it is relatively new this is not to negate the contributions of du bois mckay wright and other blkliterary greats but to realize that these men were primarily addressing themselves to white audiences in the weeks months and years to come black critics will be reading and examining the new black literature and they not white boys will determine what the black aesthetic is as brother clarence major has said we black poets can write poems of pure creative black energy right here in the white west and make them works of art without falling into the cheap marketplace of bull and propaganda and i submit that this is happening from the african dialect of ruwa chiri to the verse of dudley randall from the can you kill nigger of nikki giovanni to the two and three hard lines of mari evans we as black writers have accepted for too long almost without question the assertion that the white way is the right way at last we are able to comprehend that black people see nothing in the same frame of reference as white people not only do we receive and perceive differently but our reaction is noticeably opposed to that of whites check out a whiteoriented fashion show and compare that to the swing of an african fashion showingwe not only can see the difference but feel it rhythm we as blkpoets write out of a concept of self a black thing knowledgeable at all times that mistakes will be made that there will be disappointments and disagree j ments but realizing that these are the actions of black men and black artists we will determine standards of judgment and excellence and no white boys in the pages of the nation the new republic saturday review new york times etc will direct or effect our efforts black people will direct us direction will be a reciprocal process shared between black people  black artists and as sister gloria house has said you cant just go and ask anybody man cause dig they just dont know they aint been where you go everyday they aint been through your neighborhood man they cant give you no directions

ho speaks negro w any black man whos on top of whats happening i arrived at this conclusion in an essay published in negro digest which was written originally in  as a result of my being questioned in regard to melvin tolsons language and karl shapiros evaluation of that language by the threemember examining board during the oral examination for an ma degree in creative writingpoetry at san francisco state college it began then as a reaction to others acts others questionings others thoughts on the subject of colonization and decolonization in language at the time i focused my attention on negro language without properly defining for myself the term negro action and not reaction is a meaningful response to black people don l lee has a fine poem that warns us of the danger of this it is called react for action at any rate the casual questioning by curious bemused white professors bugged me into seriously beginning to explore the unchartered waters of black awareness for myself now three years later in answer to this same question id say every negro speaks negro to a greater or lesser degree for a black writer however a far more relevant question is who speaks black language what is black in the past a poet could be notoriously negro in one poem and very black in another or black in ideology and perspective but negro in the use of the standard english language or vice versa scratch a negro and you will find a nigger and a potential black man scratch a black man and you may find a nigger and the remnants of a negro negro is a psychological sociological and economical fabrication to justify the status quo in america nigger is the tension created by a black mans attempt to accommodate himself to become a negro in order to survive in a racist country black is the selfhood and soul of anyone with one drop of black blood in america who does not deny himself black is most of the writing of paul laurence dunbar richard wright john o killens margaret walker leroi jones langston hughes although exceptions are found here black is the writings of don l lee and carolyne rodgers black pride and think black broadside press and paper soul third world press lerone bennett jr and hoyt fuller the black community has always knownand it is becoming apparent to the worldthat america wants negroes and niggers but not black people don l lee articulates this america calling negroes can you dance play foot baseball nanny cook needed now negroes who can entertain only others not  wanted   are considered extremely dangerous john o killens dubbed america the land of the nigger makers james baldwin makes reference to the observation that the negroinamerica is a form of insanity which overtakes white men the negro is a pathology baldwin also has said that there is no negro finally who has not had to make his own precarious adjustment to the nigger who surrounds him and to the nigger in himself being black then is a reaffirmation of selfhood it is a meaningful antidote to white racism it is a move toward deniggerizing the world population of nonwhite people and of humanizing the white people black is biology geography africa west indies ugaunited ghettos of americathe wrong side of the tracks or freeways black belts black is psychology theology philosophy athletic aesthetic politic it is frantz fanon martin_luther_king jr w e b du bois marcus garvey stokely carmichael aaron douglas and charles white muhammad ali and harry edwards adam clayton powell black language is direct creative intelligent communication between black people based on a shared reality awareness understanding which generates interact tion it is a rhetoric which places premium on imagistic renderings and concretizations of abstractions poetic usages of language idiosyncrasiesthose individualized stylistic nuances such as violation of structured syntaxwhich nevertheless hit home and evoke truth it is an idiom of integrated insight a knowledge emanating from a juxtaposition of feeling and fact which form a perspective of now causing perpetual changes of meaning a major question on my spring final examination in afroamerican literature was define black language and give examples of im portant black words  considered this a serious difficult question and so did my students at merritt junior college in oakland calif where black awareness is a highly  developed reality during the spring black experience the negro was done away with in an effectively eulogized funeral ceremony i must admit an indebtedness to robert decoy whose the nigger bible contained some  words over  of these derivatives of nigger suggesting a burlesque i accepted the challenge in his word i have made the feeble and sincere attempt to begin your dictionary of niggeramerican words perhaps you or some other who come after will improve add to and complete this particular language   have chosen to start with black words rather than negroor nigger words because they are acts of afm firmation rather than reactions at this stage of my research i have upward of  words many words have multiple meanings and separate entry listings my dictionary of black language is proving to be very rewarding and gratifying research some of the student definitions and words were  that language particular to all biologically black persons it is to them their own means of communication defying explanation a rappingto talk to someone for a period on a subject pertaining to blackness b togetheran adjective describing a persons philosophy and total awareness pertaining to blackness   the beautiful way black people communicate with one another a proof if nothing else of a definite and separate distinct culture complex a niggera tag filled with hateandor love used by every black person b brothera unifying greeting in a black community  a dialect of english a means by which a black person can comfortably communicate with another black person without the fear of using improper rhetoric because he is correct every time his improvisational words ring true a come down  explain stop beating around the bush b jivephony not for real  all means of communication used by black people to express themselves not necessarily verbal ones ie the clenched fist among black people means unity for whites it is a symbol of violence and hatred drums music wails hollers a honkologya study of the logic of white thought b dust money  a necessary means of communication among black people in order to relate certain aspects of their lives which could never be accomplished through the usage of socalled proper form of anglosaxon english which is unrelated to the black experience in any positive relevant way  a language of feeling rather that just thought or talk  soul talk forreal downtoearth nittygritty communication and finally the most important question at this stage of black awareness becomes not who speaks black but rather what is black my latest poem explores this mystique black is pigmentation a mirror image of black on black a preference that leans away from fading colors and imitation whites posture an onyourtoes approach to the mazeway of the real world a shoulder squared against whats happeningthe man  the hawk bad luck blues a motion a dance a gesture a cool stance a walking that walk talking that talk that is now man position apartness uniqueness a separatism permitting cutting through white irrelevancies to confront basic issues a revolutionary zeal to overthrow oppressive might a moral obligation to change a wrong to a right perspective a clear black eye that peers through the midnight muck of man a deniggerized aspect and value a defiant thrust to wipe out white wash positives of assertive acts affirmations a strong yes not negatives invisibility non entity pride people power people magic soul an exuberance of existence an escalation of self awareness and appreciation gut knowing buried deep in the womb of oppression turning stone to bone to flesh and blood and tears and smiles to love to life pulling pulling a magnet pulling you all the way back home into a thing that is black

here are new voices very different from the ones that were around before different not only in the sense that they are new but essentially because of their attitude and intended purpose precise as tools in the hands of skillful artisans lebert bethune  tired of strange ghosts whose cool bones lived on the green furnace of my blood makes a juju of my own as one of the means of    baking my destiny to a lullaby   he continues his song so she warned me  my grandmother and now and now when i kindle again her small eyes with their quick lights darting ancient love into my infancy and when i break through to her ancient voice that voice like the pliant red clay she baked she sings the only lullaby she sang me me no care for bakra whip me no care fe fumfum come juju come so i am fashioning this thing my own juju out of her life and our desire out of an old black love i am baking my destiny to a lullaby  lebert bethune in juju of my own a slim volume of robust poetry like most of his peers he has been through american institutions of higher learning and come back disillusioned it is no secret today that any honest blackman in any western institution learns sooner or later that there is a calculated denial of his history of his experience by his oppressor he is taught to aspire to western ideals finally he is taught to understand and interpret his historical experience his present existence and his possibilities through white eyes but any time is with us and if we take control to shape our attitudes and reshape our memories that time is always nowour time for the best possible uses of our lives show the chains let them see the chains as object and subject and let them see the chains fall away says leroi jones so there are these voices which attempt to move us in a very specific direction criticizing us here encouraging us there clarifying for us elsewhere you might say that they are voices from the future and they attempt to prepare us because they know that the future will not change to make room for the undesirable the weak will be strengthened if there is any life left in them and memories of past or future or any time are made of very specific selections from your sensibility memories move us the best possible uses of our fives move us and if we are ahead of the times the responsibility is ours to make the present our time lest we be destroyed gloria house celebrates the new day our time look for mind seering into the future with the intensity of their satellites in orbit and you will find it in our heads and for power latent and imminent like the panthers in our bodies we were not made eternally to weep steady slow knowing like ma rainey with her man the forces of time move on to our time and in these days  uncovered the great deceits of the mans monstrous mind uprooted his stone monuments to himself destroyed the armies of the psychotic decadent dead a race of devils yes this decadethe sixtieshas produced a different caliber of black poets in america the majority of them have been influenced by negritude and protest poets and writers like cesaire senghor david diop langston hughes claude mckay w e b du bois and others these young poets felt the inadequacy of a purely cultural or artistic selfdetermination because the arguments for it and its artifacts generally boil down to an academic masturbation or deviation a kind of mannerismfornicating with the white eye and then emerging on some stage with western arguments for the validity and glory of a black virginity cesaire though among the negritude poets is above this because he is right there seering into the future with the best of the younger poets in practical terms for instance the younger poets realize that the most beautiful poem senghor can write about the validity of the existence of a glorious black culture without attempting to make the social institutions in senegal actually african actually liberated from france does not even improve the diet of a single undernourished black child anywhere in the world where black people are colonized by caucasians most probably not even in independent senegal this does not mean that negritude andor protest poetry is not valid or functional it is but it is inadequate in terms of its best possible social relevance or uses because it is limited to vision it justifies black art and black experience to a white audience here again aime cesaire is clean because to him negritude was an introductory element a prelude to the reemergence of the blackman on the stage of history the young afroamerican poets whose consciousness was awakened and facilitated by negritude and protest poetry among other influences feel an urgency to make their art as potent a weapon as any in the assertion not birth of their humanism in a poem titled the people burning  leroi jones realizes it is choice now like a philosophical problem it is choice now and the weight is specific and personal it is not an emotional decision there facts and who was it said that this is a scientific century jones is not addressing white america or some ideal universal intellect or conscience he is talking to his people about his condition finally theirs because he is his people most of these young writers of this decade after verifying the facts with all the historical evidence necessary emerge strongly convinced of the inhumanity of the western world they come out of western institutions of higher learning strongly convinced that the university in the west is an extension of racism and the socalled cold war which they detest quite often the war is hot past any possible argument for or against it emmett till james powell lumumba malcolm little babies charred while worshipping a western god for the perverted amusement of deranged maniacs and the black poets sensibility explodes the weight becomes specific and personal but the poet does not have explosives for the physical destruction of the west in general and america in particular not yet thus the immediate resort for the black poet is applied poetry he uses his sensibility as ammunition brotherly love virtue construction which by definition embraces and transcends the necessary destruction restoration of human and humane values for the salvation of man now now i see it like this you see da tree ou der its a good shade tree in ne summertime an you know don nobody like to see dey shade tree cud down thus gloria house in her alabama farmers dialectic the alabama farmer like any other colonized person knows that the struggle for liberation is not easy because the oppressor does not want him to be liberated don nobody like to see dey shade tree cud down it is  recognition and acknowledgement it leads to resolution it is dialectic after the farmer has looked around and observed some truths we been dat tree for dem folk for a lotta summers for instance he makes the necessary resolution well i cain be no shade tree all my life dat tree got to come down one a dese days aint dat right for gloria the making of a poetry is not escapist exploration or fantasy that could be shattered to smitherings the moment she ventures into the real world of the beauty of concrete human possibilities or the slime of decadent brutes she never leaves actuality her language reflects this the words she chooses to mold and project the images and symbols to celebrate the nature of her revelationsacts are very contemporary that is they come directly from the world around her her sensibility is informed by the pulse of actual not imagined or imaginary people from alabama and all points white of her vision she was down in alabama giving that pulse form direction she lived and worked with communities in alabama she has been in southern jails for attempting to help the people to cud dat tree down she was working with sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee down south when sncc graduated from the civil_rights schools and late in  she came to new york to tell a conference of civil_rights lawyers why it was time for sncc to be unconditionally an afroamerican revolutionary movement gloria has lived elsewhere with her eyes open sensitive to her condition as a black woman under white domination as witness direction political advice for young brothers its like where you live man and who lives there with you for example you from harlem yeah well coulda been johannesburg or birmingham alabama you know its all the same im from fillmore that makes us brothers man like we grew up in the same family you dig like every attunedtothetwentiethcentury selfrespecting black man and woman gloria believes in unity and panafricanism and she realizes that young brothersyoung in terms of awareness of the world we live inhave problems of identity especially if they grew up in western democratic societies i mean like if you get shaky about stuff like who you are and where youre going ask somebody who lives near you  cause thats where its at man theyll set you straight you cant just go and ask anybody man cause dig they just dont know they aint been where you go everyday very intimate and direct this is education because in any culture education serves to prepare people to be clear about their roles to tap their potential so that their lives can be meaningful so that they can better consolidate their resources and be productive in and useful to their communities the colonial situation is changing the world over the relations between colonizer and colonized are changing in america and elsewhere gloria observes and informs us that they already dance to our drums elemental rhythm of life attuned to the movement of the earth the language in this poem like the period it celebrates is dramatic and pulsates with a divine arrogance it is not however a declaration of war the war is onhas been on this is a song celebrating change the images bathed in the blood that flows when slaves turn men burning plantations be they in newark or kinsangani there is a new chief in the land and all the people will imitate the customs of his tribe and dancing to his heartbeat in his own compound one night at the time they will see his face and they will be astounded that it is black but there are signs of the revolution the young turks of the nation are ours glorias clarity of vision also enables her to see our internal contradictions as a result she can be boldly critical of our mistakes andor hangups as in woman to has the length of one man alone so blurred your view can you leave the sons and daughters of our time motherlessno poems no brown daughter no acts of violence for love squandered on one man you see you have to clearly understand that because we do not have a long active collective memory of popular revolutionary movements because we have endured abuse and all sorts of other perversions so long because we were dehumanized and depersonalized to a point where  we didnt really believe that we could rise as powerful men to threaten and damage the power of the oppressor we developed a tendency to put all our hopes in individual courageous men who better reflected the desires and aspirations we were too afraid to own up to to name a few from contemporary history for instance malcolm muhammad ali patrice lumumba kwame nkrumah rap brown the danger in this sort of tendency is that should the given hero die or should he be killed or run out of the country we are left without direction without even the necessary selfconfidence which would mean that we had shifted all our necessary responsibility from our shoulders to those of a given personality this is criminal this makes us traitors to our cause virtually and gloria comments this is not malcolms sister who sits sobbing for the love of one man while the nation groans for birth yes you see gloria house is striving for truth a measure to facilitate her explorations forever digging past pretenses and whatever superficial images of ourselves our world and our possibilities as barbara simmons might say this aint art its real movin there are other forces in glorias company here is a b spellman for instance looking into himself and other similar victims he readily acknowledges the ugliness he sees    how stay clear in this place do not eat soap relevance pays there squats mundanity kick it in the nuts its crotch swallow your foot now where are you footless hiss of the hideous you goofed in the tactic ab youre still too quiet break something larger but there is more to us than those hideous tendencies we detest    if we are honest a b moved by one of our spiritual heroes john coltrane sings him an impartial review may he have new life like the fall fallen tree wet moist rotten enough to see shoots stalks branches  green leaves  may the roots grow into his side jones says poetry is music made less abstract and i agree because poems dont mean if they are honest like the honest explorations of music throbbing with life does a charlie parker riff mean anything poems are acts in motion and acts processes which involve action and reaction lead inevitably to other acts confrontation forever moving towards resolving whatever other contradiction and i learned that recently after sufficient soulsearching a b spellman left new york to be involved in more direct concrete and relevant acts in black communities in the south listen a little more often to coltrane and then there is edward spriggs whose poetry is adequately representative of the sentiments of the younger afroamerican poets edward s spriggs is new york editor of black dialogue a meeting olace for voices of the black communitywherever that community may exist spriggs states unequivocally my forefathers brought upon this continent phvsical strength intelligence creativity beauty humanism an unparalleled faith and more only the physical strength and that faith has been allowed to function in this consciousless place    our intelligence our creativity our beauty and our humanism must be forced now by us upon the universeupon ourselves even spriggs argues that anvthing representative of america as she exists now is a threat to keen the blackman in perpetual bondage psychological and physical even the symbols of american liberty must be destroyed because white americas concept of liberty and justice is a perversion that must be irrevocably shoved out of our existence the statue of libertv must go that bitch must vacate our minds spriggs has no explanations to make to the white world his dialogue is strictly with black people if he incites excites instructs or entertains he does so to and for black people his ability to look at the mirror of life boldly and shamelessly his sensibilitys functioning as an inevitable receptacle of his peoples collective soul makes him one of our spokesmen he is hopefully not preoccupied with merely analyzing and articulating our misery wright baldwin killens and many otherstheir shortcomings asidehave done that fairly competently already he looks at america and sees in her ghettos all of the material conveniences of the western world he observes for instance in a short photographic poem on harlem the jewowned bars barbecue joints and many other enterprises where black people live in squalor finally he reveals that the only thing owned by black people in harlem is death this is the  american experience which molded his sensibility he lives in a period during which millions of people are murdered at random for the preservation of american dollarism sharpeville vitenam santo domingo harlem watts detroit newark and many more places responsibility to see his people move from all things south imposes itself upon him with an unrelenting passion he apparently has a black conscience chauvinism it depends on what the reader of spriggs relates to after all even the oppressor taught him that cleanliness begins at home he is far from being sentimental he expresses the collective soul of the ghetto and tries to give direction because he is inherently part and parcel of the moving black mass he does not appeal to the conscience of white america because white america has no conscience instead he appeals to his people to pray not for the poet saints pray instead saints for his critics the critics of course are the white murderers who want to control everything including the black poets creativity but spriggs creativity cannot be checked by adolescent fascists disguised as literary critics because he is the bearer of truth spriggs asserts a poet must  would give truth substance  form truth needs a second career so crack the other side black poet that it be felt that it be looked at  into    evidently poets like spriggs know the truth is essentially the poets business spriggs also believes that after the poet has stood truth on her feet again unveiled unadulterated a lot of cleaning up remains to be done the western white man has made the world a filthy place because of the damage done by the western white man the blackman is even alienated from himself so in order that the job ahead be done efficiently ? black poets must make sons quick using magic substances  black poets must make soul anew  must crack the pods  let the semen fly     must carve epitaphs on their volume  numbers spriggs seems to have undergone a psychological and creative rebirth he got rid of the western bourgeois esthetic he is then a modern day witchdoctor whose art and expression are a way of life pulsating with love of life and love since he cannot relate to it he rejects the white frame of reference he was programmed into from the very first day he went to kindergarten he seems to have established a new frame of referenceghettooriented because the black community in a whitedominated society is what he directly relates to spriggs language is free is full of the free ghetto cadence and colorful beauty is afroamerican is delicately sensitive even in the midst of his unrelenting fury is mystic is magical is movingnot in search of but in the assertion and restoration of truth is present like the condition that molded his mind truth is presenthappening languagepulse is heart is myth is vatic is poetry poetry like any other art form is meaningless that is has no use beauty and good inseparableunless it be a specific act actual as dance or childbirth carved bleeding from history our experience tears scorched to deep tracks on the mine laborers back recording the national epitaph walls and what shapes people your memory clarity is not a thought process but a way of life there are many many more young men and women with a sense of mission across these united states you might run into some of them in small magazines like negro digest soulbook black dialogue the journal of black poetry freedomways liberator presence africaine transition the back issues of black orpheus and the new african yet others you might run into only at poetry readings in harlem or newark or some other black community across this country these are transitional men and women moving to the elemental rhythms of our time transitional because they are trying in our time through their rhythms to deniggerfy us to bathe our pulse in revolutionary passions attempting as leroi jones would sing to look into black skulls and teach white people their death but before one can be most effectively instrumental in freeing a people he must first himself be free so that he strives to assert and live up to what he has and its possibilities not what he in frustration desires to have one looks forward to a period when the majority of these young poets abandon mannerism and get directly involved in very concrete community action when the state of black desire becomes an everyday act to satisfy that desire and split the skies with human and humanistic possibilities they will be free then like their rhythms and so will be the rest of us the rhythms coming directly from the way we live then we will join nina simone and sing and now we are one let my soul rest in peace at last it is done my soul has been renewed     
thet will help you to believe 
you are learning now about the american revolution the declaration of independence the founding fathers and the constitution and each morning in class you place your hand over your heart and pledge allegiance to the flag and to country of your birth and it all has meaning for you you are an american and that proud heritage represented by the events and documents and words you are learning is your heritage but soon you will begin to learn other things things which inevitably will leave you in a quandary things which will force you to call into question the meaning of the events and documents and words you have treasured you will learn that for you the heritage in which you have had pride also has emptiness and the knowledge will break your heart we who are older who have traveled the way you must go have not yet found a method of sparing you that heartbreak we want you to believe what you are learning now for the passions and the principles which brought into being the american revolution the declaration of independence and the constitution represent humankind at its noblest we want you to believe in these things even as we concede in sadness that you will need strength beyond what we can give you to hold on to your belief in the world that awaits you
