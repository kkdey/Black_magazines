mron karenga is a spokesman highly endowed not only with the power to rap in a manner black but with a cois severely systematic this means it is possible to read a succession of declarations on art for instance that require no more space than three pages and gain at the same time a definitive introduction to his thought his powers of compression are no less remarkable and are eloquently spoken for by the fact that the entire text which is entitled the quotable karenga and which covers at least seven major areas requires no more than thirty pages also due to close philosophical kinship to both malcolm_x and to leroi jones his remarks help to clarify by their wealth of implications far more than his own distinctive position that position being black cultural nationalism nationalism be it black or white must by its very nature conceive of revolution as a public rather than a personal event as a result individualism is one of its primary objects of attack and diversity one of its first casualties this initial attack is prompted by a sincere desire for unity and reasonably enough public minded movements have never been content to pursue unity without also seeking to control the people they would unify therefore no one should be surprised that karengas opening remark on art is a simple declaration of social control over it black art must be for the people by the people and from the people that is to say it must be functional collective and committing this is a very important premise for the last three words are used at a later point to explain what art must be in order to be revolutionary in addition we learn that all art is the reflection of the values of the people this is understood in such a way as to allow karenga to dismiss individuality and the concept of art for arts sake now this dismissal of these two concepts is partly explained by a general concern for what might be  continued from page  called renegade brothers those who reach for what is thought to be above the heads and interests of the general black public sometimes this reaching out and beyond is hasty careless and in a certain sense selfdestructive because of the bland unexamined values that often support it and karenga like malcolm and jones has a number of penetrating things to say about mixedup values but it should be admitted that part of this singular striving is also due to honest dissent to bringing ones own values and attitudes not to mention those of ones community ones black community into serious question but more significantly it is the effort to go ones own way to follow ones personal bent ones individual path there is a very subtle link between the question of individuality and the notion of art for its own sake it is taken for granted that there is a relationship between the two what that relationship is however is another matter it is usually reduced to subjectivism which is scandalous enough to those critics who insist on defining everything in social terms charges of artificiality and decadence are also popular objections with regard to the nature of art karengas two key words are collective and functional and he is being very shrewd in making them so the first term has to do with origin art is seen as the product of the people all art should be the product of a creative need and desire in terms of black people and again all art reflects the value system from which it comes it should be noted that function and origin are related especially when the purpose is said to derive from the needs of a people black people of course in this case any artist who believes this does considerable violence to his calling and it would be a very serious matter were it not for the miraculous wonderinspiring resilience of art to which the much abused notion of art for arts sake is a very stubborn witness this notion declares nothing less than the selfdetermination and the selfsufficiency of art it is one way of confronting us with the powerful suggestion that what makes us alive and what makes us artists is one and the same force it is another way of saying that art makes the artist rather than the other way around it does so by allowing him to tap his own inner resources and one consideration that should be kept in as steady a focus as possible is the meaning of individuality for there is no better way of calling attention to the irrelevance of bringing up the issue of subjectivity and collectivity more popularly called objectivity  individuality means wholeness the sort of indivisibility one associates with the classic notion of an atom collective and subjective refer to the relative point from which reality is to be viewed individuality on the other hand is concerned with reality itself and not with the position from which we may view it it is a level and an order of reality beyond which one simply cannot go like a real atom it can not be reduced any further it is a matter of foundation and anchorage and art itself furnishes the artist with a self a new self just as a guitar or a piano grants new fingers it makes one conscious of a true and sobering individuality and its initial work its initial relationship to the artist reveals itself to be a most rigorous severe exacting sweeping and delightful as well as thoroughgoing system of a truly radical reorientation both for the artist and for us the audience ray charles not only sings the blues he is also the product of the blues that is to say he is the product the extoller the champion the creation of his own art form and his music which is also our music without the necessity of regimenting him allows for a number of things it allows him to be a man it does so by allowing him to be a real individual this it does by not only allowing him to tap his own vocal resources but also by transforming his blindness and his whole body as well if you really want revolutionary change here it is the spectacle the drama of a man changed and charged and turned into the mysterious power of a vocabulary and a grammar called the blues a whole language in fact somethings got a hold of me it must be art if its a musician thats being grabbed art takes care of its own just as it takes care of us administering to the spot where we need to be moved and stirred the need which drives aretha to sing to moan to shout is identical in source to what drives us to hear her now these are real live needs and her art attends to hers no less than to ours talk about function and change and what do we think puts this art and these artists before us as vital resources for us life there are some people who need coltrane more urgently than a drink so karenga must be mistaken when he suggests that black artists should go around following the people the case would almost appear to be the reverse but not quite for both artist and audience go around following pursuing hungering for what keeps and makes them both alive persons who regard the social aspect of a humans reality as the whole story or as the most significant part cannot be blamed for their misguided efforts to apply an external rather than this native function to art since it can hardly occur to them that art has its own natural inherent builtin reason for being which is to liberate by being lifegiving and lifewitnessing and therefore a reflection of life now if art really went about as karenga and jones insist simply docilely following the people and what they take their needs to be there would be little chance of liberating them the notion that we are merely social beings is part of the chaos from which art has the power to free us and the notions which people bring to all the vital areas of life are in reality part of the deadly folly in which men black and white individualists and nationalists are forever perishing all people spend endless effort artists included in resisting the truth about their lives this question of the selfsufficiency of art and its connection with revolution cannot be overstressed art is inherently revolutionary part of its real force as a criticism of people and society is derived in part from its very diversity it is no accident that karenga harps on the values of the people he takes pains to do so in such a way as to suggest they are familiar to all indisputable and above all simple the needs of the people receive the same shortchanged treatment in the utterances of malcolm stokely carmichael and jones negroes are ruthlessly streamlined and standardized for convenient oversimplification theres nothing like it for enhancing ones persuasiveness but art with its diversity of points of view always manages to reveal people to be far more complex and various than we are otherwise willing to admit or to face for we seldom know quite what to do with this disturbing complexity this unneat unpredictableness human nature surprises and trips us up both jones and karenga stress change and movement this is central to their understanding of what a revolution should accomplish this is also central to an artist why else is the artist forever talking about freedom he needs freedom to move and freedom assumes an order of diversity in art that bewilders even the artist but the relevant point is this art is inherently revolutionary because the change it requires not to mention the changes it requires of the artist himself and the nature of that change is transformation it is also essentially personal rather than political and by being personal it is therefore at bottom religious which takes us to karengas real objection to the blues our creative motif must be revolution all art that does not discuss or contribute to revolutionary change is invalid that is why the blues are invalid they teach resignation in a word acceptance of realityand we have come to change reality this is a very curious position to be backed into it would surely relieve some of the absurdity if karenga would only allow just enough individuality to justify accepting so personal an attitude as resignation then he wouldnt be forced into the even more untenable position of rejecting so major a part of the peoples value system as the blues it would certainly behoove him to accept just enough reality to enable his objection to the blues to constitute a real objection shouldnt he accept just enough reality to come by some real alternatives to real resignation but it would never do for a person determined not to accept reality to accept real standards with which to replace the one he really doesnt like but of course karenga hasnt real reality in mind but simply a social one that is to say he has only a real part instead of the real whole so he can perhaps be forgiven nor is it his fault that he rejects his peoples past ways and past thinking a black nationalist can not escape assuming his peoples sense of reality is unreal how else could he reasonably define as his goal the establishment and the development of a culture for his people without first rejecting as mistaken the stubborn belief that black people already have a culture a tradition of which both the negros speech and abundant musical expression are a definitive and irrefutable part it is instructive to remember that karengas views are no random affair they are rigorously achieved and arrived at they form inevitable parts of a system that system being black cultural nationalism we now come to the third and final element which forms his criteria for an art that would be revolutionary in addition to being collective and functional black art must be committing this term turns out to be not a third element at all because to insist that art is to be revolutionary is simply another way of saying it is to be committed to revolution and knowing that art is to be collective we can assume that commitment cannot be a matter of personal choice since black art is accountable to what is called the people and apparently under their control any art whether black nationalist or not which has the misfortune to be so collective as to allow for no individuality must be totally impersonal as well and therefore a perfect paternalistic formula and framework for black slavery and black suicide and by way of conclusion let us refocus on this element of paternalism for it is the most characteristic and widespread feature to be found in the rhetoric of all sorts of spokesmen for black revolution not only artists renegade or otherwise but the people too who get flattered and burdened with so much tyrannical power are treated in this manner we all are we all are looked upon and regarded by our socalled black liberators as so many sheep there is a serious problem here among these our own revolutionaries they seem to have a serious case of shepherdcomplex and it is a tragedy for a people such as we to have produced a generation of youth who seem on the evidence so utterly indifferent to what all the fuss has always been about who no longer remember that revolution is aimed at freedom not control not regimentation not a mass of afroheaded robots but freedom and the black artists who jump into such a constricting bag for the sake of unity have surely placed themselves in a black straitjacket and with their mouths wide open to swallow a black mans cup of hemlock
mitting or committed since this is traditionally valid it stands to reason that we should attempt to use it as the foundation for a rational construction to meet our present day needs and by no mere coincidence we find that the criteria is not only valid but inspiring that is why we say that all black art irregardless of any technical requirements must have three basic characteristics which make it revolutionary in brief it must be functional collective and committing it must be functional that is useful as we cannot accept the false doctrine of art for arts sake for in fact there is not such thing as art for arts sake all art reflects the value system from which it comes  for if the artist created only for himself and not for others he would lock himself up somewhere and paint or write or play just for himself but he does not do that on the contrary he invites us over even insists that we come to hear him or to see his work in a word he expresses a need for our evaluation andor appreciation and our evaluation cannot be a favorable one if the work of art is not first functional that is useful so what then is the use of art our art black art black art must expose the enemy praise the people and support the revolution it must be like leroi jones poems that are assassins poems poems that kill and shoot guns and wrassle cops into alleys taking their weapons leaving them dead with  tongues pulled out and sent to ireland it must be functional like the poem of another revolutionary poet from us clyde halisi who described the masters words as sun genies dancing through the crowd snatching crosses and st christophers from around niggers necks and passing the white gapped legs in their minds to simbas  to be disposed of or in terms of painting we do not need pictures of oranges in a bowl or trees standing innocently in the midst of a wasteland if we must paint oranges and trees let our guerrillas be eating those oranges for strength and using those trees for cover we need new images and oranges in a bowl or fat white women smiling lewdly cannot be those images all material is mute until the artist gives it a message and that message must be a message of revolution then we have destroyed art for arts sake which is of no use anyhow and have developed art for all our sake art for mose the miner sammy the shoeshine boy t c the truck driver and k p the unwilling soldier in conclusion the real function of art is to make revolution using its own medium the second characteristic of black art is that it must be collective in a word it must be from the people and must be returned to the  people in a form more beautiful and colorful than it was in real life for that is what art is everyday life given more form and color and in relationship to that the black artist can find no better subject than black people themselves and the black artist who does not choose or develop this subject will find himself unproductive for no one is any more than the context to which he owes his existence and if an artist owes his existence to the afroamerican context then he also owes his art to that context and therefore must be held accountable to the people of that context to say that art must be collective however raises four questions number one the question of popularization versus elevation two personality versus individuality three diversity in unity and four freedom to versus freedom from the question of popularization versus elevation is an old one what it really seeks to do is to ask and to answer the question whether or not art should be lowered to the level of the people or the people raised to the level of art our contention is that if art is from the people and for the people there is no question of raising people to art or lowering art to the people for they are one and the same thing as we said previouslyart is everyday life given more form and color and what one seeks to do then is to use art as a means of educating the people and being educated by them so that it is a mutual exchange rather than a oneway communication art and people must develop at the same time and for the same reason it must move with the masses and be moved by the masses for we should not demand that our people go to school to learn to appreciate art but that an artist go to school formally or informally to learn new and better techniques of expressing his appreciation for the people and all they represent and his disdain for anything and everything that threatens or hinders their existence then and only then can both the artist and the people move forward with a positive pace rooted to the reality of revolution the second question raised is the question of personality versus individuality now this question is one of how much the emphasis on collective art destroys the individuality of the artist we say that individualism is a luxury that we cannot afford moreover individualism is in effect nonexistent for since no one is any more than the context to which he owes his existence he has no individuality only personality individuality by definition is me in spite of everyone and personality is me in relation to everyone the one a useless isolation and the other an important involvement we have heard it even said that the individual is like an atom that which can no longer be reduced or the essence of humanity however aside from this being a rather strained analogy it does not prove that a man who wants to be an individual can stand alone for the atom itself is a part of a molecule and cannot exist without interdependence and even then it is at best a simple theoretical construction for the convenience of conversation we say that there is no virtue in a false independence but there is value in a real interdependence the third question raised with regard to collective art is an extension of the second one and that is does unity preclude diversity our answer to that is an emphatic no for there can be and is unity in diversity even as there can be diversity in unity what one seeks however is not a standardization of every move or creation but a framework in which one can create and avoid the european gift of trial and error one can seek the reality of the concept of diversity in unity or unity in diversity in listening to a trippin ensemble in a trippin ensemble the leader sets the pace and others come in or go out as it pleases them but in the end they all come to a very dynamic and overwhelmingly harmonious conclusion so it is with our dance two partners dance together the same dance and yet they provide us with a demonstration of that which is unique in each of them but that is not individualitythat is personality for it is an expression of uniqueness not isolation from but in relation to each other and the collective experience that they both have shared the last question is one of freedom to versus freedom from this is really a political question or social one and is one that raises contradiction for the artist who rejects the social interpretation of art however when he demands freedom to do something or freedom from the restriction that prohibits his doing something he is asking for a sociopolitical right and that as we said makes art social first and aesthetic second art does not exist in the abstract just like freedom does not exist in the abstract it is not an independent living thing it lives through us and through the meaning and message we give it and an artist may have any freedom to do what he wishes as long as it does not take the freedom from the people to be protected from those images words and sounds that are negative to their life and development the people give us the freedom from isolation and alienation and random searching for subject matter and artists in view of this must not ask for freedom to deny this but on the contrary must praise the people for this in conclusion the concept of collective art can best be expressed in the african proverb showing the interdependence of all by saying one hand washes the other the final thing that is characteristic of black art is that it must be committing it must commit us to revolution and change it must commit us to a future that is ours in a word it must commit us to all that is usyesterday today and the sunrise of tomorrow it must tell us like halisis poem maulana and word magic that we must give up the past or be found out and exposed as the notes of a new day come tripping through searching each ones heart for any traces of pevton place it must commit us  to the fact that the earth is ours and the fullness thereof as leroi jones says you cant steal nothing from the white man hes already stole it he owes you anything you want even his life so black people take the shit you want take their lives if need but get what you want what you need dance up and down the street turn all the music up this is commitment to the struggle a commitment that includes the artist and the observer we cannot let each other rest there is so much to do and we all know we have done so little art will revive us inspire us give us enough courage to face another disappointing day it must not teach us resignation for all our art must contribute to revolutionary change and if it does not it is invalid therefore we say the blues are invalid for they teach resignation in a word acceptance of reality and we have come to change reality we will not submit to the resignation of our fathers who lost their money their women and their lives and sat around wondering what did they do to be so black and blue we will say again with brother leroi we are lovers and the sons of lovers and warriors and the sons of warriors therefore we will loveand unwillingly though necessarily make war revolutionary war we will not cry for those things that are gone but find meaning in those things that remain with us perhaps people will object violently to the idea that the blues are invalid but one should understand that they are not invalid historically they will always represent a very beautiful musical and psychological achievement of our people but today they are not functional because they do not commit us to the struggle of today and tomorrow but keep us in the past and whatever we do we cannot remain in the past for we have too much at stake in the present and we find our future much too much rewarding to be rejected let our art remind us of our distaste for the enemy our love for each other and our commitment to the revolutionary struggle that will be fought with the rhythmic reality of a permanent revolution
there is a spirit of revolution abroad in the shadowy world  of letters in black america not all black writers are attuned i f to it of course and some are even opposed to it which is  to be expected also one supposes great change is always terrifying especially to those who have found niches in the established structure and wish to remain secure but change is upon us there is therefore a wide divergence of opinion among black writers as to their role in society as to their role in the black revolution as to their role as artistsall these considerations tied into and touching on the others negro digest polled some  black writers both famous and unknown asking the  questions which are published on page  the questions elicited from the writers opinions relative to the books and writers which have influenced them the writers who are most important to them in terms of achievement and promise and what they think about the new movement toward a black aesthetic and the preoccupation with the black experience aspects of the larger black consciousness movement the replies from the writers are extraordinarily rich and no attempt will be made in this issue of the magazine to collate and analyze all the material rather pertinent statements from the questionnaires are published on these pages dealing primarily with the last dozen questions along with a general essay intended as background and summary
richard wright once wrote that both black and white americans resist facing the truth of the racist nature of this country a statement which on the face of it does not seem so profound and vet it is at the beginning of  with at least half a dozen various government and private agencies engaged in studying the causes of upheaval in the cities the sharpness of richard wrights insight falls into focus both black and white americans accept the proposition after  years together in this land that it is necessary to spend millions of dollars hold dozens of hearings and engage the services of platoons of sociologists and myriad other social scientists in order to determine why black americans are raising unholv hell m  against the conditions of their lives which white americans have forced upon them and richard wright also understood why black americans cling more desperately than white americans to the rules of the game of illusion the game is easier to play for whiles after all they have all the advantages and guilt and a nagging feeling of indecency however uncomfortable at times are bearable black americans on the other hand have no defenses at all beyond their flimsy veil once that is torn away and they must confront the reality of what they are and of their collaboration against their own humanity they will have no alternative but to act but actiongenuine effective actionis w what thev fear most in succumb« ing to the rage and bitterness which are the natural fruits of their degraded existence thev would face the ultimate dangersimprisonment or death and of course thev cannot do that they have   made the other choice they have chosen to live however dishonorably and they have found a million w  wavs of rationalizing the failure to act the refusal to end the limitations other men have placed on their freedom richard wrights knowledge of the truth about americans was the strength of his work or as many of his critics would argue its weakness for these critics would no forgive him for not diluting his rage and clarity in obscurity of saunders reddings distinguished career as professor and author spans more years than many of the writers polled have been alive and of course unlike many of the younger writers mr redding is familiar with an extraordinary range of literature his answers to the questions naturally reflect his solid base in traditional literary approaches and attitudes mr redding is one of the living writers who was personally acquainted with richard wright and mr redding has no doubts that the later works of the late richard wright suffered because in his european exile wright had lost touch with the living american reality and wright himself thought so too mr redding says saunders redding  does mr redding see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic no not in america besides aesthetics has no racial national or geographical boundaries beauty and truth the principal components of aesthetics are universal and should the black writers journey toward art lead through exploitation of the black experience the journey should carry the writerblack or whitethrough the familiar country of his mind and heart through what he knows best and feels most mr redding grew impatient with the question as to what is the most important novel written by a black writer since invisible man again youre asking for absolutes and damn it in this business there are no absolutes except in a negative sense theres no such thing as the most important novel and theres been no really good novel by a negro in years mr redding also said that there have been no important black playwrights in this or any other centurynot in americaalice walker a very talented young woman out of rural georgia has been fantastically busy in the past few years but has now settled down in mississippi for serious work like samuel allen she finds both john a williams and mari evans among the promising and important writers and she thinks the man who cried i am is probably the most important novel by a black writer since invisible man as to whether black writers should direct their work toward black audiences miss walker replies black writers should direct their work towards an audience some imaginary ideal audience that will appreciate what they have to say novelist as the most important black american writer of all time there was no attempt by n egro digest to poll only those writers who have published books or to exclude those whose ideas are different from the editors and so the writers represented here cover the whole ranse of creativitv from those authors highly esteemed by the literary establishment to those who arc known only to a small coterie of local readers some of the writers are grandparents and others are barely in their twenties unsurprisingly then there are contrasting and conflicting viewpoints and the distance between the educational qualifications of the respondents is sometimes very great indeed generallv the older writers and profit from it to write solely for a black audience is limiting and presumes too much that they will appreciate your efforts that they will try to understand you that they will care enough about your work to buy your books and that white people could never get anything be made better one might say from what one writes my own family has squashed my illusions that black audiences are more perceptive or moved more than white ones the only time they will read my material is when l send it to them i think it is only important that we write from within ourselves and that we direct our efforts outward period i would have liked for victor hugo to like my stories quite as much as i admire his one of the younger writers whose work most of which is as yet unpublished shows uncommon talent carolyn rodgers replied yes of course to the question do you see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic  and her reply to the question should black writers direct  their work toward black audiences was eloquently simple yes when they want to and no when they dont want to and ultimately they always will when the realization comes that the only audience which will listen to anything that takes guts to be said is a black audience
charles wright an alumnus of the handy school where james jones wrote his first novel from here to eternity is author of two published novels the messenger and the wig mr wright is unknown as individual and as author to most black readers and indeed to other black writers although his two novels received favorable notices it came as a surprise and perhaps also as revelation to have mr wright suggest the novel the confessions of nat turner by william styron as a book dealing with the negros role in history which is recommended for study by negro children the literary value of mr styrons novel aside most black writers have reservations about the book and some black writers have reacted violently against it beacon press will publish a collection of essays by black writers dealing with mr styrons work which incidentally has received only race reviews in the white press mr wright answers hellno to the question of whether richard wright had lost touch with the living american reality in his european exile however he does not think that the black writer should deliberately direct his work toward black audiences nor does he feel that the black writers journey toward art should lead deliberately through exploitation of the black experience  as to whether there is a future for the idea of a black aesthetic mr wright says perhaps
julian mayfield returned to the united states recently after several years in africa and europe an able novelist he has not been represented by a published work since his third novel the grand parade  mr mayfield who is working on a new novel is a teaching fellow at cornell university perhaps surprisingly mr mayfield agrees that richard wright lost touch with the living american reality by remaining in exile and mr mayfield is one of the experienced authors who did not select richard wright as one of the three most important black american writers of all time he named w e b du bois james baldwin and ralph ellison in that order mr mayfield was tothepoint in his reply to the question as to whether the black writers journey toward art should lead through exploitation of the black experience a silly question of course what other experience is he the black writer going to have mr mayfield believes that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences even if they cannot persuade black people to buy writing by blacks to mr mayfield there have been no novels bv black writers worth mentioning since publication of invisible man to a younger more militant poet as a racist and a nazi because of the unadulterated hatred expressed toward white americans in the younger poets recent work the older poet points out quite logically that racism is just as stultifying from blacks as it is from whites and yet the older poet admits the power and beauty of the younger poets work without also admitting its poetic honesty the essential question it would seem is this are not black people in america systematically and literally murdered and degraded by white racism and arc not rage and bitterness and hatred perfectly natural and legitimate responses to this murder and degradation is the hatred of the jews for their nazi executioners merely equivalent to the germans hatred of the jews for their jewishness but back to the poll the second choice as most important black writer was langston hughes although the late poetplaywriglu edged out james baldwin and ralnh kllison bv only a    few votes baldwin and ellison were evenly matched and web du bois had the next largest number of votes the third choice as most important hack writer was james r   i f    j     t    conrad kent rivers is a poet whose work has appeared in nearly all the recent anthologies of poetry by black authors sometime in the near future paul breman will publish a collection of mr rivers poems in london currently on leave from teaching duties in the metropolitan chicago area mr rivers is trying his hand at freelancing and intensive work on a major project the system of dantes hell by leroi jones is mr rivers choice as the most important novel by a black writer since invisible man and novelist ronald fair gets his vote as the most promising young novelist mr rivers feels that richard wright did lose touch to a degree during his exile but his techniques continued to improve is there a future for the black aesthetic idea yes the only hope we must create a black aesthetic must the black writer exploit the black experience to achieve art it is only through our exploitation of our experience that our vision and our ventures will ring true for the literate should black writers direct their work toward black audiences we must being there first our literature is our legacy if we fail to write for black people wein effectfail to write at all
keorapetse william kgositsile is a refugee from south africa known affectionately as willie among his friends and acquaintances because it is difficult at first to learn to pronounce his name mr kgositsile has the advantage of being familiar with many african writers unknown in america but he also is very much a part of the contemporary black writers scene in america mr kgositsile does not believe that richard wrights work suffered because he had lost touch with the living american reality he sees other reasons why that work suffered  believe that his wrights later works suffered because he became concerned with humanity instead of specifically black people humanity is a tricky abstraction and the establishment of a black aesthetic is the only future the black writer has in mr kgositsiles opinion there is no other way it could be if the art reflects and reflects upon the lives of black people the point of view of black writers is black and their experience as black people colors their ethics and aesthetics if they are honest people should the black writers journey toward art lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience through honest involvement with the black experience a writers language that is his images rhythms earliest memories and so forth come from his peoples experiencereal or imagined and art like clothing belongs specifically to a people and is identifiable that way should black writers direct their work toward black audiences yes they should they must unless they are schizophrenic l dont think the question even arises every selfrespecting artist addresses himself to his people

to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences poet margaret danner replied a writer should write what he feels and yet i believe that we should help each other if our talent is writing we can help in this wayby deliberately directing some of our work toward black audiences because of the predicament that the black man is in and faces those of us who are black should unite to extricate ourselves and each other do you believe that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience i believe and have tried for many years to do something positive about this conviction that the black should be awakened to his vast beauty he will then be so enthusiastic that he will automatically write of the experience and is there a future for the black aesthetic to the extent that this group includes those who have proven similar intentions by accepting and utilizing their help i feel that their exclusion of interested lovers of black is a hindrance 
jean wheeler smith is a detroiter who reversed the usual arrangement by making a life in mississippi her deep involvement in the civil_rights movement during snccs most dramatic days in the south had a lot to do with her making that decision and finding the strength to follow it mrs smith has published short stories and a moving autobiographical statement in a national women s magazine and she is now working to complete her first novel mrs smith does not feel competent to judge whether richard wright lost touch in his european exile  never studied wrights works chronologically i think i read a range of his works though and to me theyre good over the years mrs smiths reply to the question of whether the concept of the black aesthetic has a future was refreshing im not sure i know what the term means i do think though that writing about things because theyre black and need to be recorded is legitimate for a few years and then later on a minor scale after the record has been made  think the literature will have to be good just because it is good and makes its point that doesnt mean it wont still be about being black she believes the black experience should be exploited by black writers seeking art i think that the black experience has great historical and social significance for black and white people and it should be the focus of black writing where the writers temperament and background permit should black writers then direct their work toward black audiences yes anything you write for white audiences probably isnt going to do you and other black people much good except if you get get paid well for doing itwhich is another matter what you write for white folks is probably going backward or at most remaining stationary since all you can do for them is explain what already happened instead of explore new ways for things to happenor at least new ways and useful in the struggle of looking at what happened john wideman is a former football hero and rhodes scholar whose first novel a glance a way received generally good notices last fall mr wideman admitted that he is unfamiliar with that school of black writers which seeks to establish the black aesthetic  and pretended not to know the meaning of the black experience he had not read richard wrights work and had no opinions on which writers and books were important explained mr wideman sometimes i havent sampled enough of the relevant writing at other times i just react negatively to any such popularity polls the only interesting aspect of opinion is the ground upon which it is based the skeletal history of preferences retains only an arbitrary hierarchy to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences mr widemans reply was a sharp one if thats the best they can do or what they want to do
what about the future of the black aesthetic idea if by a black aesthetic you mean art and literature which is blackoriented i would say yes it has a future and l would say the word writers is too restrictive black creative artists i feel would more aptly serve as the black creative artist applies to his own works the discriminating standards of excellence by which he judges the works of others and as he remains involvedas do all artists with self and situation regardless of the manner of projection he will inevitably create a mystique in which excellence craftsmanship and blackness have interfused miss evans had some provocative things to say about black poets and craft if black poets share a fault it may be that we are through with a poem before it is crafted many black poets have excellent material but are evidently too impatient to wait for the results they could get this is true of aspiring white poets also but since being published is more of an achievement for a black writer the published work of a black poet is accorded a status it might not receive if he were white robert hayden is a craftsman leroi jones not only crafts but also has something to say and ted joans has a sincerity which transcends any weakness in crafting leroi jones i feel is important the other two are simply able poets as i see it   should black writers direct their work toward black audiences some things should be said at home and some in the marketplace black writers should decide whether what they have to say needs to be said to white or black folks and attempt to market their work accordingly there are some other things whitey needs to be toldand some things the brother needs to hear   
there was a long period between publication of her poem for my people and publication of her novel jubilee when readers saw little of the work of margaret walker and she was missed apparently the poet had parceled her time among three important endeavors rearing her children teaching and researching and writing her long novel now she is being seen and heard again asked if black writers should direct their work toward black audiences miss walker replied in the affirmative who else can verify what is writ   ten or identify with the work writers should not write exclusivlv for black or white audiences but most inclusively after all it is the business of all writers to write about the human condition and all humanity must be involved both in the writing and in the reading is there a future for those writers who want to establish a black aesthetic why not the black aesthetic r has a rich if undiscovered past this goes back in time to the beginning of civilization in egypt babylonia india china persia and all the islamic world that precedes the renaissance of the europeans we have lived too long excluded by the anglosaxon aesthic as to whether the black writer should exploit the black experience in the journey toward art miss walker was eloquent where else should the journey lead the black writer is the black experience how can the human experience transcend humanity its the same thingalternating desire for assimilation and separation but the division is both deeper and more subtle than that there are those writers who arc committed to the truth as reflected through the prism of their own experiences and of their total heritage and there are those writers who have adjusted their vision and their goals to the guidelines established by people who not only do not share with them crucial life experiences but who in effect are historically and culturally placed in a position which demands that the validity of the unshared experiences be denied all the writers polled here say that black writersand all writers should direct their work towards truth it is like coming out for god and motherhood but whose truth and who is to judge whether truth has been achieved clearly some of the w riters have set out on an independent course shucking the chains the literary
young s e sam anderson is one of the few under writers who believe that richard wright lost touch with the livins ameriw can reality in his european exile a merica went through some very significant changes visavis black people and one would have had to be here to really dig upon the sophistication and institutionalization and acculturation of racism against blacks at home and abroad aesthetic what alice ch  january  negro digest the journey toward art mr anderson believes should lead through a conscious and deliberate exploration of the black experience real art is life or a mirror of life or an improver on life and since people are life and since they live in a society then art must be in our case black first and socially educational should black writers direct their work toward black audiences we are an oppressed people what is therefore needed is a revolution a revolution of self family society nation values culture the black writer including the cinema photographer radio dj and photographerjournalist must necessarily aid in the liberation struggle he cannot aid by talking black songs and programs to the enemy ofayswhites he must talk and listen and talk and help black people this will not only aid the liberation but also help perpetuate black art and humanistic art in other words in the process of directing his work toward black people he is creating a new man a new humanism unlike the pallid and selfcentered old humanism of the exploitive west
ulia fields who returned to the south north carolina after living in new york city is a winner of a national endowment for the arts grant for this season the young writer believes that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences and this work should be at the service of the peopleart for the peoples sake it ought not to be schoolmarm stuff or dinner and a show stuff for unreffective bored people that leaves out the majority of black peoplea truly vast audience the real problem at this time ought to be how shall we reach black audiences miss fields comments on the question of the black aesthetic the negro caravan is read by people who have not heard of recent literature in the future the only relevant literature will be that a which has gone directly to the heart of blackness as to whether the black writers journey toward art should lead irected toward humanity which is indisputable but when humanity is interpreted as wearing a white face then what is the black writers alternative if the black audience does not constitute humanity then what audience does on page  of this magazine is a quote from a review by louis simpson a white poet of gwen through exploitation of the black experience  miss fields had some specific footnotes to add to her reply the black experience seems the most intense experience in the modern world it is better that black people write it ourselves rather than have it written for us exploitativelv the exploitatively is a reference to the three white writers miss fields selected as most important william styron robert penn warren and allen tate all southerners in excellent standing said miss fields by their good literary fortune they remind us that they are still assumed to understand blacks better than blacks understand themselves 
woodie king jr is a young playwright out of detroit now living in new york city and working through mobilization for youths with young people interested in the theater arts he is founder of the ¦ it is not  generation  january  negro digest  i   t      a    i concept east theater in detroit where his first plays were produced and he once toured universities performing in malcolm boyds plays mr king also writes stories and is working on a novel mr king does not agree that richard wrights later works suffered because wright lost touch with the living american reality by remaining in europe he feels that wrights works suffered because he had money and security and did not live close to the lifeline in both europe and america mr king also feels there is a future for writers of the black aesthetic school because more black people are going to be reading because of the rise in education and the new leisure black writers should direct their work toward black audiences mr king feels he also thinks that john a williams the man who cried  am is the most important novel by a black american writer since invisible man and that leroi jones is about  miles ahead of the next living poet 
ernest j gaines published his second novel of love and dust last fall and will be represented by a collection of his short stories in the spring relatively unknown on the writers conference circuit he nevertheless is highly regarded by his fellow writers he lives in san francisco but wants to return to his native louisiana to research an important novel he intends to write mr gaines agrees with those who feel that richard wright lost touch with the living american exile by remaining so long abroad wright was a man of strong passionnot an intellectual he had to get his material out of the american soil not out of a european library mr gaines response to the question of whether there is a future in the black aesthetic concept as long as they black writers write about people people people people and not just about problems and should the journey toward art lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience ive always said that a man black writer or not should do what he can do best should black writers direct their work toward black audiences no more than french writers should the artist is the only free man left he owes nobody nothingnot even himself he should write what he wants when he wants and to whomever he wants if he is true he will use that material which is closest to him those people who have experienced much of what he the artist has will see themselves in his work if they dont then no amount of preaching by the artist will do any good 
robert boles background has been markedly different from that of most of the writers whose opinions are published here he grew up in the relatively more enlightened east traveled extensively under privileged circumstances and was removed by circumstance from the center of the racial w hirlpool in america and yet his published works show very clearly that he has not stood clear of the maelstrom his first novel was the people one knows and one of his stories appeared in langston hughes anthology the best short stories by negro americans later this spring his second novel curling will be published mr boles does not feel that richard wrights long stay in europe resulted in wright losing touch with the living american reality as to whether black writers should exploit the black experience in straining toward art mr boles is ambivalent  dont believe that becoming a professional negro benefits art and one does not have to be one a professional negro to write about negroes the negro has enough working against himwhy should he limit his output to the black experience there are other experiences and he does not think that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences black writers should direct their work to the biggest audience they can find to their countrymen and to people all over the world to the question should black writers direct their work toward black audiences gwendolyn brooks replied no they should concern themselves with truth truth should be put upon paper that phrase direct their work suggests a secret contempt for the intelligence of the black audience her reply to the question do you believe that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience  was the following i dont like the use here of the word exploitation but i believe that integrity essential and artistic will require not only involvement with what is known as the black experience but saturation does the famous poet see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish a black aesthetic certainly a most exciting concept because definite because an entity because distinct gwendolyn brooks is the only black poet ever to be honored with a pulitzer prize she has published six books including one novel and recently delivered the manuscript of her seventh book the mecca to her publishers in new york a housewife as well as a distinguished poet miss brooks also has a full schedule as instructor at two chicago colleges chicago teachers college north and columbia college and also doubles as advisor to a group of young writers who meet regularly in her home her published works are selected poems the bean eaters annie allen a street in bronzeville bronxeville boys and girls for children and maud martha the novel like most of the writers polled miss brooks feels that richard wright who lived in chicago during her youth is the most important black writer produced by america in fact she does not feel he has any peers i am not intrigued by any novels written by black writers before or since native son she says like several of the older over writers playwright william b branch displayed a certain amount of impatience with the content and implications of some of the survey questions he declined to state an opinion relative to the questions dealing with most important novelists poets playwrights etc im afraid you lose me with all this most important jazz he said this implies a critical faculty and audacity im not sure i have or want to have asked if he believes the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience mr branch  replied to each his own i for one think a black writer would be foolish to ignore the wealth of material and theme involved in the black experience but i would never confine anyone to it alone art is to be found ultimately in any human experience it depends upon who is doing the looking should black writers direct their work toward black audiences again to each his own though this has long been a subject of speculation and confusion i think ultimately each writer must be allowed to decide for himself there are some writing situations which would demand this others which would not some in which this would be an admirable opportunity others in which it would not m  l think the schizophrenic aspects of a black writer in largely white america have been and still are a crippling load on an already overburdened entity perhaps he can solve this on an imwritingonlyformeandmypeople basis perhaps not  know for me it is a dilemma l must wrestle with each time l try to write sometimes l lean more heavily in one direction sometimes in another hopeful that both black and white audiences will gain some though necessarily differing insight from what results all of this is complicated of course by the unfortunate fact that the black audience reading public book and ticket buyer etc is still a small and largely undeveloped group especially in the theater
john o killens whose second novel and then we heard the thunder was one of the three novels listed as most important since invisible man sided with those who feel that the late richard wright had lost touch with the living american reality in his long european exile said mr killens  think that a couple of his wrights later books such as the long dream reflected a loss of contact with the then black american reality nevertheless he remained to his dying day and to this day the greatest black novelist in the world living or dead despite mr killens opinion that wright had lost contact he still chose a wright novel the outsider as the most important novel by a black writer published since invisible man a ithough there was much in this novel  did not care for in terms of bad writing neverthless the symbolism captured the black mans situation in american life as no other novel has before or after we are essentially outsiders in the land of our birth owing loyalties to no one but our black selves is there a future for the writers seeking to establish a black aesthetic yes  believe that each creative writer must ultimately find that aesthetic which works best for him must find that rhythm that structure that style that idiom which the materials of his art and life dicate to him he ultimately becomes a slave to his aesthetic at the same time his aesthetic becomes the writers slave to be bent to his moods to be broken down from time to time and molded and forged into something new and altogether different at the whims of the writer and to suit the writers artistic purposes the writer is the ruthless exploiter faced with his aesthetic since the materials of most black writers come out of the black experience it would seem that a black aesthetic would be a most viable and fruitful one for the black artist but only if he continually seeks to reach the stage of a langston hughes or a charles white painter where he sees beauty in his be too gloomy a picture to bear with any kind of patience we are in a subservient position    the smallest and the greatest of us we have cajoled pleaded tommed protested achieved rioted defied unified    you name it but white supremacists have dug their heels into the ground and will settle for nothing less than outright confrontation in the streets of america welfare and poverty program are the white powers answer to our demand for freedom meanwhile we feed upon each other and hungrily pick unbuttered crumbs from massas table meanwhile we have no theaters  or any other means of production    and any attempt to buy our own puts us in the position where they can cut off our supply lines via unions and real estate holdings at a moments notice there is no artist among us whose individual success will free the rest of us there is no substitute for human rights    not even art miss childress departed from the specific questions to speak with eloquence and passion about herself black people and america  have ever been in the position of having to study and understand the greatness or meanness of others and of making whatever adjustment is necessary to exist in their world the oppressed forever studying the oppressor    to be oppressed is hard but it is harder yet when one is expected to appreciate it the one who holds me  down tells me how to react to his action in order to survive with his goodwill it is ever painful i do believe that the action of white supremacists have cut us off from the enjoyment and appreciation of the finest white artists    and has benumbed the appreciation on ourselves as a peopleas a whole look to the white society which surrounds our ghettos a white child or adult who has been unloved by a parent neglected in some way or other must be nursed by psychologists for years in order to lead him back to a sense of well being    my god what will it take for us to feel a fraction of that wellbeing  after the hatred and attacks we have been subjected to for centuries    the plaster now slapped on our wounds is welfare and poverty programwhich is another and more subtle attack this society tells us they would rather support us as charity cases than to open the doors and let us win or fail live or die as full citizens of this country if one lacks an appreciative attitude about this then you are bitter    we can be bitter or numb there is no other choice a negro without feeling numb seems to survive a few moments inoger than we who are bitter as to who are the most important white american writers miss childress had the following comments i doubt if i am capable of summing up the best and the greatest food served at other peoples tables i remember best what has somewhat slaked my thirst and eased my hunger pains    people who pity us leave me cold i dont even feel like evaluating walt whitman and i know he was different and new to a great extent and belongs in the company of thoreau    there was only one john brown and one elijah lovejoy but then they werent writers were they
addison gayle jr is one of the few contemporary writers who wins the approval of both the revolutionary and the conservative wings of the black literary world an instructor of english in the prebaccaulaureate program of the city college of new york mr gayles articles and stories have appeared in a number of periodicals mr gayle is emphatic in his disagreement with the contention that richard wrights later works suffered because of his long exile in europe wright lost some of the pow er displayed in native son in his later novel the outsider but two of his most powerful works white man listen and eight men were written abroad however mr gayle does not see any future at all for that school of black writers which seeks to establish the black aesthetic the black aesthetic has always been a part of the lives black people to investigate these lives and the conditions surrounding them is to reveal an aesthetic inherent in the soul of black people nor does mr gayle support the idea that the black writers journey toward art should lead consciously and deliberately through exploitation of the black experience   do not believe in the journey art must always be subordinated to truth and that truth no matter how uncomfortable can not be denied by adhering to romantic criteria proposed by critics who have no cognizance of truth and less of life on the other hand mr gayle does believe that black writers should direct their work toward black audiences serious consideration however must be given to this question perhaps this is where black literature should have first directed itself perhaps wright was wrong in arguing that black people knew about the conditions under which other black people lived and that the w riter should therefore importune white people to listen one may 
editors undoubtedly since white america goes out of its way to make the black man negro feel that he is a part of this country this melting pot why indeed do we need the word negro why do we need ghettoes poor schools substandard housing workless fathers unpublished poets and other accidents of the melting pot and if this melting pot does exist why did blacks get burned so badly mr hayden what are television radio movies newspapers and weekly news magazines if not ideological weaponswhite ideology twentyfour hours a day at every conceivable level white concepts are inforced and reinforced upon black people what we do not need mr hayden is people like you telling us what we need the editor continues his drive against blackness with this assertion a belligerent race pride moves these celebrants of black_power to declare themselves not simply poets but negro poets  i would say a belligerent ignorance moved mr hayden to make such a statement such an ignorance enabled him to use a term like black_power which clearly shows that he has no concept of white power or even of selfpower for that matter an ignorance that should realize that those celebrants of black_power are really in essence celebrants of self of a people of me and yes mr hayden celebrants of you and few if any would reduce themselves to defending a tired overused cliche like black_power obviously the editor is not only out of touch with black poets but wishes to antagonize them by calling them negro poets no such animal when used in that frame of reference exists most if not all of the black poets writing today contend that being a negro is only a state of mind ie just like negroland the editor counters with words from one of the first widely read negro poets countee cullen in which mr cullen states that he be considered a poet not a negro poet for he did not want to be restricted to racial themes nor have his poetry judged solely on the basis of its relevance to the negro struggle first mr cullen and mr hayden continue to perpetuate a very dangerous myth in that they presuppose that poets other than black poets or black critics are qualified to judge black or negro poetry i believe that this is an absurdity to say the least how can one who is not a part of our culture a part of our immediate life a part of us judge us how can they wasp have a proper perspective to work from if there is to be judgment then we as afroamericans are better prepared to pass judgment on them we blacks have a much wider perspective to work from for we are the products of a dual culture ie shakespeare during the day and leroi jones at night or americanism during the day and survival at night  and to john henry you taught us that a man could go down like a man and to you sterling brown you taught that in poetry the people their lifestyle their language and their culture should not be forgotten arna bontemps who is best known for his prose leaves little doubt in my mind to the validity of his poetry he is lyrical and his poems denote a musical quality langston hughes who left us in may of  shows that he is still alive i believe that hayden errs in telling us that mr hughes at his death had the distinction of being the only american negro man of letters able to support himself by writing if i am not mistaken james baldwin has this distinction also langston hughes being one of the most important writers of the century could and should have been better represented i too and jazzonia lead the sad array of his poems i have recently completed his the panther and the lash and know too well that the editor had much more to select from the emasculated countee cullen as one would expect if one was under the influence of robert hillyer john keats and a e housman emasculates most of his poetry even with these handicaps cullens feeling comes through in for a lady i know she even thinks that up in heaven her class lies late and snores while poor black cherubs rise at seven to do celestial chores a shade of light were the poems of frank m davis his sarcasm was biting and left pains try arthur ridgewood md he debated whether as a poet to have dreams and beans or as a physician have a long car and caviar dividing his time between both he died from a nervous breakdown caused by worry from rejection slips and final notices from the finance company i also liked robert whitmore and giles johnson phd of robert haydens poems frederick douglass moved me most owen dodson and margaret danner will be heard dudley randalls booker t and web is printed here which contradicts something dudley once told me about having poems printed and reprinted in anthologies the forementioned poem was in beyond the blues edited by rosey pool margaret walkers for my people continues to stand out as does her lineage and molly means gwendolyn brooks one of my favorites displays her work with all the irony and surprise that is only hers she has a downtoearth use of images and an easy flowing rhythm i espe dally liked negros hero and hunchback girl she thinks of heaven james a emmanuels poems are tight and full as in the negro never saw him never can hypothetical haunting man eyes asaucer yessir bosssir dice aclicking razor flicking theness froze him in a dance aness never had a chance mari evans continues to play with words beautifully naomi madgett and g c oden are ably spoken for as is oliver pitcher ted joans voice in the crowd captures the true meaning of the poet if you should seea manwalking down a crowded streettalking aloudto himself dont runin the opposite direction but run toward himfor he is a poet you have nothing to fearfrom the poet but the truth calvin c herntons young negro poet tells a good story as does his madhouse gerald w barrax and conrad kent rivers are worth reading and rereading leroi jones one of the few black poets in this book is not properly represented most of the poems are from an earlier transitional period and do not reflect his blackness as i am sure leroi would have wanted it mr hayden says that mr jones is an advocate of art as protest and propaganda and he favors the cultivation of a black art which would reject white aesthetic values first if i may be so bold to speak for jones leroi advocates an art of and for the people ie art for peoples sake he also believes as i do that black art in its purest form will not only educate entertain and elevate but will instill in the people an awareness of self jones believes in bringing black art to the people and in essence bringing them survival survival as a people and as a culture he rejects pure imitation and brings about new standards new values new art ie black aesthetic values mr hayden also states that much of jones poetry is in no legitimate sense racist or propagandist this is to say that some of jones poetry is racist etc etc etc i find that statement racist and thats going some for a negro jones poetry is black which is problack propeople proliving ie protomorrow the editor feels that jones poetry is favored by the nonacademic poets does that mean that he is favored by poets
ud and me are running j £ so fast that the two  i  f birds over neds head kztksis are slowin down in the sky and now they are passing behind the low cloud which must be the one sprinkling these few rain drops on us but we are still running faster than the drops me and cud they know where the devil is at cud is ahead because he aint afraid of the devil but i am and we are running along the fence and cud is leaping over i am sliding on the little slope beside the fence catching myself on the leaning old fence post pulling up and then i am standing high on the fat fence post looking at cud as the big hole in the seat of his overalls shows his black skin and his legs roll away over the field ned is standing near the stump waving at us like he found the greatest secret in the world and  am standing higher on the post puffing stretching out my arms like a bird so that i can see if i can see the devil beating his wife if i can see from here i am staying here i am a waterfall flying off that post and i must be a river because the fence is shaking and trembling and snaking like the dead trees did in the stream when we were fishing a waterfall can put out the devil in a hot hell so i am running faster and then the sun stands on top of me and then hides his head again and you should see my shadow leap away from the side of myself just like when i was swinging from the oak limb on cuds rope yesterday and higher and higher and im gone    look at ned but i am looking only at cud when he slows down whats he slowing for he must see something ned stops waving me on if i really see this devil im gonna be scared of everything for the rest of my life but cud he sees something and he keeps seeing it and now hes waving and it is my turn to see but i am slowing then i am running faster and faster as the sun comes out over the center of the field like a fat pillar of golden air and the  rain is catching up with me and i can see it on the grass and feel it climbing over my muddy bare feet cleaning the stink off    hurry blue you missin it man what they yelling me on for they see im coming and while im coming i strain to see what they see but i dont see nothing but the sun shining down from the sky and the dark field all around shaking in the wind and the rain striking across the light and on the grass i slide and i am there look ned is crazy they dancin cud he crazy too he leans in on the stump squinting at two figures like little carved dolls on top of that old stump its an old stump rotten and a hole is right in the center the rings for age are around that hole which is a rot hole and the rings are like little ditches splinters and twigs stick out of that stump but not like the two figures dancing in the light around the center hole and when i see it i close my mouth shut then my mouth drops open on its own and i feel the rain spirits soaking into me and cud is whispering a little and  am shivering because the sun was hot but now it is raincold and the little dolls on the stump are dancing faster i see the devil dressed in red swinging a whip around his head snorting smoke when a rain drop strikes striking the other on the back the devils wife is dressed in white and the devils wife is falling and she falls    into the hole but she catches the edges of the stump and the devil pulls her up and gets on top of her and i am watching him straddle her and then i hear a scream and the wind is slashing me with rain sun is gone just like that and in the field i am alone cud and ned are racing away yelling and when i look at the stump only the twigs dance in the wind slow back and forth growing bigger and bigger as the sun flicks off and on off and on clouds running and both of them are getting taller and taller giants with hands so big that the fingers are reaching for me now and then i am stumbling over my legs leaping with my heart which i can feel driving a river all over my body and i fly they are way ahead of me and i dont know whats in back of me and dont see anything but the devil chasing me and at home i am puffing out everything watching cuds eyes and neds eyes when we all climb on the back of papas wagon which papa is driving into the yard and i know its my turn  to feed the mule but i still am puffing when papa gets down and thats my papa he knows everything    yall git your chores did fore it start lightnin i am puffing and cud and ned climb down but i cannot stop puffing and papa hears me puffing and i cant talk because the devil is still chasing the road and i point into the sky where the sun is setting and where the rain is still coming and going my papa dont care nothing about it and he is saying boy that aint lightnin and i am still puffing and then i have to get off the wagon and they all looking at me rainin and sunshinin at the same time says ned and he whispers something to cud who dont say nothing except work his mouth and papa says rain under the sun you stick a pin in the ground and put your ear to it and you can hear the devil beating his wife we know it says ned i tell my papa i know it and my head is nodding up and down up and down dizzy and i have to say it i have to say we didnt hear the devil beating his wife this time because we see him do it and my papa is looking at all of us he is going to holler at us but he dont because he sees something    maybe over our heads he sees him coming    and maybe out of my eyes too raining and i have to tell him but i dont right then    how come he beating her i ask my papa is unhitching them mules and we all around him and he tells us the truth and the truth is because it is raining and sunshining at the same time the rain spirits are coming strong now and my papa he says ah you got to do is to stick a pin in the ground or a stump and put your ear to it and you can hear the whole thing now yall git and do them chores but we are standing there dripping which is a lot of rain by now and i feel a river rising up in me and i see cuds eye and cud he looks at ned and ned he looks at me and i am licking my bottom lip with my tongue tasting the sunny salt in the rain and i am going to be the first to tell him  im going to tell my papa we see the devil
during the first half of the s there were no events that mirrored the utter impoverishment of negro creative intellectuals so much as those publicized glamorous meetings that go under the imposing title of negro writers conferences these literary conventionsinblackandtan are without a doubt the nearest thing imaginable to those congressional talkfests in washington d c where every elected representative knows it is his bounden duty to be presentfor the record but only for the record because no one has any intention of passing one bit of positive pending legislation this is another way of saying that negro writers conferences settle nothing solve nothing pose nothing analyze nothing plan nothing create nothingnot even a decent new literary reviewwhich is the least any bunch of serious selfrespecting writers with a gripe ought to do these conferences are comic parodies on the serious substance and reality of negro life which negro literature is alleged to reflect they are engineered by leading writers who when they are not sweating over the manuscripts of secondrate protest novels are chafing at the bit for a dialogue in public with white liberals and the metropolitan press but the inconoclastic nonparticipating observer at these conferences has to wonderwhy these writers who have the unmitigated gall to pursue a dialogue with whites cannot monitor even a positive selfcritical dialogue in  john o killens and the harlem writers guild staged such a conference under the auspices this time of the new school for social research in new york in  there were two writers conferences one in april staged by killens and his literary group and one in february by the american festival of negro arts at fairleigh dickinson university the latter represented a radically dissident outgroup neither of these conferences can be fully understood unless one is explained in terms of the other    and both have to be interpreted in terms of another organizationthe american society of african culture this background also takes in the controversy of several years standing in american negroafrican relations over the philosophical and aesthetic concept of negritude the cultural mystique considered applicable to all peoples of african descent the american festival of negro arts afna conference was the direct result of a split from the american society of african culture amsac this split came about when amsac hedged on carrying out satisfactorily the parent bodys implied cultural program among american negroes relations in amsac had been festering since about  and finally a rival movement of international prestige splintered offf the killens group remained inside amsac and afna came on the scene in conjunction with the emergence of the new young negro creative wave in new york many of these young negroes who attended the afna conference were not invited to the killens conference the uniqueness of afna its readiness to deal with negrowhite cultural fundamentals both ideologically and institutionally was indicated by the fact that the afna affair was not just a negro writers conference it attempted to deal also with painting music the philosophy of negritude literary criticism and enlisted the participation of africans interested in the negro cultural image the conference was administered and projected by the cultural independents and the young generation it was not wellattended yet was a publicrelations and institutional success representing a solid and substantial new direction its discussions and deliberations were orderly mature most of the time intelligent critical and probing and educational it foreshadowed the cultivation of a new literary and cultural critique among the younger negro creative intelligentsia by contrast the much more crowded sessions at the new school in april saw the killens literary and cultural entourage approaching the end of its yearold reign this conference was painfully frenetic and pitifully rhetorical attempting to analyze the negro writers cultural precariousness in american society and the fate of the american negro in american culture as a people here the crisis of the negro intellectual was acted out in vivid detail with truetolife players mouthing lines and speeches they had rehearsed for  years all the ingroup members were there with representatives dating back to the heyday of harlems committee for negro in the arts at the new school was represented the whole left traditionfreedom newspaper harlem writers guild association of artists for freedom inc freedomways magazine american dialog with its echoes of masses and mainstream and for good measure shades of political affairsthe communist partys official theoretical organ the leftwing literary elite was in full control in a desperate bid to reestablish its status within the stream of the new cultural and literary trends the new school conference was staged in memory of the departed lorraine hansberry with the exception of the poetry panel every other panel was policed by one member or two of the harlem cultural ingroup thus the literary cultural and other opinions of killens john henrik clarke sylvester leaks alice childress sara wright william branch ossie davis and ruby dee in absentia and lorraine hansberry through her exhusband robert nemiroff dominated this writers conference james baldwin not originally a charter member of the group was nevertheless the literary lion of the performance but not in the eyes of the ranking members of the exharlem leftwing elite next in order of importance on the panels came certain whites of leftwing literary and critical fame like herbert aptheker and walter lowen fels we shall see in this writers conference how the radical left continues to wield its influence over negro writers the new york times said of the new school conference they hissed and hollered and debated one another for about seven hours yesterday sunday april  and when it was all over  words laterthey could not agree on much of anything but that is the way it was supposed to be free and flailing    in the course of yesterdays program james baldwin was called a literary prostitute the new york times was condemned for covering harlem like a police beat and the national broadcasting company was chided for offering a talented negro playwright a job as a janitor the conference might still be going on now if the moderator allan morrison of ebony magazine had not simply stopped the show but not before he himself had been criticized by the audience both white and negrofor suggesting that perhaps some negroes are not now sufficiently qualified to take advantage of all the opportunities open to them in the creative and communications fields of movies theaters television and journalism  a young woman named myrna baines called mr baldwin an extremely talented literary prostitute the truth is however that the total conference was not all chaos and confusion there were many papers readsome historically informative eloquent and pointedsome anecdotal trite rhetorical and superficial but the discussions around these various papers became emotional and intellectual bedlams several of these papers posed problems and conceptions raised questions and suggested directions which the panelists could neither debate nor pursue to any definitive conclusions the conference led the participants into unknown and unsurveyed regions of black and white cultural reality but once there killens and his faction were able to give not one modicum of intellectual or programmatic leadership the problems of negro writers in terms of craft content and opportunities integrated jobs in the cultural media have been taken up over and over again but these are individual problems when the real substance of what negro writers are dealing with but cant pursue is the group cultural status of the american negro ethnic group the future individual status of the negro writer is predicated on this group cultural status if the two sides of this question are separated the negro writer continues to be what he always wasa craftsman taking his chances as an individual running after whatever support and patronage he can get wherever he can find it even in the communist partyand often selling out what principles he has if any to maintain himself the harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite did precisely this they were all launched as writers by the political leftwing which gave them patronage and support in harlem and beyond through leftwing connections in publishing theater and the broadcasting media some of them actually got more support than their individual talents really merited they were awarded prizes and jobs profitable marriages and social contacts which furthered their careers now they come before the public in writers conferences pretending to be leaders in intellectualcreative thought who are going to advance the negro movementpurely on the strength of the dubious example of their own selfadvancement the emptiness of these pretensions was soon revealed when conference panelists demanded to know where do you go from here what is your plan do you have a new program killens literary faction had no answers when a conferee demanded i want to know how are you going to get this cultural message to enough people to make it effective when most of the people dont read novels what other forms are you planning on using killens answered i would like to redirect the question and ask the whole audience what are you doing because when we write you know it is going to be up to you to help us get to you it is quite a bit to ask the negro writer to write this thing and figure out how it is going to get to you i think this little exchange between negro writer and audience shows clearly why writers conferences are worthless another participant asserted i would like to suggest that the novel is a useless form of art for the urgency of the problem confronting the negro americans specifically and in my own particular case the problems confronting me most important is my urgent desire for freedom first of all end the novel all these people on the panel were talking about the directness that a person should have this young lady novelist said she was not interested in writing a novel about the bourgeoisie in her society she was interested in writing a novel about the poor man unfortunately you are not a poor man but there are some negro writers in america whom this conference has entirely overlooked one of whom spoke in this auditorium at ten oclock this morning saying that i came here to destroy western civilization in effect not to let a ford be a car that i build new parts on to make a jet plane but to offer a jet plane that is different than the thing itself i am talking about poetry and the directness of the people who are in the streets of selma or all over the south and the young people whoi dont know whatbut it is certainly more complicated than sitting for two years at the typewriter and knowing something about a family unit john o killens had no response to this and sylvester leaks the chairman of this panel said all right we accept your statement ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming we must adjourn now roughly thirtyfive negroes in the literary arts the media and the press including the leftwing elite members took part in the conference added to these were several white writers and critics of the negroes interestingly enough there were only seven at the new school conference who had participated in the afna conference in february  they were writer and critic wilmer lucas poets samuel allen calvin hernton and gloria oden and playwrights william branch loften mitchell and ossie davis of these seven only samuel allen had figured personally in the amsacafna split as one of the leading founders of amsac and as the only ranking amsac spokesman who did not boycott the afna conference various other writers who had participated in the afna conference either were not invited or did not appear as panelists at the new school conference what is happening here in all this tentative crossing of lines sorting eliminating and jockeying is that the decline of amsac and the emergence of afna has left killens faction without the influential base it once had within amsac these conferences actually reflect an incipient cultural power struggle within the new york representatives of the negro creative intelligentsia involved in this burgeoning struggle are several factions the literary and cultural left the literary and cultural nationalists the oldguard and the new the unaffiliated negro literary establishment in the universities and certain negro publications behind these lie the crucial issues of africa and the afroamerican image in the arts at the very root of the problem are philosophic and cultural implications of negritude as propounded by the society of african culture in paris and africa interestingly enough while the afna conference had a panel discussion on negritude the new school conference did not at the final session of this latter conference dr john everett president of the new school said of the affair in some ways i have been dismayed by it and in some ways greatly heartened i am dismayed by the fact that the white intellectual community obviously does not know of nor does it have any real comprehension of the vitality and the true strength of the negro intellectual community this has been for me consequently a dismaying experience the dialogue that should be going on between the white intellectual community and the negro intellectual community obviously has not been going on it is one of the functions of the new school to see that this dialogue proceeds and continues the good president had ample reason to be dismayed but he is no doubt a liberal and was being quite kind and maybe even sanguine yet most of what happened at the new school was not a dialogue but a frustrated diatribe a dialogue demands a cultural methodology that these negro writers do not have and that the whites cannot give them a cultural methodology must be predicated on a broad grasp of the totality of cultural factors in life which these writers have never possessed for dr everett to suggest a continued dialogue between negro and white intellectuals means that such a dialogue must proceed on one and the same level with both whites and the negro community however killens group was already blocked from this kind of dialogue by the very presence of the apthekerleft and the ideology it represents the new school conference could not separate literary art as content theme and form from the material basis of cultural expression ie the organizational and administrative nature of the cultural apparatus which has to be treated separately to indulge in analogy these conference writers behave like a bunch of defenders of morality protesting a certain residence being used as a whorehouse instead of a sunday school when the residence is owned operated and built by a professional madam such a situation would suggest a twosided strategyhold the sunday school elsewhere and in the meantime wage a fight by any means possible to oust the madam from ownership of the residence but these conference writers want to hold their sunday school in the madams house while the girls are working on other days besides sunday a whorehouse by any other name is still a whorehouseeven if it is integrated thus these conference writers want to join the prevailing cultural superstructure of america while protesting its standards and values under the misapprehension that the injection of their values whatever they are alleged to be can change that superstructure this is ridiculous no one can hope to change americas cultural standards and values unless the proprietorship the administration and the uses to which the cultural apparatus are put are changed to allow for more democratic social control it is only on this basis that there can be any dialogue between the negro and the white intellectual and it is only along this methodical route that the white intellectual can be prodded and challenged into taking a stand on social change the white intellectual will never take this position on his own because there will always be some establishment posture and privilege he will want to defend be it anglosaxon supremacy the jewish intellectual mystique or the assimilationist worship of the wasp ideal in the cultural arts that there are some blacks participating in this latter category can certainly be deemed a source of ideological confusion for all concerned this very schizoid ambivalence is what befogs the clique consciousness of the writers who staged the new school conference most aptly this conference was dedicated to the memory of the late lorraine hansberry for indeed ideologically she was the groups inspiration and her literary and aesthetic ideals are theirs consequently not a mumbling word that smacks of criticism of hansberrys work will ever come from this group for that would be tantamount to criticizing themselves they could never admit that thev have been accepted by different establishments mostly on the basis of inferior work or that they are talking out of both sides of the mouth projecting the afroamerican image in literature as negro writers today and tomorrow switching images a la hansberrys brustein yet swearing that they are still projecting the black image just as if everybody were truly colorblind sylvester leaks opened his panel discussion with a paper titled the failure of the black writer a most brave and intrepid declaration considering who was listening and watching he then proceeded to criticize not a single negro writer by namepresent or absent the topic of the panel was what negro novelists are saying however the first person to speak on this panel was lorraine hansberrys husband robert nemiroff not previously listed on the panel of six nemiroffs only reference to the subject at handnegro novelistswas that his late wife had started a novel that would not be published this panel opening up the dam of confusion seemed to establish an approach designed to forestall any threat of serious criticism of any literary ingroup member hence with the exception of the blasts at ellison and baldwin nothing emerged but bland critical platitudes and impersonal generalizations at one point killens delivered his prepared assault on ellison herbert hill newly blossoming literary expert on negro affairs acclaimed ralph ellison for all the wrong reasons because ellisons work according to mr hill transcends the traditional occupation of the negro writer    well now mr hill aside from the insufferable paternalistic arrogance of this statement let us take up this question of the mainstream and face the fact that it contains some rather sickly fish from top to bottom killens obviously thinks the literary mainstream rather polluted unless one of course enters either from the left or from the urbanite at the time of freedom newspaper however the word mainstream had not come into vogue rather it was negrowhite unity plus socialist realism john henrik clarke also got in his blows at ellison i particularly wanted to take up with mr hill this continued love affair with ralph ellison who is standing outside of his peoples struggle making olympian remarks about how that struggle should be conducted hill who is the naacps labor secretary replied i would categorically deny that by the way i am sorry that we dont have a chance to discuss mr ellisons work i would simply challenge that point of view clarke i hope mr hill can be brief with this exaggeration of the role of ralph ellison who has spent so much time in the last  years in flight from his own people and has not even answered most mail addressed to him by his fellow black writers and has said positively that art and literature are not racial he wont come into any afroamerican writers conference i think ellison wrote one very interesting thing from the point of view of craftsmanship it was a very good and powerful work whether ralph ellison will follow up whether ralph ellison has grown up is open to question in many quarters starting with me let me say that i do not see how any intelligent person not committed to a previous bias can read invisible man and affirm that mrellison stands aside from the struggle for racial justice in the united states  i am not authorized to speak for mr ellison he speaks very well for himself enter herbert aptheker i just wanted to say that i assume mr clarke has read ralph ellisons book and probably many in the audience have and i have also the invisible man was done about  years ago    clarke nineteen fiftytwo aptheker it is unfortunate that mr ellison is not here  i would say that his work since the invisible man even though he is not here and i prefer not to talk that way in his absence but in terms of what he has published and also his published assertions he has made himself rather not particularly visible in the struggles of the negro people clarke i want to take the qualification further than that i think dr aptheker put it correctly i was referring to the last  years and the last  years when baldwin took flight and went to paris hating himself and his people literally but did come back and enter the mainstream of the struggle whether he is psychologically back home completely opens maybe a question but at least he knows the road that leads to home but mr ralph ellison seems to have been going further away from home in that sense we can see now that the killens group in a precarious situation these days cannot attack ellison on craftsmanship or even content any more as killens did on freedom newspaper because none of them has written anything even remotely comparable to ellisons achievements hence they must assail him on the question of participation in the struggle and the fact that ellison once stated that art and literature are not racial but clarke forgets that lorraine hansberry their great mentor said precisely the same thingraisin was not racial it was not a negro play it was about americans at the  writers conference sponsored by kittens group and amsac lorraine hansberrys paper was not about negro writers problems but about the decadence of such white writers as tennessee williams and others nobody protested that her remarks were not racial nothing was said until after this conference when hansberry scandalized the leading lights of the harlem writers guild by declaring that negro writers are retarded that raised some ire however even if ellison did express the view that literature and art are not racial as clarke insists the evidence remains that all of ellisons work as exemplified in invisible man and shadow and act is definitely racial i would rather believe that ellison expressed this view in  when he refused to attend the amsac conference in order to avoid being involved with kittens whose freedom newspaper review of invisible man ellison had every right to resent on more than political grounds moreover ellison never went as far as miss hansberry did to show all concerned that she truly believed literature and art were not racial the literary leftwing has always functioned on the principle that some negro writers are more privileged than others but there is much more behind this clarkekillens attack on ellison  than comes out kittens has a personal literary stake in all this which clarke does not moreover kittens leftwing background precedes that of clarke by several years the truth is that the racial leftwing will never forgive ellison for writing invisible man no matter what ellison does or does not do about the struggle thus for clarke to chide ellison for refusing to attend any afroamerican writers conference is naive in the extremeespecially conferences run by all the leftwings favored negro writers with political axes to grind in the presence of the leading white communist party theoretician and historian on the negro moreover there would be little value in ellisons attending a killensled conference unless permitted to discuss socialist realism and negro writing on the left but there are no pasternaks among these leftwingsponsored negro writers thus in  both kittens and julian mayfield refused to allow a debate at the amsac conference on the influence of socialist realism on the freedom of negro writers since ellisons writing career on the left precedes that of kittens ellison knows much better than clarke what happens to negro writers on the left who refuse to submit themselves to the standards of socialist realism clarke who is not really a creative writer never had to cope with this question ralph ellison does not owe the left anything since the left did not make him as a writer hence ellison is not morally obligated to support any struggle or any negro writers conferences initiated by the left let the leftwing writers clique in the harlem writers guild get their own house in order and beamed in on reality they have no right to demand that other writers fall in line behind them because the struggle is larger and broader than they are with more ramifications and complexities than their limited imaginations can encompass let them remember that there are still writers functioning today who long ago assumed their writers prerogative to tell the radical left you people do not understand the black peoples dilemma in the united states what has happened to those writers but note how obediently john henrik clarke the africanistafroamerican nationalist mouths every twisted hypocritical ambivalence of the leftwing integrationists in killens group hill was right when he intimated clarke was critically moved by a previous bias in  the same killens crew decided that frank yerby was no longer to be considered a negro writer having joined wright baldwin etc in paris to rewrite new versions of the foxes of harrow that got whiter and whiter would clarke put ellison in yerbys category he would but clarke ought to go back to the may  issue of urbanite and read the last paragraph of lorraine hansberrys article there he will see that in her mind frank yerby was in the same category with charles white leontyne price lena horne harry belafonte james baldwin john killens nina simone paul robeson langston hughes julian mayfield odetta p j sydney eartha kitt and pearl bailey they were in her words a band of angels hurling forth the art of twenty millions well this was miss hansberrys opinion and clarke should take note of the multicolored witches brew of ethnic imagery comprising this list of candidates for high honors in the field of racial identity john henrik clarke is to be respected for one thinghe has never equivocated on his pride in being black and africanesque today however it seems clarke has been placed in a most awkward and degrading ideological position he has to defend and play secondfiddle to certain johnnycomelatelys whose black pride in literature and art is turned at will according to its cultural marketability instead of attacking ralph ellison clarke should have been asking for some clarification from herbert aptheker as to what aptheker meant by this statement thus the components of what veblen saw in the intellectual preeminence of european jews and what ashley montague saw in the natural superiority of women and what karl marx saw as the saving quality of those who labor all are present in the american negro men and women one does not have to move from these opinions to perverse distortions leading off into insidious nationalism but one should see in these opinions additional suggestions towards understanding the centrality of the negro question notice that aptheker did not ascribe natural superiority to the working class but only a saving quality no longer even a revolutionary quality however apthekers paper propounded what he calls the superiority of the american negro in the abstract mass concept aptheker used to view the negro people across historical vistas as a beautiful untarnished and noble folk struggling for equality these were the ingredients of that peculiar genre of leftwing romanticism in negro history writing that historical stream continued unbroken from nat turner and denmark vesey to sojourner truth from john brown and frederick douglass to w e b dubois and herbert aptheker and ultimately to the communist party but this abstract mass concept was applicable only to apthekers brand of writingso easily translated into dogma to most negroes in the flesh he was quite arrogant today this peculiarly inverted racial attitude holds the negro superior a patronization carried to its ultimate dogmatic degree for political purposes for a black muslim to say this doubtless would bring from aptheker the charge of reactionary race chauvinism similar to his own attitudes to the garvey movement the new school conference was valuable in that it demonstrated clearly the limitations of a conference composed only of writers rather than practitioners of all the arts this conference revealed that negro writers are struggling under severe illusions intellectual handicaps and many societal and cultural misapprehensions about reality as david boroff pointed out whether intentionally or inadvertently the negro writer is up against the real ascendancy of the jewish writer and artist in a country of white anglosaxon protestant dominance in every field but the creative and cultural for david boroff to admit that the white anglosaxon creative impulse is just about dead might be news to some of killens group but in truth it has been on the wane ever since its last spurt in the s since that time jewish writers and artists have not only filled that particular creative void they have also preempted a  considerable portion of negro thematic material both in literature and in the field of social science studies during the s when the anglosaxon creative artist was still fecund and original there was much anglosaxonjewish collaboration especially in the theater the late lorraine hansberry condemned the stereotypes of a porgy and bess far more significant is the fact that this great symbol of the negros secondclass status in the cultural arts was a product of jewish and anglosaxon collaboration civilwriters however like lorraine hansberry will be very careful to limit their charges of literary paternalism to writers like the frenchman jean genet far removed from the home ground where native wasps and jews have been battening off the folk for decades both in literature and music as a play the blacks does not touch the heart of the american cultural problem moreover it is in a class by itself as theatrical literature in terms of its newer quality and form it shows up writers of the level of the killens group as rather pedestrian parochial uninspired unimaginative latecomers to the s tradition of protest and pure realism now when baldwin killens hansberry and others have finally caught up with the s the jewish writers are doing something else hence the killens group stands helpless albeit vocal before a situation in american culture whose historical derivatives they do not comprehend yet they themselves unwittingly played certain purblind roles in the recent history of this cultural development no one can much blame negro writers for drifting leftward in culture and politics at some point in their individual careers but once they do too many either become captives for the balance of their intellectual lives or else are ultimately disillusioned if not expelled and drift into a negative kind of isolation or exile few of them ever seem to learn anything positive about reality from this experience the radical left of the s and s was not a movement of anglosaxons or their ideology it was an ethnic movement dominated by negroes and jews and it was the jews who ideologically influenced the negroes thus the radical left in america has developed in such a way that the jewish ethnic group one of the smallest in the country had more political prestige wielded more theoretical and organizational power than the negro who in fact represented the largest ethnic minority consequently all political and cultural standards on the radical left were in the main established and enforced by jews for and on negroes this negrojewish state of affairs was paralleled outside the radical left as well in the civil_rights organizations one can explain this development rationalize it excuse it condemn it or uphold it call it negative or positive but the fact remains that it was ethnically undemocratic more important it has retarded and smothered the negros intellectual and political development on the cultural front it has prevented negro writers and artists from grappling in a creative fashion with the underdeveloped cultural status of the negro within a multicultural and multiethnic society the negro has been boxed in politically economically and culturally he has been unable to improvise on another groups standards and rules of playing the game on the other hand many negroes have developed their own brand of laissezfaire acquiescence to the status quo these writers did not realize they were limiting the range and the scope of their own talents so bent were they on making it nor did they see through the cultural ruse being perpetrated on them and the cultural paternalism and control exercised behind that ruse herbert apthekers tumultuous praise for william branchs play in splendid error in masses and mainstream  went unchallenged no one would admit that it was actually a bad play that happened to be about john brown and frederick douglass thus praiseworthy as an historical civil_rightsprotest play leftwing jewish writers however were not writing this kind of a play one of the big theatrical hits of the time was the world of sholem aleichem a dramatization of the jewish folk writers stories and certainly no protest play the killens group were very impressed with this example of creative jewish theater artmainly because ruby dee was given a white role to play as an integrated casting giftthis was the great achievement john o killens summing up of the new school conference was an exercise in literary and cultural doubletalk he took no stand on a single question of literary principle simply paying lip service to all points of view on that intangible called universality while killens did not openly say he favored the blackoutsidewhiteinside literary school or the i am just a writer who happens to be a negro stance of james baldwin and others he did make the following revealing comments but most of the writers that were here this weekend seemed to be askingdoes art have any nobler purposehas art ever had any nobler purpose the question kept being raised on the platform and from the audience and it reminded me of sidney brustein and the sign in sidney brusteins window the question how the how is important i should say the how is damned important how do we reach the ears of the negro people of our country   note the flicker of the twinimage the negrojewish identityexchange motif of the hansberry dramatic saga referred to by one who has always maintained that he was never in doubt as to who he is and what he is as a writer i am a negro writer said killens and my materials are basically the negro people but after all is said and done killens must still peer from the outside into sidney brusteins window to find out how to reach the ears of the negro people the new school writers conference demonstrated without a doubt that the former harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite are possessed of an intellectual literary and creative ethnic duality they refuse to admit taken as a whole they are neither white black nor jewish but an amalgam of all three unless the negro creative intellectuals as a stratum can evolve creative and artistic policies that will govern cultural programs organizations and selfsustained and administered research institutions they cannot achieve cultural democracy against the competitions of white andor jewish intelligentsia america today is a cultural desert strewn with the corpses of commercialized commodityart where sweet voices sing lullabies of cultural degeneration its aesthetics are antilife its images those of lunacy and the propaganda of destruction in america the political power and economic status of the white anglosaxon are considered ample compensation for the nations lack of cultural prestige imposed on it by wasp rule in this void the jew has played a manysided role as the ethnic middleman of culture whereas the negro has been a mere commodity on the cultural market to be bought out sold short sold out or else frozen out this situation cannot long endure if this nation is to haul itself out of its own internal mire and rehabilitate its image in the eyes of the world the negro creative intellectual has a potentially powerful role to play in this process if he can master a literary and cultural critique reorientation which it is doubtful the oldguard negro writers of the new school writers conference can achieve new younger more willing and imaginative creative forces are needed back in  wallace thurman wrote a novel in which he satirized the negro artists and writers of the s negro renaissance one of the characters complained that the average negro intellectual and artist  has no goal no standards no elasticity no pregnant germ plasm after praising only one negro artist of that time who had the elements of greatness the character observed again the rest of us are mere journeymen planting seed for someone else to harvest we all get sidetracked sooner or later the older ones become warped by propaganda  we younger ones are mired in decadence none of us seem to be able to rise above our environment wallace thurman called his novel infants of the spring yet in over  years the negro writers of the new school conference the former harlem leftwing literary and cultural elite have not really advanced much further than the negro renaissance writers in terms of ideas if the s negro writers were infants of the spring the present  elite are adolescents of the long hot summer they are intellectuals in a crisis but a crisis occasioned not merely by an inherited backlog of unresolved history but by the fact that they are not truly intellectuals by any historical and cultural definition
this is one mans reaction to a damn good book harlem is a very expensive piece of real estate bounded on the east by the east river and on the west by the hudson river and on the north by white folks and on the south by white folks it is many things to many people it is the neighborhood el barrio to some it is the jungle to so many others it is moreover a colony on the mainland of the mother country and the country is a mother right the last of the great white mothers stepmother dig it down these mean streets alfred knopf  is a book about the neighborhood an autobiography a couple of years back my son wrote to me dad as  walk through the negro neighborhood i suddenly realize that the negro ghetto is not a ghetto it is home it was a revelation that shook me to my hominy grits langston hughes of course knew it all along he never bought the jungle bit to the great man it was home sweet home bitter home loften mitchell always knew it but white men designated it as the jungle and the jungle it was to many black folks conservatives and radicals and all the variations in between moderates liberals militants many of whom lived in the neighborhood all of their lives unharmed physically but were scared to be out after dark because the man had called their home the jungle dig called it the jungle thereby creating the image of a place where only beasts and savages abided save for a few courageous white men missionaries mercenaries and such who ventured into the jungle at their own peril to christianize the savages and bring them progress and glad tidings of the wondrous blessings of civilization according to the script the priest the explorer the merchant were the good guys always and forever repeat if the man says it is the jungle then of course it must be the jungle existing only to be exploited for its raw materials its people but comes the native insurrection when the costs of exploitation become prohibitive then the jungle must be destroyed along with the beasts and savages who dwell therein and most of the great stories depicting the jungle written sometimes even by black would you believe colored writers have been in essence all about how i lived through my jungle days and made my escape to civilization and transcended my cultural deprivation and wrote a best seller about it meaning if i did why not you why not every man down these mean streets is an autobiography written by piri thomas a black puerto rican who looked upon east harlem not as jungle but as el barrio the neighborhood his neighborhood home not a ghetto but home he was not always a black puerto rican that is what the core of his story is about one mans lonely journey to his blackness it is moreover because he possessed the artistry to make it so the universal story of the manofcolors journey to his selfhood his identity piri thomass parents were of course from puerto rico his mother was visibly white but was blacker in her psyche than his father who was black visibly but who was for the most part in full flight from his blackness piri was the oldest child in a family of seven children the oldest and the blackest and thereby hangs a significant aspect of his journey to identity through most of his young life he loved his father even though he felt a sharp rejection from him much of which he attributed to his and his fathershigh degree of visibility poverty alienation disenchant ment gang rumbles love discrimination sex dope addiction robberiespiri thomas journeyed down many and varied mean streets in a searchofdesperation for his manhood selfhood most of these mean streets turned out to be escape hatches ephemeral as a tornado and equally as devastating elusive as a willowisp some were deadends pure and simple there was a stint in the merchant marines an abortive stickup in a downtown manhattan nightclub a sixyears stretch in prison all the beautiful ugliness of life is within these pages down these mean streets piri was a man in motion in a perpetual state of war against the formidable windmills of establishment and these mean streets do not stop at central park they go with piri and his black and afroamerican brother all the way to galveston texas where he does a thing in a white hotel with a white whore who thinks she is making it with a spanish cat    then i stepped in front of the mirror and put my jacket on the broad was still on the bed wondering if i was going to make her again when  walked to the door she smiled and said in broken texas spanish did i like it and did i want more i opened the door and said baby i just want you to knowand i watched her smile fall off and a look of horror fill the empty space it lefti just want you to know i repeated   that you just got laid by a nigger by a black man and i didnt wait to hear her gasp or to watch her jump out of the bed i ran i disappeared because i learned a long time ago to hit and run right back to the turf and my turf was that goddamn ship the characters in this book are many and varied fleshandblood and nittygritty people the language is real and fresh and true for the most part it is a gutsy idiomatic blending of puerto rican and afroamericanese dig it mean streets has a terrible beauty a work of art it is a fine job of writing feeling living moreover it is a book that breaks with the tradition of most books written about harlem about all the harlems of the usa harlem is not the ghetto in this book for ghetto is yet another european word formulated out of contempt for the inhabitants of the ghetto in the american context it is another word for jungle in the good old usa it means that any neighborhood inhabited solely by black men is ipso facto an inferior place too many black folk have bought this view this definition of every black community this image of the black mans capacity for nationhood for neighborhood if you will for black community hood having accepted this negative view of blackness and black potential this for many middle class black folks has meant a lifetime of running away from self and selfhood it is time far past time brothers and sisters to stop running and come on home come on home and affirm your dignity and your manhood here they are no place else but here with us security for black folks even middle class black folks is rooted in el barrio in unity with the black masses supreme court appointments appointed mayors of washington etc notwithstanding your true strength must come from us from blackness all else are mere tokens of ol massas affection and whatever of massa giveth he can damn sure take away bless him so come on back home to the turf the neighborhood and help to make it all of these mean streets a fitter place for human habitation this was brother malcolms vision this is the last clear chance for your salvation come on home brothers and sisters and let us together take charge of our community and rid it of the lecherous gringos and we will create our own definitions of ourselves and our communities we will designate them all anew is wherever black men live the ghetto or is it the neighborhood the turf home what is the word in afroamericanese for el barrio come let us reconstruct the neighborhood in our own black image 
weve often wondered in the dim caves of our jealous heart just how fair it is to ask a trying to be writer to give an appraisal of a first published effort by a real writer would the fangs of hurt sink so deeply that a wounded animal would shriek its pain across the page called looked for spelling errorsfaults in book review its very important to consider the source before accepting the word and we would like to assure the reader that if we could have found fault with the flagellants farrar straus  giroux  we would have we read it twicewe sentence structureanything we were so upset by not finding anything that we read it again for its hate content it is small and the print is such that our weak eyes sent a sighful prayer to the black madonna for realizing that colored people like big print and warming the white mans heart to make him give it to us there are two minor white women in the story of ideal and jimson and we looked and looked to see if miss polite had been unduly prejudiced again we must report that she was fair much nicer than perhaps we would have been had they messed with us like they messed with ideal then we went to jimsonand we believed every black woman has had her jimsonto see if he was treated with the proper respect due a black uncastrated man jimson was not as fully developed as he could have been but he was as fully developed as he should have been for miss polite takes both the black man and the black woman to their naked selves beyond even the black skin all the way down she takes us into the black bones with all unnecessary organs removed down into back bones with only black hearts raw nerve endings a black thimble inside the skull holding the required responses and the black organ that is a delicacy in southern states presented only after an involved ceremony to the purest and truest of southern ladies she puts these to us in her novel and it hurts not because she creates sympathy it is too late for either to deal with sympathy not because she creates guilt guilt has no meaning for black people but because it is so near a truth we hope it is not the truth for if the black man and the black woman must leave each other to be happy and fulfilled people then we are damning untold generations to hopelessness and we would not deny a truth because it hurts but we cannot accept the separation of the only true human beings as the answer to their and our salvation nor would we force a unity of black delicacy with black hallow just for the sake of unity anything for anythings sake is nothingness and in the process of natural selection a panther may play in a field of sheep he may run and jump and do many delightful things but when the dinner bell sounds and the hunt begins he will join the other panthers in making a meal of the ewe and the ram who objects will be put in his place miss polites novel is excellent reading her style is very definitely her own and the style is a part of the story telling there are dreams and images and feelings that all merge and flow with back flashes to her past and forebodings about the future it becomes clear to ideal that she is being abused not because jimson doesnt work isnt a poet or a man but because he no longer loves her and will not allow her to go at a point of happiness he cuts the fruit from the vine at its overripe state and forces ideal to drool for the sweet juices that once were hers while watching the maggots fornicate on it and multiply neither ideal nor jimson is strong nor are they weak they are simply one black man and one black woman trying to find the sweet black life it was denied ideal and jimson it need not be denied us all the flaggelants describes beautifully a relationship in a given period it may well become one of the major novels of the sixties it is an enlightenment and we heartily recommend it we would like to remind our readers that we give this praise under the strong protest that we didnt write itnikki giovanni
