the strident voices of black selfassertion and the bittersweet  f ¦ £ gropings towards afroamerican identity which now fill the  i £ dark ghettos of the nation seem to provide a strange and a most embarrassing backdrop to the largely unnoticed approach of another negro history week indeed the juxtaposition of such a typically american institution against the broad panorama of our newest coming of blackness is likely a testimony to a frame of mind which must not go unchallenged at so pregnant a moment in the nations life evidently there are many wellmeaning persons who think of negro history in the context of the overall american story in much the same way that they think of individual negroes and their integration into the american society that is they are adamantly and often vociferously in favor of small but prominent doses of negro history being dropped into the national saga but they insist that these black drops should never be numerous or indelible for if they are too many and too black they might necessitate unpleasant rereadings reassessments and rewritings of the entire story and such adjustments would never be tolerated by the american society to say nothing of the historical professionor so the unspoken lines seem to go it is my thesis and partly the motivation for my work that an american history which cannot contain the full story of the black pilgrimage is no more worthy of life than an american society that cannot bear the full and troublesome black presence in its midst indeed it is my intention to suggest that just as america can know no survival worth considering unless it finds a way of facing its black counterimage so too our history is a tale told by fools if it does not incorporate the afroamerican experience with unflinching integrity and if such open encounter between black and white american history should produce the same sense of insecure teetering on the edge of the unknown as we now experience in the human encounter so much the better nor does the analogy end there the urgency some of us feel for the creation of such a new american history is no less critical than the pressure that impels us to seek for the lineaments of a new american society obviously the tasks are not unrelated for there will be no new beginnings for a nation that refuses to acknowledge its real past therefore the uses of the afroamerican past are many varied and crucial at this difficult but inevitable juncture in american life they will be examined here in stages ranging from the obvious to the enigmatic at that end of the continuum most flooded with the light of reason it should be clear that any american history that ignores the central role of black people as actors and foils on this maddening stage is a falsified and misleading history it is for instance a history that ignores the ironic symbol of that summer in jamestown more than three centuries ago when representative government and african bondsmen had a mutual beginning of sorts in the citadel of colonial democracy a beginning that seemed to lock the rhetoric of democracy and the reality of black inequality into the american heart it is a history that tries to explore the making of the constitution without understanding the major price in its integrity that was exacted by the system of slavery and its proponents both north and south it is a history that attempts to speak of the peculiar institution as if there were no human beings involved who produced no authentic historical materials thus a major publisher could attempt last year to produce a collection of documents on slavery without one document from a slave it is a history that speaks of jacksonian democracy as if the expanded white franchise were not purchased at the cost of the black northern vote in many states such a vacuous history treats reconstruction as if it were another unfortunate mistake rather than one of the nations greatest lost chances to be honest and free it is a history that deals with the turn of the nineteenth century without suggesting the way in which the rising tide of brutality against blacks and indians at home may have permanently poisoned the nations attempts at expansion among nonwhite peoples elsewhere it is a history that tries to understand the urban crisis of the s without tracing the long and bloody lines of negro migration since reconstruction it is a history that attempts to interpret current american culture without any appreciation for the major role black people have played in creating the popular culture of the nation especially since the s it may well be that a history without the afroamerican story cannot offer sufficient insights into the reasons why the nation can now be so numb to the brutalization of a vietnam thousands of miles away perhaps it cannot understand this because it denies the physical and spiritual destruction of black persons which has become a part of the american way of life and has likely created a callous on whatever heart a nation has it is such a history that has contributed immensely to the miseducation of the american people and has brought them so unprepared to face a world that is neither white christian capitalist nor affluent such history may yet prove poisonous and if there is any possible antidote on the american scene it could be the hard and bitter medicine of the afroamerican past is it too late for a society that still insists that its drops be few and painless this question will be examined more fully below now it is important to recognize another obvious use of the afroamerican past even when one acknowledges how grotesquely slow is the pace at which black people are moving on to the american stage the knowledge of their history is still absolutely indispensable as they proceed it is essential on the one hand to the oldnew comers as they cast off the roles of the past and seek for new ones if they come to the integrated scene with integrity they must come with a knowledge of themselves and of the manysplendored gifts they bring black students in formerly white schools  must not enter as suppliants who are going to be transformed from disadvantaged to advantaged buy such a move they must be so aware of their black fathers and the wealth of their soiritual and intellectual heritage that they will sharply illuminate the disadvantages inherent in an isolated beleaguered middleclass white world if they are to become more than black anglosaxons and god knows we have enough white ones without adding carbon copies then they cannot accept the old doctrines of slavery which encouraged them to believe that god somehow blessed darkest africa with the light of christian guns and shins and chains neither the ancient kingdom of songhai nor the modern kingdom of harlem was benighted without whites and black young people need to know the measurements of the lightin both places any society that would encourage black children to live in a state of permanent amnesia or shameor bothconcerning their fathers and their fathers ways of life is a society not worth knowing any men who would enter such a society on its amnesiac terms would only add to its corruption whether they entered through the door of the ninth grade or by the carpeted way of a general electric executive suite but it must also be acknowledged that such knowledge is exceedingly dangerous for if it were faithfully presented a reading of the afroamerican past might cause black exiles to refuse many an open door indeed some doors might be torn from their hinges nor would this be teaching hatred of whites rather it would be the necessary and healthy explanation for the existence of the hatred and fear that most black men have known from childhood on any society lacking the courage to take such risks with light lacks the courage to live on the other obvious hand those white persons who first encounter the token blacks in their new roles are also in desperate need of the afroamerican past for without it they will be tempted to feel that they are doing a favor for the students or the junior executives by letting them in properly read the pages of the negro past will reveal that it is black people who have done the favor by doing so much to build the nation under such horrible circumstances and by letting such ambiguous doors stay on their hinges for so long a time compassionately understood the black past will teach all benefactors that they are receiving a favor in being allowed what may be the one last chance to do justice that they are being graced by the presence of a people whose pilgrimage is perhaps the only true epic poem that america has ever known such a reading of the afroamerican past might even shatter the general illusion that token acceptance of token negroes will ever bring any basic hope for the survival of any of us perhaps the issue of survival suggests another level of our need for he story of this dark journey in america not long ago the most highly esteemed newspaper in america asked an author to write his reflections on the reasons for the current breaking of america into two parts based on race when it rips apart all the easy generalizations of our textbooks written largely by for and about white america the new coming of black history would cast such a question into limbo for any perceptive apprehension of the negrowhite encounter cannot fail to reveal that there have always been two major communities in this nationbased on race the breaking began in west africa and continued in every colony and state that came into being if we read with both speed and comprehension it may not be too late to ask the right questions questions based not on newark or detroit in  but on jamestown and philadelphia and springfield and st louis over the centuries for it is only as america faces a denmark vesey a nat turner a w e b du bois a paul robeson and a malcolm_x that the nation will begin to be ready to understand a stokely carmichael a rap brown and the host of black radicals yet to come such a reading would identify each one as made in america product of its broken community how shall this land create new and whole men if it refuses to examine its past production record a record strewn with the crushed bodies and spirits of black radicals hurling defiant curses and urgent pleas for renewal from the same dying lips at the identical insistent moment it is these angry young men whose lives demonstrate the fact that the afroamerican past and the black present are no longer matters of limited national concernif they ever were indeed they suggest to us what may be one of the most profound and universally significant uses of this history that is its service as an entrance to the nonwhite nonwestern world let me elaborate on what i mean one of the most gifted and least celebrated american political analysts used to say that the basic division in the world now and for some time to come was not based on communism versus capitalism rather a j muste said the world was divided now between those peoples who had rarely if ever known defeat and humiliation as a national experience and those who had lived with this for centuries in a sense muste was simply echoing the profound insights expressed by w e b du bois half a century earlier however formulated the concepts of these men remind us that the world experience of the last  years has meant that the vast majority of the earths humiliated people have been nonwhite and their humiliation has come at the hands of the white western world moreover it appears that this nation now stands as the selfproclaimed leader of that unhumiliated world and finds itself at once the most powerful and one of the least comprehending national states it is obvious that one of americas most critical blind areas is in the realm of understanding the oppressed the wretched of the earth our vaunted experience of virtually unbroken success our alabaster cities undimmed by human tears except for the unseen tears of the poor and the black and our movement into the strange joys of advanced corporate capitalismall these have cut this people off from the rest of the world in significant ways if there is any real concern among the american people to understand why men are determined to fight bombers with rifles and curses why revolutions seem to grow up wherever americas footprints mark the earth then the afroamerican story is essential reading for here in the heart of america is the nations major link to the alienated humiliated and rebellious nonwhite world its story is at once tied to the nonwest and a part of the american past indeed richard wright says the history of black folk is the history of america written in    bloody terms    a failure to explore this vital link on its own terms through its own history might well prove disastrous not only within the nation but at every troubled spot where this nation reaches out its ambiguous hands beyond the west without such an exploration we might continue to be puzzled at the worlds disbelief concerning our sudden devotion to the rights of selfdetermination for the nonwhite masses of vietnam a nation that combines the american predilection towards violence the american stockpile of weapons and the american lack of empathy for the earths humiliated peoples is a dangerous nation perhaps it can begin another life by introducing itself to the invisible men in its midst by seeking to know the quality of suffering and hurt and the rebellion they spawn such an introduction must includeif not begin withthe past nor are black americans excused from such a task for we are constantly exposed to a terrible temptation to forget the black and bloody ground out of which we sprang as the price for american acceptance as du bois put it more than a decade ago    most american negroes even those of intelligence and courage do not fully realize that they are being bribed to trade equal status in the united states for the
slavery of the majority of men so the afroamerican past must remind black people that we are children of the humiliated and the oppressed that our fathers were colonized and exploited subjects and that the ghettos we have recently left are still too often filled with the stench of poverty and despair such history must remind afroamericans that all of our greatest leaders have begged us to stand in solidarity with the black and anguished people of the earth we are their spokesmen in the midst of the worlds foremost antirevolutionary power if we forsake them we forsake our past our fathers and our own best selves if we forsake them there may be no future for our children or theirs if we forget our own fathers burnings in village squares and on american uniforms to set fires against the worlds desperate revolutions we will deserve nothing but the scorn of men and the judgement of the gods reference to the nations lack of empathy with the desperate men of the earth suggests yet another closely related use of the afroamerican past some years ago d w brogan that english expert on american affairs referred to what he called the myth of american omnipotence his use of this phrase referred of course to his conviction that the reading of the american past was distorted by a conception of this nation as an entity incapable of failure powerful and pure enough to succeed at anything it chose the corollary of this myth said brogan in  the days of mccarthys reign was that any american failure at home or overseas had to be explained by subversion or conspiracies orat worsta mistake in wellintentioned american judgement now related to brogans myth is what might be called the myth of american romanticism ever since the nations beginning it has been plagued by this equally crippling misconception of itself succinctly put this misconception involves a belief that american history is the story of a society moving on a straight upward line from perfection to perfection from goodness to betterness from being better than other nations to being the best and most complete nation that god had ever stood over i take it that is the implication of being under god this mythology was intensified to the point of indoctrination after world  war ii when history became a tool of the cold war and it became necessary to prove consistently the superiority of america over every conceivable communist socialist or neutralist model in the world this is a selfimage on the level with fairy tales and happiness forever after it is the selfunderstanding of those whose adult development has been aborted by the fear of the risks of growth most importantly it is a refusal to recognize the bloody tragic line that whips its way through all of life failure to face the tragic is failure to mature in national as well as personal spheres so in the midst of this pabulum view of history a serious implanting of the afroamerican past could be the difference between death and growthat least spiritually for if there is any story that would fling america up against the tragic elements of her history it is the story of that oldnew people created here by force annealed by the heat of suffering into afroamericans were american historians and american citizens at large to face this story manyif not allof their liberal superficial myths about and hopes foramerican society might be transformed they would need to face again the fact that two of their greatest heroes jefferson and lincoln were convinced that black and white people could never live on a basis of true equality in america they would be pressed to realize that the great emancipator cared far more deeply for a cheaply won white reconciliation than for the very costly black liberation thereby helping to lead the nation down bloody paths of malice for all the close reading of the black past might reveal how fully this broken people has tested every line of american democratic rhetoric and how fully each word has shrunken before the ultimate test in every generation they would also see the pathetic and perennial sight of esteemed national leaders offering solutions a generation old to wounds long past such ancient salves a reading of the black preachers poets and editors a sensitive listening to the singers of our songs would face the nation with the ceaseless rage that has been the lot of men in every strange land who have been called upon to sing to dance to laugh and to be grateful and in those pages any searching eye would easily spy the centuryold predictions of black alienation sedition rebellion and guerrilla warfare disaster has always lurked at the american door tragic disaster created largely by blindness to the nations fatal flaw not only would the tragic nature of american life perhaps become more clear but the afroamerican story would remind the nation that it was conceived as an experiment an experiment that could yet fail miserably utterly explosively almost a century ago henry adams described the america of  as very healthy except for the cancer of slavery the irony and the tragedy of a very healthy cancerous body is still the american condition and though no cure has yet been found for the cancer it may not be too late to open the blind eyes to see its sources in the past and what if we open our eyes only to discover that jefferson and lincoln and many black men were right that present white prejudice and black bitterness and unbroken lines of injustice from the past now make it impossible for us to continue together in integrity is it better to go on in blind selfrighteous rage towards internecine struggle or to see finally see with sad and mature clarity the pathway down from all our past romantic dreamsincluding the dream of integration the black experience in america allows for no illusions not even that last ancient hope of the chosen american people whom god will somehow rescue by a special act of his grace america began with such hopes but they were tied to the idea of a covenant that men would have to do gods will for them to remain as his chosen ones somehow just as america forced black men to do so much of its other dirty but productive work the nation evidently came to believe that whites could be chosen while blacks did that suffering which has always been identified with the chosen ones now that is over the black past has begun to explode and to reveal to a hiding chosen people that to be the annointed one is to be crushed and humiliated by the forces of the world after almost  years how significant a period of exile the black branch of the chosen people has grown louder than ever before in its refusal to take the sufferings apart from the privileges of the chosen status so it may be that for all who see it the afroamerican past illuminates the meaning of being chosen perhaps this is what white americans must see that they will either join the ranks of suffering and humiliation beginning perhaps with losing face in vietnam or there will be no chosen people on these shores either they will submit their children to some of the same educational terrors they have allowed black children to endure or there is no future for any either they will give up their affluence to provide necessities for others or there will be neither affluence nor necessities for anyone perhaps we were chosen together and we cannot move towards a new beginning until we have faced all the horror and agony of the past with absolute honesty perhaps integration is indeed irrelevant until the assessment of a long unpaid debt has been made and significant payments begun perhaps atonement not integration is the issue at hand of course one last shattering possibility may remain it could be that the message of the afroamerican past is this only one branch of the chosen people has really paid the dues of sufferingwith the scars to show for it therefore it may be that only the black branch will be  allowed to shape the future of the nation and to determine its calling for the world perhaps only black people are open enough and sensitive enough and scarred enough as a group to lead this nation into true community with the nonwhite humiliated world perhaps that world of sufferers will trust no american leaders save those who bear the marks of oppression in their souls perhaps it will listen only to those who know the tragic sense of life and are not blind and calloused bearers of death perhaps it is already time for the last to be first in our nation how shall that overturning come that knowledge may be too great for even the afroamericans past to bear perhaps our black history can only bear witness to the truth and living men must shape that truth into new action and new history to those who would close their ears to such interpretations of the black past to those who would tune out because such strange musings seem unrelated to the historians vocation i would leave you only with the word of a white radical who read black history with some care before an audience of wellmeaning whites in a time of similar crisis he spoke on the afroamerican past focussing on the greatness of a black leader named toussaint holding louverture above the great white heroes of the age then wendell phillips set out these words you think me a fanatic tonight for you read history not with your eyes but with your prejudices so spoke a man who believed that there was no healing for america either in small black drops of history or in small black drops of negro freedom had the nation heard his word and followed his uses of the past we might well have been spared most of the bloody days between and the terrorfilled nights yet to come will there be time before the last night we who are black we who have lived in night and waited long in darkness may have a special word of light for a stumbling powerbound people we do not panic easily shall the word be heard only those with ears can say it is our calling our vocation to speak it and if the last darkness should fall it is preferable that we be found standing faithful to all the agonizing sorrowjoy of our afroamerican past than lost and sullen black defenders of a world that sucked out our memory and bleached our minds such a land deserves no defense better that it pass and make way for whatever is yet to comeeven if it be the longdelayed last silence or will it be the drums of morning i do not know the afroamerican past leaves a man with no illusions but even in the heart of chaos it does not strip him of his hope we have come too far through too much chaos to cop out here
until about  years ago negro historians were almost j it t z totally ignored by white historians and their various historj i i f ical associations although many negro historians had been v jfj trained at the best american universities they were not con sidered objective enough to write negro history and it went without saying that negro historians could not write about whites there was an upper class snoobishness in the white historians holding history as the grandest and most exclusive of the scholarly disciplines and so although negro historians have a long and outstanding history and are responsible for nearly all truthful negro history the writing  about them by negroes and whites has been fragmentary there are the scattered notes on negro historians in vernon loggins the negro author his development in america up to   and in john hope franklins from slavery to freedom   joseph grimes page unpublished masters thesis a study of the negro historian  university of iowa  a brief introductory section on the negro historian in the negro caravan  two articles by helen boardman and carter g woodson on the rise of the negro historian and negro historians of our time respectively negro history bulletin april  a section of herbert apthekers article negro history arsenal for liberation new masses feb   on negro historians e e thorpes article on negro writers of negro church history southern university bulletin fall  and occasional articles on individual negro historians such as george washington williams william wells brown and carter g woodson in the journal of negro history and other periodicals and that was all of the bibliography until the negro scholar e e thorpes small book negro historians in the united states was published in  since then we have had sections of thorpes the mind of the negro   and august meiers negro thought in america   devoted to negro historians the first negro history was written by negro and white defenders of the race early in the nineteenth century as mostly biographical sketches of distinguished negroes this work was the american counterpart of abbe gregoires de la litterature des negres  translated in  the first two works by negroes that could be called history were paul cuffes brief account of the settlement and present situation of the colony of sierra leone in africa published in  and prince saunders haytian papers a collection of very interesting proclamations and other official documents together with some account of the rise progress and present state of the kingdom of haiti published in  in london and  in america later came robert b lewis light and truth in  republished in  in an enlarged edition the first extensive effort of an american negro to dig into the story of his past in  j w c pennington published a history for school children arranged in questionanswer form titled a text book of the origin and history of the colored people also in  james mccune smith gave a lecture of the hayden revolution with a sketch of toussaint louverture pennington published his slave narrative the fugitive blacksmith in  as did many other negro exslaves who wrote or dictated narratives both before and after penningtons the most important of these is the narrative of frederick douglass which went through three different editions over the years the first negro to do the research and interpretation of a historian was william c nell whose pamphlet services of colored americans in the wars of  and  was published in  and a larger revised book edition of this later in  titled the colored patriots of the american revolution with sketches of several distinguished colored persons to which is added a brief survey of the condition and prospects of colored americans here the main themes that were to be the chief concerns of the negro historian for a long time were set forth  the negros military service  biographical sketches of the few distinguished negroes and  the united states race problem an early work dealing with the last of these three themes is the condition elevation emigration and destiny of the colored people of the united states politically considered  by martin r delany a negro physician and cofounder and assistant editor of frederick douglass newspaper north star delany also wrote blake or the huts of america  the third novel by an american negro the second novel was frank w webbs the garies and their friends  there were early negro church historians christopher rush an early church worker and a founder of the phoenix society in  wrote with george collins the history of the ame church in  republished in  william t catto in  wrote the history of the first african presbyterian church in philadelphia and william douglass recorded in  the annals of the first african church in the usa other negro church historians will be taken up later william wells brown abolitionist lecturer and writer and author of clotel or the presidents daughter the first novel by an american negro in  turned early to the writing of history he published his historical lecture st domingo its revolutions and its patriots emphasizing toussaint louverture in  and the black man his antecedents his genius and achievements more biographical than historical in  these were followed by the negro in the american rebellion his heroism and his fidelity  the first book of the records of negro troops contrabands and slaves during the civil war and later in  the rising son or the antecedents and advancement of the colored race a large work that included much that had gone into the earlier books william still an antislavery negro worker in philadelphia kept in a secret place voluminous records of the fugitive slaves and their rescuers from  to  in  he compiled his thick volume the underground railroad a record of facts authentic narratives letters etc republished in  joseph t wilson the negro historian of the grand army of the republic wrote several histories just after this j including emancipation its course and progress from  bc to ad   and the black phalanx  a history of the negro in the civil war but pennington nell brown and still were more abolitionists than historians edward w blyden was academically equipped to write history but he wrote mostly about the problems of the colony of liberia west africa and africa in general the first negro historian whose scholarship made him worthy of serious attention was george washington williams a pennsylvanian and a civil war soldier who had been educated in massachusetts aware of the importance of structure as well as the researching of facts williams made his twovolumed history of the negro race in america from  to   a landmark in historical writing which is still useful today he followed this up with a history of the negro troops in the war of the rebellion   a book that was still considered until recently by many as the best book on the negro in the civil war williams won recognition from the white literary world he was called the negro bancroft there were other biographical historical works by negroes during this period such as william j simmons men of mark  a dictionary of negro biography john wallaces carpetbag rule in florida  reprinted in  about reconstruction in florida and e a johnsons a school history of the negro race in america  there were later negro church histories such as daniel a paynes history of the a me church  j w hoods history of the amez church  bishop charles henry phillips history of the colored methodist episcopal church in america  and other church works by b t tanner and lewis j jordan there were also several good biographies of john brown at this time by the white writers f b sanborn r j hinton james redpath w e connelley and others but the first scientific study of negro history was w e b du bois doctoral dissertation in history at harvard university the suppression of the african slavetrade to the united states of america  published in  as volume one in the harvard historical studies series authoritative and scholarly and written by one of the giants of negro history this work was reprinted in  by the social science press and in  by russell and russell both in new york city the period from the late s through the s was one in which great efforts were made by negroes to write about their own history and culture and to counter the terrible racist propaganda spewed by u s books newspapers and magazines at that time the american negro historical society of philadelphia was organized in  to collect relics and facts of negro progress and development the more influential negro society for historical research was started by j e bruce and a a schomburg in  and the association for the study of negro life and history was organized by carter g woodson in  some of the earlier books of negro history by negroes during this period after the du bois work of  are w h councills lamp of wisdom or race history illuminated  rev c t walkers appeal to caesar  rev harvey johnsons the nations from a new point of view  and pauline hopkins primer of facts pertaining to the early greatness of the african race  later and more scholarly books of negro history by negro writers were william a sinclairs the aftermath of slavery  booker t washingtons story of the negro the rise of the race from slavery  reprinted in  and w e b du bois biography of john brown  reprinted in  which commemorated along with the white writer oswald garrison villards john brown  reprinted twice the fiftieth anniversary of browns death in  also the white writer wilbur sieberts the underground railroad  benjamin g brawleys a short history of the american negro  fourth revised edition in  william h ferris twovolumed the african abroad or his evolution in western civilization  john w cromwells the negro in american history  mostly biography john r lynchs the facts of reconstruction  and delilah l beasleys the negro trail blazers of california  in  w e b du bois also started an encyclopedia africana project to commemorate the fiftieth year of the emancipation proclamation  and the th anniversary of the landing of the negro in america  he did not get the financial support he needed to complete the project at that time but he did read a paper on reconstruction and its benefits before the american historical association in  du bois published in  that very important pioneering anthropological book on african history in the home university library series titled the negro and the gift of black folk negroes in the making of america in  the latter had historical chapters on black explorers and other negro subjects another giant of negro history was carter g woodson who worked his way up from former slave parents through the west virginia coal  mines to a phd in history at harvard in  he founded the association for the study of negro life and history in  and published the same year the education of the negro prior to  woodson started the journal of negro history in  and thereafter published by the association in rapid succession a series of volumes of negro history authored or edited by him a century of negro migration  the history of the negro church  the negro in our history  the  edition revised by charles h wesley is the tenth free negro heads of families in the united states in   and the mind of the negro as reflected in letters written during the crisis   a forerunner of herbert apthekers a documentary history of the negro people in the united states  woodson also started the annual celebration of negro history week in  arthur a schomburg in his article the negro digs up his past in alain lockes book the new negro an interpretation  declared that the american negro must remake his past in order to make his future  for him a group tradition must supply compensation for persecution and pride of race the antidote for prejudice this was a part of the credo of the harlem negro renaissance movement of the s schomburgs projected negro history in outline scheduled to appear in  in the bronze booklets series published by the associates in negro folk education washington d c was written but never put into final form for publication as schomburg died in  the manuscript is still held by one of his daughters also during the twenties benjamin g brawley published a social history of the american negro  a a taylor the negro in the reconstruction of virginia  and charles h wesley negro labor in the united states   woodson brought out negro makers of history  fourth edition in  for upper elementary school students monroe n work his definitive a bibliography of the negro in africa and america  reprinted in  and james weldon johnson published black manhattan  a history of the negro in new york negro history was rapidly coming of age and the works of the thirties showed as much there was the white writer paul lewinsons race class and party a history of negro suffrage and white politics in the south  reprinted in  then came w e b du bois great work black reconstruction in america   reprinted in   in paperback and  and the whitie marxist writer james s allens important reconstruction the battle for democracy    reprinted in  and  two books that defended the role of negroes and radical republicans during reconstruction and repudiated the widespread opinion of the period as a tragic era productive only of evil and corruption these two works rescued reconstruction from the dominant white historiography and forced american historians to revise and reconsider their biased work on this period an encyclopedia of the negro edited by du bois and guy b johnson and sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund was started in  but was published only in outline form in  revised edition in  the white writer wilbur h siebert author of the underground railroad  brought out much later his three books of the underground railroad in massachusetts  in vermont  and in ohio  the white anthropologist ina corinne browns the story of the american negro appeared in  revised editions in  and  carter g woodson started the monthly negro history bulletin in  for use in schools and study groups and published the story of the negro retold in  for high school students merle r eppse a negro professor in the south brought out in  the negro too in american history for adults and an elementary history of america for elementary school students the late white marxist historian elizabeth lawson published her very good study outline history of the american negro people  also in  she was later to publish pamphlets on thaddeus stevens  reprinted in  lincolns third party  the peoples almanac  and hiram revels our first negro senator from mississippi  miss lawson was doing a pamphlet on robert brown elliott one of the eight negro reconstruction congressmen from south carolina and a critical study of robert e lee at her death in  the increasing interest in african history during the s and s can be seen in the publication of j a rogers worlds greatest men of african descent  the english translation published by woodson of maurice delafosses the negroes of africa history and culture  carter g woodsons african background outlined  willis n huggins and john g jacksons an introduction to african civilization  and their earlier book a guide to studies in african history  w e b du bois black folk then and now  an enlargement of his earlier study the negro  and melville j herskovits the myth of the negro past  reprinted in  and  a volume in the carnegiemyrdal series the white historian harvey wishs article on negro slave revolts in the journal of negro history  was the first of a series of articles and books to be published on this important subject this was followed by the white marxist historian herbert apthekers articles on the same subject in the magazine science and society   the negro historian joseph c carrolls book slave insurrections in the united states   and herbert apthekers pamphlet negro slave revolts in the united states   apthekers doctoral dissertation and definitive work american negro slaves revolts was published in  and twice reprinted and kept in print by another publisher in  and  aptheker in the meantime had been publishing three other pamphlets the negro in the civil war  the negro in the american revolution  and the negro in the

historians disagreed and thought that franklins claims were greatly exaggerated but some improvement had definitely taken place in the writing of negro history although there was still a long way to go in the s white historians were to do even better on a whole than they had done in the s with of course some serious regressions in both decades which we wont discuss here the civil_rights struggle

perofessor richard bardolph in his book p the negro vanguard vs states that negroes were far from controlling southern politics is attested by the small number sent to washington in the four years following the war congress contained no negroes at all and in the next eight years the average was six during the  reconstruction years   only two negro senators were seated  and  representatives six from south carolina where the black population was heaviest and political activity most aggressive nine of the  former slave states had no negro congress at all in the reconstruction years in the  years  after termination of the radical program negroes averaged only two seats per congress and in the next decade there was never more than one to represent the nations negroes by that time grown to more than n in the south between  and  there were  negro congressmen and two senators namely hiram r revels and blanche k bruce both of mississippi revels was born of free parents in north carolina and bruce was born a slave in virginia see list at end of article which shows births and deaths of all negro congressmen during the period covered by this paper american historians generally have portrayed reconstruction era negro officials as illiterate clowns butlike so much of our history myth was allowed to overshadow fact   hiram rhoades revels was the first negro to serve in the united states senate when revels took his seat in the senate he was fulfilling prophecy senator simon cameron told senator jefferson davis in  when he left the senate after mississippi seceded from the union i believe in the justice of god that a negro some day will come and occupy your seat a short biography of hiram revels will help to explode the myth that reconstruction negro congressmen were not educated and well trained hiram rhoades revels was bom september   at fayetteville n c he was born of free parents so he never knew the condition of servitude he left north carolina when a young man revels moved to indiana and attended the quaker seminary in union county a while later he moved to darke county ohio and attended the seminary there when he had completed this period of education he went to baltimore he was ordained in the african methodist episcopal ministry in  his education was incomplete he went to illinois and graduated from knox college at bloomington after completing his education the young negro taught and lectured to his people in indiana illinois missouri kansas kentucky and tennessee at last he settled in st louis where he taught for a short while later the energetic young minister returned to preaching in cincinnati st louis pittsburgh and baltimore preacher revels was in baltimore when the civil war began he assisted in organizing the first two negro regiments raised in maryland in  revels moved to st louis and founded a large school for freemen the first founded by a negro he helped to recruit a negro regiment in st louis in  he went to mississippi and joined the federal army as chaplain of a negro regiment at the same time he helped the freedmens bureau to extend protection to negro troops chaplain revels crossed over from vicksburg to jackson to establish schools and churches bushwhackers almost captured him but he was warned by friends and managed to escape in  he left the army and went to louisville and then to leavenworth kansas to preach in  revels settled at natchez mississippi where he combined preaching with participation in politics the first republican convention ever held in mississippi met at jackson september   about a third of its members were exslaves revels had been elected as alderman of natchez in  he was elected to the state senate in  at this time revels had received no particular attention from the reconstruction republicans but when the state legislature of mississippi convened in january  preacher revels was called on to open the session with a prayer his prayer was impressive and did much to lead to his election as united states senator the minister had entered politics reluctantly because he feared his participation would cause racial friction he was careful to never  prostitute the pulpit to partisan purposes as some were accused of doing mississippi had no representative in the united states senate after jefferson davis resigned at  the beginning of the civil war when mississippi reentered the union in  revels was elected as a compromise candidate the memphis daily avalanche of january   had this to say about the first negro to serve in the united states senate seven cities contended for the honor of homers birth how many will struggle for revels is yet a question a week ago  people had never heard his name or if heard it was only to be forgotten now it will be the subject of  leaders and when revels reaches washington the reporters of all the great journals will interview him happy revels he is of popular manners and speaks with great ease in his intercourse with all classes he conducts himself with decorousness that has won him the regard of all his neighbors at home and of the members of the mississippi senate of which he is now a member revels did not go to washington to serve a full fouryear term it was an unexpired term to last from february   to march   blanche kelso bruce was the first negro to serve a full term as united states senator when senator revels arrived in washington some members of the mississippi delegation held a party president u s grant and his cabinet members were present grant received revels with much kindness and told him he hoped he would be admitted in the senate without difficulty it was reported that even the radicals of the republican party didnt want a negro in congress when revels credentials were presented to the senate on february  one senator james nye rejoiced in a speech that a negro was replacing jefferson davis this set off a debate that lasted all day and revels was not confirmed on that daythe debate resumed on february  and lasted all day without a decision senator simon cameron made a speech in which he reminded the senate of what he had said in  when jefferson davis left washington see earlier reference the radicals wanted to seat revels in davis old seat for the spectacular effect it would create senator ross of kansas the man who broke the tie vote to impeach andrew johnson as recorded in john f kennedys profiles in courage occupied jefferson davis old seat no  he would not give it up and revels was forced to take  no  on the opposite side of the row a vote of  to  was cast in his favor on february and revels became the first negro to be seated in the united states senate the newspapers and the negro ministers in washington announced that senator revels would give his first speech in the senate on march  the gallery of the senate was packed a writer for the philadelphia press said never since the birth of the republic has such an audience been assembled under one single roof it embraces the greatest and the least american citizens the occasion of revels speech was the readmission of georgia into the union in referring to his race revels managed to get in a word for civil liberties they appeal to you and to me to see that they receive that protection which alone will enable them to pursue their daily avocations and enjoy the liberties of citizenship on the same footing with their white neighbors and friends sir i repeat the fact that the colored race saved the noble women of new england and the middle states many men of whom they lean today for security and safety many of my race representatives of these men on the battlefield sleep in countless graves of the south if those quiet resting places of our honored dead could speak today what a mighty voice like to the rushing of a mighty wind would come up from those sepulchral homes could we resist the eloquent pleadings of their appeal ah sir i think that this question of immediate and ample protection for the loyal people of georgia would lose its technicalities and we would cease to hesitate in our provisions for their instant relief senator revels didnt receive any more attention until the summer of  at this time he appointed a negro to west point the negro cadet who faced intense harassment failed to pass and was soon dropped the nation of june   pronounced it a very foolish and cruel thing as far as the boy and his family were concerned and a very injudicious thing as far as the colored race is concerned the first negro senator introduced two or three minor bills which failed to pass on february   revels gave his last speech in the senate it concerned the mixed schools in the district of columbia which he favored at the conclusion of his speech he said the white race has no better friend than i i am true to my own race    but at the same time i would not have anything done which would harm the white race ® senator revels term came to a close on march   he did not run for reelection alcorn college for negroes was established in mississippi and revels became its first president he was appointed by governor alcorn who had replaced him on the states senate in june  revels went to new orleans to edit the southwestern advocate an organ of the general conference of his church revels then served a second term as president of alcorn college after this he returned to religious work and made his home at holly springs mississippi he became district superintendent of his church and died while attending a church conference at aberdeen mississippi the date was january   thus ended the career of the first negro to serve in the united states senate the year  was the year that george h white a negro native of north carolina went out of office white was the last negro to serve in congress until  so the year  will be the terminal point in this paper extensive coverage of the career of hiram r revels is given to set the stage for comment on other negroes to serve in the united states congress we are now familiar with the conditions of the times which vary little with the other united states senator blanche kelso bruce and the  or so negro congressmen from  to  however their personalities and pronouncements were often at variance with revels as we shall see as already stated revels was bom free and served only part of a term march  blanche kelso bruce only negro to serve full term in united states senate born a slave at prince edward county virginia as a passing comment what if they had closed their schools in the s instead of in the s they would have lost a united states senator from their county even though he removed to mississippi before he became senator the charge that all negro officers were illiterates ignorant of the science of government cannot be sustained some of them had undergone considerable training and had experienced sufficient mental development to be able to discharge their duties with honor    b k bruce was educated at oberlin college this was quite an accomplishment in itself for an exslave allan nevins in writing about reconstruction gives the white mans view of negroes in politics thus the north had gone far beyond the step of merely granting the negro a full participation in the rights and duties of free society it had taken the millions of former slaves almost uni  versally unlettered and ignorant the children of the dark continent and the victims of slavery and had placed them in charge of the delicate and complicated mechanism of modern democracy with power to deal with its laws and its courts    the men most capable of government the able experienced and welleducated whites whom the south had been wont in prewar days to place in office were rigidly excluded from public affairs  i would hope that the great historian allan nevins has grown in his insight of southern white politicians of antebellum days and the reconstruction negro politicians since he wrote the above in  the career of blanche k bruce who may have been exceptional will go a little ways in refuting the judgment of professor nevins a couple of quotes from leading historians at the conclusion of this paper should also help to refute the quote of nevins blanche k bruce was the only negro in american history to serve a regular term in the united states senate edward brooke of massachusetts will be number two he was born a slave in prince edward county virginia march   his mother had been the slave of a wealthy planter and young bruce was a pet and often said he saw none of the horrors of slavery instead he did as he liked and was educated by a tutor    bruce escaped to hannibal missouri there he organized the first school in the country exclusively for negroes after the war he took a special two year course at oberlin college at this point he had more education than andrew jackson andrew johnson and harry truman then he went to mississippi at just the opportune time since there was a good chance there for intelligent and capable men    he also found time to engage in planting on a large scale and became wealthy    these honors made bruce much more logical a candidate than revels had been  he was elected against very weak opposition securing even the votes of three democratic senators bruce was present march   when the special session met and he received more attention than anyone except andrew johnson who had just returned to the senate   on account of a grudge against ames alcorn the white senator of mississippi did not escort his colleague to the desk to be sworn in bruce was embarrassed but was starting up alone when senator conkling noticed it and accompanied him for this bruce was duly grateful and several years later named his only son roscoe conkling bruce had the courage to vote against the wishes of his white colleagues in the senate when he thought something was wrong in their thinking the majority of the senate in  was in favor of the bill to exclude orientals senator bruce came to his feet with the following speech mr president i desire to submit a single remark representing as i do a people who y but a few years ago were considered essentially disqualified from enjoying the privileges and immunities of american citizenship and who have since been so successfully introduced into the body politic and having large confidence in the strength and assimilative power of our institutions i shall vote against the pending bill  i dont see many white southern politicians speaking up for democracy in that way at the time may   bruce had the unusual experience of presiding over the democratic senate for some time  in bruces last session he continued on his same committees but did little else only a few bills were introduced by him and none passed one proposing to buy the freedmans bank property did pass the senate but got no further as his only success he was granted the discarded senate furniture for the use of the home for colored women and children from  to  the time period of this paper there were only two negro senators so i have been able to give considerable space to their careers to illustrate the type of negro who was serving in the senate however during this time there were  negroes who served in the house of representatives therefore i will not use the space to give the careers of all the representatives since hiram r revels a native of north carolina was the first negro to serve in the congress and george h white a native of north carolina was the last negro to serve in the congress during the period of this paper i will go into the career of white to illustrate the type of negro who was serving in the house george white was elected to congress at a time when the south was doing her utmost to disfranchise the negro by this time white served from  to  even the republican party had turned its back on the negro if reconstruction left its mark on white america it also affected  jk black americas political life and means of earning a living reconstruction made the negro a republican as has been noted in the words of frederick douglass the republican party was the deck and all else was the sea a goodly number of negroes became democrats but they had to bear the reproaches of their fellow negroes and sometime even the contempt of whites of their own party just before the turn of the century the nation turned a deaf ear to the negro when the south went into an allout drive to return to precivil war white supremacy president mckinley made no public pronouncement on the big race riot at wilmington n c where negroes were being prevented from voting north carolina passed a constitutional amendment which disfranchised negroes and once again mckinley remained silent dr rayford w logan writes it is appropriate that the last negro congressman of the postreconstruction era completed his term at the end of mckinleys first administration two negroes had been members of the house and one of the senate  five had been members of the house  and seven     from  to  there had been two negro congressmen in each session from  to  three and from that time to  only one the last of these george h white of north carolina had been elected during the fusionist campaign of  and was returned in the election of  despite the white supremacy campaignwhich even josephus daniels was to regret in his old age  representative george white was among the better negro orators and he was not afraid to speak his mind it is worth noting some things he said in congress in  on the day following washingtons birthday he white asked should not a nation be just to all her citizens protect them alike in all their rights on every foot of her soilin a word show herself capable of governing all within her domain before she undertakes to exercise sovereign authority over those of a foreign land    should not charity begin at home  white was referring to acquisition of territories and peoples after the spanishamerican war of  congressman white in one of his best speeches made a fullscale sally upon the breastwords of mob law and lynching   we have struggled on as best we could with the odds against us at every turn our constitutional rights have been trodden under foot    fully  of my race have been ignominously murdered by mobs not  percent of whom have been made to answer for their crimes in the courts of justice and even here in the nations capitalin the senate and housesenators and representatives have undertaken the unholy task of extenuating and excusing these foul deeds and in some instances they have gone so far as to justify them  the white supremacy people of the south and also many of their white brothers of the north had been used to negroes being seen at the back door and not heard one of the reasons the negro had been accused of being an ignorant and uneducated legislator was not so much his ignorance but the fact that he had not been allowed to  speak out so whites statements made the southern white raging mad on february   he white quoted on the floor of the house a diatribe in josephus daniels raleigh news and observer one typical sentence read it is bad enough that north carolina should have the only nigger congressman on march   both houses of the north carolina legislature noted with speeches of thanksgiving that whites term in the united states congress had ended  white had realized that enough negroes had been disfranchised in north carolina and white supremacy had gained strong enough foothold that his reelection would be futile he did not put himself up for reelection when george h white of north carolina the last of the postcivil war congressmen finished his term in  he predicted in a moving valedictory that the negro would return his phophecy was fulfilled when oscar de priest of chicago was elected in  to the first of three terms samuel d smith author of the negro in congress  who rarely found negro members worthy of commendation paid white a mild tribute when he said that the valedictory would have been an excellent one had the note of bitterness not been so strong always in whites estimation the white race was wrong and the negro the innocent victim the speech was a better one than smith was willing to concede in view of the plight of the negro at that time it was relatively restrained in his conclusion white made a prediction that has today been fulfilled the thesis in this paper has been that negro congressmen   were most times worthy and fully qualified for their positions so for a conclusion i will quote some reliable people on how they saw the negro congressmen   their responsible conduct moved james g blaine their contemporary to observe the colored men who took their seats in both senate and house did not appear ignorant or helpless they were as a rule studious earnest ambitious men whose public conduct    would be honorable to any race  
the africans who came to the united states as slaves started can heritage soon after they arrived in this country they were searching for the lost identity that the slave system has destroyed concurrent with the black mans search for an identity in america has been his search for an identity in the world which means in essence his identity as a human being with a history before and after slavery that can command respect some afroamericans gave up the search and accepted the distorted image of themselves that had been created by their oppressors as early as  dr edward wilmot blyden the great west indian scholar and benefactor of west africa addressed himself to this situation when he said in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary school books geographies travels histories    having embraced or at least assented to those falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes despite the alienation spoken of here by dr blyden the afroamericans spiritual trek back to africa continued dr w e b du bois the elder statesman among the afroamericans addressed himself to the broader aspects of this situation on the occasion of the celebration of the second anniversary of the asianafrican bandung conference and the rebirth of ghana on april   when he said from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries the africans imported to america regarded themselves as temporary settlers destined to return eventually to africa their increasing revolts against the slave system which culminated in the eighteenth century showed a feeling of close kinship to the motherland and even well into the nineteenth century they called their organizations african as witness the african unions of new york and newport and the african churches of philadelphia and new york in the west indies and south america there was even closer indication of feelings of kinship with africa and the east the planters excuse for slavery was advertised as conversion of africa to christianity but soon american slavery appeared based on the huge profits of the sugar empire and the cotton kingdom as plans were laid for the expansion of the slave system the slaves themselves sought freedom by increasing revolt which culminated in the th century in haiti they won autonomy in the united states they fled from the slave states in   f  t «  the south to the free states in the north and to canada t here the free negroes helped form the abolition movement and when that seemed to be failing the negroes began to plan for migration to africa haiti and south america civil war and emancipation intervened and american negroes looked forward to becoming free and equal citizens here with no thought of return to africa or of kinship with the worlds darker peoples however the rise of the negro was hindered by disfranchisement lynching and caste legislation there was some recurrence of the back to africa idea and increased sympathy for darker folk who suffered the same sort of caste restrictions as american negroes during the eighteenth century there was strong agitation among certain groups of black people in america for a return to africa this agitation was found mainly among groups of free negroes because of the uncertainty of their position as freedmen in a slaveholding society one can see it late into the eighteenth century dr du bois explains in his book dust of dawn when the negro union of newport rhode island in  proposed to the free african society of philadelphia a general exodus to africa on the part of at least free negroes the back to africa idea has been a reoccuring theme in afroamerican life and thought for more than a hundred years this thought was strong during the formative years of the colonization society and succeeded in convincing some of the most outstanding black men of the eighteenth and nineteenth century such as john russwurm the first negro college graduate bowdoin  and lott carey the powerful virginia preacher later the society fell into severe disrepute after an argument with the abolitionists  two freedom struggles emerged early in the nineteenth century one african one afroamerican while the africans were engaged in their wars against colonialism the american blacks were engaged in slave revolts some slaves took the christian version of the bible seriously and believed that god meant all men to be free such a slave was gabriel prosser of virginia who felt that he was inspired by god to lead his people to freedom over  slaves were involved in his revolt of  before it was betrayed in  in charleston s c a carpenter denmark vesey planned one of the most extensive revolts against slavery ever recorded he too was betrayed and afterwards put to death along with  of his followers in  the greatest slave revolt of all occurred in virginia led by nat turner a plowman and a preacher whose father had escaped to freedom in  joseph cinque the son of a mendi king in sierra leone west africa was sold into slavery and shipped to cuba cinque and his fellow africans revolted on board the ship and ordered the ships owners to sail to africa the spanish owners of the ship steered northward when they were not being watched and eventually landed off the coast of long island the africans were arrested and sent to new haven conn where they were put on trial when the trial began there was great excitement in the country people talked about the case and took sides southern politicians wanted to give the africans back to the spaniards who had bought them the trial lasted all winter in court cinque made a wonderful speech in his own language telling the story of how he and his men had fought to be free after that speech the court ordered the africans set free cinque and his men were sent to school to be educated and were found to be intelligent and quick to learn meanwhile the two spaniards and the spanish government appealed to the united states supreme court to have the africans returned to them as slaves the friends of cinque and his men asked john quincy adams the former president of the united states and a great lawyer to speak for the africans on march   j after adams had spoken chief justice taney of the supreme  court ruled that cinque and the others were to be freed after that cinque continued his schooling and in  he and his men returned to africa all america had been stirred by this case the slave owners feared that the news about the freedom and return to africa of cinque and his fellow africans would cause their slaves to revolt and also demand to be returned to their homeland in the years before the civil  war plans for the migration of the free negroes back to africa were revived and agents were sent to south america haiti and africa paul cuffe a free black ship owner from new bedford massachusetts had founded the friendly society for the emigration of free negroes from america and had taken a large number back to africa at his own expense in the middle of the nineteenth century while the issue of slavery was being debated in most of the country the feeling for africa among american blacks was growing stronger publications like freedoms journal and douglass monthly edited by frederick douglass called attention to the plight of the people of africa as well as the black americans i thank god for making me a man simply but delaney always thanks him for making him a black man this spoke frederick douglass of his old friend martin r delaney spokesman physician explorer and scientist martin r delaney was proud of his african background and the mandingo blood that flowed in his veins he was one of the leaders of the great debate following the passage of the fugitive slave act in  he was the spokesman for the black people who felt that the bitter racial climate in america had made life for them in this country unbearable delaney was the strongest voice in several conventions of free neuroes to discuss plans for emigrating to africa in  he led the first and only exploratory party of americanborn africans to the land of their forefathers in the region of the niger river in the area that became nigeria delaneys party carried out scientific studies and made agreements with several african kings for the settlement of emigrants from america this interest in africa was continued under the leadership of men like rev alexander crummell and bishop henry mcneal turner during the latter part of the nineteenth century edward wilmot blyden a native of what was then the danish west indies called attention to the important role that africa could play in emerging world affairs he was convinced that the only way to bring respect and dignity to his people was by building progressive new empires in africa he was of the opinion that the new world negro has a great future in africa he saw liberia in west africa as the ideal place where africanamericans could build a new and great civilization by making use of the things that they had learned in the west and preserving the best of the african way of life because of his j  and the work of many others the african consciousness was translated into useful programs of service to africa afroamerican institutions of higher learning joined in this service through their training of the personnel of the churches as well as their support of africans studying in their institutions the idea of uniting all africa had its greatest development early in this century in  a west indian lawyer h sylvester williams called together the first panafrican conference in london this meeting attracted attention and put the word panafrican in the dictionaries for the first time the  delegates to the conference came mainly from england the west indies and the united states the small delegation from the united states was led by w e b du bois this meeting had no deep roots in africa itself and the movement and the idea died for a generation then came the first world war at the close of this war w e b du bois led the determined agitation for the rights of african people throughout the world particularly in africa meetings were held and a petition was sent to president wilson who was meeting with other leaders of the western world at the peace congress in versailles dr du bois went to paris with the idea of calling a panafrican congress for the purpose of im pressing upon the members of the peace congress setting in versailles the importance of africa in the future world in spite of being without credentials and influence some attention was paid to the idea president wilsons assistant colonel house was sympathetic but noncommittal the chicago tribune said january   in dispatch from paris dated december   an ethiopian utopia to be fashioned out of the german colonies is the latest dream of leaders of the negro race who are here at the invitation of the united states government as part of the extensive entourage of the american peace delegation robert r moton successor of the late booker t washington as head of tuskegee institute and dr william e b du bois editor of the crisis are promoting a panafrican conference to be held here during the winter while the peace conference is on full blast it is to embrace negro leaders from america abyssinia liberia haiti and the french and british colonies and other parts of the black world its object is to get out of the peace conference an effort to modernize the dark continent and in the world reconstruction to provide international machinery looking toward the civilization of the african natives the negro leaders are not agreed upon any definite plan but dr du bois has mapped out a scheme which he has presented in the form of memorandum to president wilson it is quite utopian and it has less than a chinamans chance of getting anywhere in the peace conference but it is nevertheless interesting as selfdetermination is one of the words to conjure with in paris nowadays the negro leaders are seeking to have it applied if possible in a measure to their race in africa dr du bois dream is that the peace conference could form an internationalized africa to have as its basis the former german colonies with their  square miles and  population to this his plan reads could be added by negotiation the   square miles and  inhabitants of portuguese africa it is not impossible that belgium could be persuaded to add to such a state the  square miles and  natives of the congo making an international africa with over  square miles of land and over  people this africa for the africans could be under the guidance of international organization the governing international commission should represent not simply governments but modem culture science commerce social reform and religious philanthropy it must represent not simply the white world but the civilized negro world with these two principles the practical policies to be followed out in the government of the new states should involve a thorough and complete system of modern education built upon the present government religion and customary law of the churches within ten years  black children ought to be in school within a generation young africa should know the essential outlines of modern culture from the beginning the actual general government should use both coloured and white officials  w e b du bois wrote extensively about the idea of panafricanism and the world unity of people of african descent this is the essence of his statement on the intent of the panafrican congress of  this congress represented africa partially of the  delegates from fifteen countries nine were african countries with  delegates the other delegates came from the united states which  sent  and the west indies with  most of these delegates did not come to france for this meeting but happened to be residing there mainly for reasons connected with the war america and all the colonial powers refused to issue special visas the congress influenced the peace conference the new york evening globe february nd  described it as the first assembly of the kind in history and has for its object the drafting of an appeal to the peace conference to give the negro race of africa a chance to develop unhindered by other races seated at long green tables in the council room today were negroes in the trim uniform of american army officers other american coloured men in frock coats or business suits polished french negroes who hold public office senegalese who sit in the french chamber of deputies    the congress specifically asked that the german colonies be turned over to an international organization instead of being handled by the various colonial powers out of this idea came the mandates commission the resolution of the congress said in part a that the allied and associated powers establish a code of law for the international protection of the natives of africa similar to the proposed international code for labor b that the league of nations establish a permanent bureau charged with the special duty of overseeing the application of these laws to the political social and economic welfare of the natives c the negroes of the world demand that hereafter the natives of africa and the peoples of african descent be governed according to the following principles  the land and its natural resources shall be held in trust for the natives and at all times they shall have effective ownership of as much land as they can profitably develop  capital the investment of capital and granting of concessions shall be so regulated as to prevent the exploitation of the natives and the exhaustion of the natural wealth of the country concessions shall always be limited in time and subject to state control the growing social needs of the natives must be regarded and the profits taxed for social and material benefit of the natives  labor slavery and corporal punishment shall be abolished and forced labor except in punishment for crime and the general conditions of labor shall be prescribed and regulated by the state  education it shall be the right of every native child to learn to read and write his own language and the language of the trustee nation at public expense and to be given technical instruction in some branch of industry the state shall also educate as large a number of natives as possible in higher technical and cultural training and maintain a corps of native teachers     the state the natives of africa must have the right to participate in the government as far as their development permits in conformity with the principle that the government exists for the natives and not the natives for the government they shall at once be allowed to participate in local and tribal government according to ancient usage and this participation shall gradually extend as education and experience proceeds to the higher offices of state to the end that in time africa be ruled by consent of the africans    whenever it is proven that african natives are not receiving just treatment at the hands of any state or that any state deliberately excludes its civilized citizens or subjects of negro descent from its body politic and cultural it shall be the duty of the league of nations to bring the matter to the civilized world the idea of panafrica having thus been established dr du bois now attempted to build a real organization the panafrica movement began to represent growth and development soon the du bois approach to panafricanism was challenged by the approach of marcus garvey the national association for the advancement of colored people began its interest in africa with support of the various panafrican congresses called by dr du bois the african and afroamerican freedom struggle that had met and joined forces briefly in the nineteenth century was now meeting again in the twentieth century two great personalities were bringing the message of africas awakening to the worlds attention both of them were saying in different ways that africa was great once and will be great again both of them told the afroamericans that they had a part to play in africas redemption the two personalities were w e b dubois and marcus garvey the italianethiopian war renewed interest in africa this interest sustained and was increased when in  the gold coast gained its independence and took back its ancient nameghana black american grassroots identification with african problems burst upon the international scene during the first congo crisis when a group of black nationalists created a disturbance in the galleries of the united nations in protest against alleged u n connivance in the  murder of patrice lumumba this identification with african political affairs amongst the black masses reached its zenith with the visit to africa by malcolm_x shortly before his death and his effort to enlist the support of the organization of african unity this growing interest in africa and a rediscovery of the lost african heritage launched the spread of black consciousness among young civil_rights militants out of this feeling the concept of black_power was bom
he tend to read history t os not our ey es  ut  tv r with our prejudices so £ y said wendell phillips more than a century ago in his eulogy on toussaint louverture the black liberator of haiti phillips did not live to see the day of unprejudiced history for he died in  when carter g woodson had not yet reached his teens but thanks to woodson who in  began to resurrect the negro past succeeding generations of americans would increasingly begin to read history with their eyes the result is that today we are witnessing somewhat of a boom in negro history a boom which shows no signs of abating the movement grows apace to make our countrys history less white and more american today as never before there is a mounting realization that not all colored folks were picking cotton in the southland before or after appomattox in the words of herbert hill this increasing interest in the historical negro embraces all manner of menthe scholar in his study the teacher in the classroom the parent in the home and the negro masses who have come to have a new image of themselves the larger general public has not been immune to this revitalized study of the negro past to the idea that the negro has been a mover and shaker in our history if negro history is here to stay one of the reasons is the behavior of the presentday negro the current civil_rights revolution has brought with it a heightened interest in the negros role in the american past within the negro community itself there has been a growing pride in the negro heritage a sentiment shared alike by the rank and file and the talented tenth of w e b du bois negroes who are no longer ashamed of their skin color or hair texture are not likely to be ashamed of their past proud acceptance of ones self makes for proud acceptance of ones past reflecting this spirit some civil_rights groups have brought out brief negro histories realizing the importance of supplying the missing pages from the agenda of the past negro history looms large in the portfolio of the freedom movement indeed a basic premise of the freedom schools was that our nations history was by no means the creation of whites only another grassroots effort that may be noted is the establishing of negro history museums often under the leadership of writers artists or teachers negro parent groups have been active particularly in urging school boards to bestir themselves these parents have called for a better portrayal of the negro in the history textbooks and in other teaching materials in some instances this effort has been supported by farseeing white parents who wish to bring their children up without prejudice and who realize that prejudice feeds upon ignorance and distorted information school boards in our big cities seem to have got the message they have scrutinized history textbooks more carefully making sure that the negro is seen in proper perspective some school systems have revised their course outlines in the social studies to include negrorelated materials in new york city the board of education has set up a human relations unit designed to promote better schoolcommunity feeling one of the units most helpful publications has been a page mimeographed pamphlet on the negro in american history a number of other school systems likewise have prepared special negro history booklets and guides some city systems have set up negro history workshops designed for social studies teachers primarily but open to others that the nature of american history is changing is recognized by the testing services that construct examinations for entrance into college and for job placement increasingly the examinations constructed by these agencies will have essay and multiple choice questions relating to the negro predictably the first negroes to appear in these tests may be nonmilitants like phillis wheatley and george washington carver but inevitably frederick douglass harriet tubman and w e b du bois will appear and who knows one day malcolm_x and the black_power dissidents may even make their appearance in higher education it is to be noted that some colleges and graduate schools are for the first time scheduling courses in negro history a number of other such institutions are seeking fulltime professors of african history and negro american history the world of business has become aware of negro history last spring the wall street journal carried a frontpagearticle entitled the black past written by a staff reporter peter h prugh its opening lines ran like this the list of titles published by the book companies reflects this increase of interest in the negro and for the childrens market we may expect negro history coloring books possibly bearing the title color me colored for children too a negro history game of the old maid type has made its appearance in this game there are  picture cards consisting of  pairs of pictures of such worthies as crispus attucks prince hall and john b russwurm there is a single card labeled uncle tom de picting an oldster with a hangdog expression and the player who winds up with this card loses the game big business firms have sensed that negro history is good public relations one firm for example has brought out for free distribution a travelers guide to negro history another firm has brought out a booklet about notable negro women of the past and still another has produced a negro history cartoon book negro history has been found of use to our countrys policymakers the national advisory commission on civil disorders as it began its hearings in september  devoted an entire afternoon to an examination of the negros past in america men in political life are coming to realize the importance of knowing something about the historical negro no politician it has been said can win a major office in america without first getting right with lincoln but humor aside candidates for public office in our major cities may find it important to have at least a bowing acquaintance with a few negro heroes past as well as present especially those of local derivation a major and final reason for the promising future of negro history is that it has attracted the attention of the world of scholarship historians can perform no service more useful to society writes j g randall than to expose faulty or vicious generalizations about history that continue to mislead mankind and historians have come to realize that one of the aspects of history about which people have been badly informed up to now has been the role of the negro for the historians are finding him in whatever phase of the american past they choose to focus upon be it exploration war government invention culture or sports the depth of the negros involvement in our history is suggested in earle e thorpes observation slight the negro in studies or theories on southern history and the truth is always missed another presentday historian wesley frank craven in his the legend of the founding fathers expresses the same thought in the form of a question who among us can wander down the streets of williamsburg with promptings on every side to remember washington and jefferson and still remember that it all rested originally upon the back of a negro in history circles the current stress on urban history will certainly bring the negro more to the fore scholars are now paying much more attention than ever before to the rise of cities in america and their profound impact on our national life in such studies it will hardly be possible to bypass the negro who since the turn of the century has become increasingly an urban dweller a proportion rising from onequarter in  to threequarters today in addition to including the negro in general portrayals of city life writers of history have been turning out books in which the urban negro is the central character such works include richard wades study of slavery in the cities of the south gilbert osofskys description of harlem from  to  and allen h spears treatment of black chicago covering much the same period from the pages of these writers we are learning that many of the problems faced by the urban negro stemmed from his role as a newcomer hence to view the urban negro as a man seeking to make an adjustment in a new environment would seem to be a sounder explanation of his experience than to view him as some have done as the product of a broken unstable family or as having some other deeply ingrained folk pattern peculiar to americans of color another phase of the past that is undergoing significant historical revision is the history of africa before columbus the ancestral homelands of the negro american are now undergoing historical redefinition making use of newer nontraditional techniques researchers are providing more and more information on early africa and when the dark continent is seen in its true light the history of the west coast peoples who were transplanted to the new world the afroamericans will likewise be illumined the upsurge of scholarly interest in negro american history is clearly revealed by the number of articles now being written about it the number of scholars who read papers at the recent annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history is but a portion of those who had expressed a willingness to appear the number of learned papers being produced far outruns the publication capacity of the journal of negro history plus the other negroedited quarterlies phylon and the journal of negro education happily the other learned periodicals are publishing negro articles more and more one of the hurdles facing the researcher in negro history is a lack of readily accessible information happily here too there are signs of change the ford foundation for example has established a civil_rights documentation project whose aim is to collect information on the civil_rights movement of our times this body of data including oral history and unpublished material will be made available to future researchers the chairman of the ford committee is ralphe j bunche its members include margaret mead and john hope franklin and its director is vincent j browne another significant project designed to aid scholars is the editing of the voluminous papers of booker t washington this undertaking is headed by louis r harlan under the sponsorship of the university of maryland and launched by an initial grant from the national endowment for the humanities in time the scholarly study of the negro should profit from the relatively new warren center for the study of the history of liberty in america located at harvard the center is headed by oscar handlin author of firebell in the night a work bearing the explanatory subtitle the crisis in civil_rights the work of the historical guild is worth noting because its output is likely to be based upon the best knowledge available at the time the professionallyminded historian is wedded to the idea that truth is the whole he seeks better history better often because more inclusive inevitably this better history will reflect the viewpoint that the negro has been a protagonist of significant historical action time out of mind and this fact the true historian would not wish to ignore for in his search for the significant past he welcomes such a fresh element of vitality his vision thus enlarged the historian may then with due modesty proceed to fashion his small footnote to the vast repository of the written word
black resistance in colonial haiti
haiti was called st domingue when it was a french colony from about  to the s when the slaves revolted abolished slavery and wrested their independence st domingue was frances most valuable colony france became wealthy and powerful by engaging in the slave trade and by shipping processing and selling on the european market the sugar coffee and other products produced by the slaves of st domingue the haitian revolution led by toussaint louverture was the only successful slave revolt in history and the first successful independence movement in latin america governments like to give the impression that they are allpowerful the policy makers know better there arent enough police there arent enough soldiers to control a people which does not recognize the authority of the government and organizes effectively against it this is true in south vietnam today it was true in colonial haiti governments must mystify their subjects with symbols of authority with brainwashing religions and with bribes and threats to keep the people divided the people must largely accept the values of the government or there can be no real stability force alone is never enough french control in st domingue was always weak because the slaves created their own institutions for coping with slavery the official documents of the french colonial administration tell us something about the avenues of freedom which the slaves managed to open up even under slavery the market was very important to the economic social and religious life of west africa and the slaves skilled in buying and selling controlled the internal market of the colony the french colonists depended upon the slaveoperated markets to trade goods within the colony especially to provide the cities and towns with food the market was held on sundays and holidays and the noise interfered with religious services but the colonial authorities had to recognize that the colony depended upon these slaveoperated markets the famous code noir black code of  outlawed the slaveoperated markets but the french colonists protested that they were absolutely necessary to the commerce of the colony and the french government changed the law the next year and allowed the slaveoperated markets to continue the code noir of  denied all property rights to slaves article  said the west african brought with him his own ideas about property which were not as clearcut as those of the french in dahomey which had the greatest cultural influence in haiti everything belonged in theory to the king land horses implements slaves money even the person of the subject but no king would dare claim his rights out of fear of the ancestors there were two other types of property one was the property of the sib or the extended family it was owned collectively and administered by the oldest male member of the sib the other was private property which could be held by men or women it included houses built trees planted regardless on whose land money earned produce of labor utensils guns mats pipes and magic charms consisting often of herbs and medicines discovered by hunters in the forest who then could sell the formula to others there were complex rules for inheritance of personal property the slaves never accepted the french ideas about property and used their control of the internal market to buy freedom for themselves and their fellow slaves from the french point of view it was wholesale theft and dealing on the black market and they passed many laws to try to curb these operations they required slaves to have a written permit from their masters authorizing them to sell certain things anyone buying goods from a slave without a permit from his master was subject to fine imprisonment and even corporal punishment slaves were forbidden to sell sugar cane even with the masters permission it was hard to enforce pass laws because most of the french colonists were illiterate the colonial administration could never control the black market some of the documents describe how it operated one document complains that the slaves were stealing indigo and other merchandise which was easy to carry and selling to black market operators traveling from plantation to plantation and this trade was thriving so much that the public markets were poorly attended another document describes the operations of the black market  another way for the slaves to get money was monopoly price fixing especially of food sold in the cities and towns another document complains that there were was motivated by the desire for freedom and they tried to control the black market by forbidding masters to free their slaves in return for money explaining why emancipation without government consent were being outlawed they said    most of the disorders that occur in the french islands among the slaves come from the facility which the colonists have of giving them freedom in return for sums of money which they agree upon with their said slaves some even abandon the service of their masters engaging in private affairs under the pretext of working by the day in return for a small recompense which they promise to their said masters others abandon themselves to all kinds of vices to amass the sums agreed upon getting together and carrying on their commerce in the houses of those who have already been freed most of them having cabarets even among whites who are low enough to receive them day and night traffic with them and suffer their infamous and immodest commerce and this is very common in spite of the ordonnances and the prohibitions already made published and posted but this did not help and laws continued to be passed throughout the colonial period to try to control theft and the black market flight was an even more effective means of organized resistance the slaves ran away to the spanish part of the island where they were safe and to colonies of runaway slaves called marons up in the mountains they built towns cultivated the soil raided the plantations and defended themselves from assault by the french they sent messengers to the plantations to encourage other slaves to escape the french authorities knew that the marons were a serious threat to french rule emilien petit a member of the conseils superieurs des colonies wrote in  a colony which has the misfortune to have to fear establishments of slave deserters enters from that moment into a state of war the danger of which can only increase with time documents show that in spite of the brutal penalties passed for flight the french could not control the situation in march  we read the island finding itself devastated by fugitive slaves the council orders that we negotiate with francisque slave of mr fabulet and leader of a large band the conditions of this treaty are that francisque will have his freedom and a thousand pounds of tobacco and that no punishment be inflicted upon the members of his band from     there is a large number of fugitive slaves who have committed several disorders and violences taking cattle stealing food crops and kidnapping even people passing along the highways and we have learned that these negroes live in common in the woods where they have plantations under cultivation houses built and food planted rewards were offered for the capture of fugitive slaves mutilation of he leg and even death become penalties for flight raiding parties were organized against the maron colonies in  we read that the divers raid which we have ordered against the marons negroes have not had the success that was expected and larger detachments are ordered into the field masters are told that slaves found off their property without a pass will be shot on sight but the fugitive slave colonies continued to grow and prosper in  we hear the following complaint    escaped slaves have a way of getting together in the woods and living there exempt from service to their masters under leaders whom they elect among themselves others hiding themselves in the canefields during the day await the night to rob passersby on the highways and go from plantation to plantation taking cattle which they find to eat or hide themselves in the cabins of their comrades who ordinarily participate in their thefts knowing what goes on in their masters house and advising the said fugitive slaves so that they can take their measures for the said thefts without being noticed by  we hear of mass desertions    the number of slaves who have become marons for the past few years and especially during the war is excessive because of their libertinage they leave in bands and desert to the foreigners with whom we were at war so that several of the colonists have had the misfortune of seeing themselves deprived of the cultivation of their lands and reduced to seeking the help of their friends to provide for their families and it is certain that in none of the neighborhoods the enemy has not taken so many as those who have given themselves of voluntarily and that a great number who remain do so only for the return of some and the desertion of others from the island  in  a militia is organized to cope with »¦     the disorders of the maron negroes which increase every day in the neighborhood of cap and cause great prejudice by the establishments they make in the mountains    obliging us to search all means to destroy them and procure to the colonists tranquility in their work and security in their neighborhoods m m m      r  in  the marechausee a permanent body of troops to fight the marons was first organized the reason    the negro slaves desert every day with arms and horses and everything they can steal from their masters or from other colonists and even join together in large numbers to be in condition to defend themselves if anyone attempts to stop them and it has already happened several times that thus assembled or alone armed or unarmed they leave from all over the island and go to the spaniards where they are perfectly well received and from where it is impossible to get them back    and the news of this favorable reception from the spaniards has spread among the rest either through spanish agents or by means of the negroes themselves sent back to foment desertion this reception has made in their minds an impression which tends towards a general revolt and by consequence the total ruin of the colonists of cap and even the loss of the entire colony   in their desperation the administrators became more savage the heads of negroes shot were to be exposed upon pikes any colonist could shoot and kill any negro who he met at night who refuses to stop when first commanded to do so masters were to keep all arms and munitions under lock and key spaniards entering the colony were warned not to speak to nor have any kind of business with any slave under penalty of being thrown into jail at once prices were put on the heads of certain leaders of fugitive slaves in  a price was put on the head of a slave named noel who has assembled a considerable number of slaves around him notably several foremen of different slave gangs and he has succeeded in so frightening the colored people that they no longer dare present themselves before him the colonial authorities committed mass tortures and executions in ¦ public to terrorize the slaves there are many examples this is only one it is a judgment against  slaves men and women blacks and mulattoes    hand cut off before the church drawn and quartered by four horses this done their members thrown into the fire and their ashes into the wind and their heads exposed on pikes planted across from the cabaret where the assassination was committed the said accused first to be subjected to interrogation under ordinary and extraordinary torture the executioner was a slave who had been condemned to death and was offered his life in return for being what was euphemistically called the executioner des hautes oeuvres the executioner of exalted works moreau de stmery said that several slaves when offered this choice preferred death the executioner was not very popular and upon at least one occasion the population got its revenge a document dating from  tells us that on the occasion of the execution of the sentence of death against d the condemned escaped and the executioner was murdered in the town square by the outraged crowd and in its impotent rage the authorities forbade all persons of whatever quality or condition they may be to interfere with the executions of justice by excesses violences and emotions directly or indirectly under penalty of being pursued extraordinarily but they never found a culprit to pin the blame on all over the americas slaveholding nations tried to detach the slaves from their tribal gods they outlawed certain dances the beating of drums slave priests and herb doctors the possession of fetishes music at funerals and sometimes even marriage and funeral ceremonies in the spanish colonies where the slave population was relatively thin conversion to catholicism and education in that faith was considered the best way of controlling the slaves the french tried that in st domingue but it didnt work the slaves selected what they wanted from catholicism but continued to use their tribal gods to subvert the social order melville herskovits said in africa the conquest of one people by another meant the mutual interchange of acceptance of the respective deities the conquerors added to their own pantheons the gods of those whom they had conquered so that these forces might not wreak a supernatural vengeance upon them while to the conquered the power of the gods of those who had defeated them was selfevident this willingness to accept other gods indicates a flexibility which the french did not possess in other respects as well the west african tradition gave the slaves extraordinary psychological strength dahomean myths stress astuteness in the face of great power maintaining a sense of humor not judging by appearances realism in all relationships discretion in speech resiliency in social situations taking steps to meet problems forseen the west african is not a fatalist herskovits said    neither gods nor men are pawns in an allordering system where individuals are endowed with supernatural powers they derive these from spiritual helpers who respond when they are called on but the individual is not moved like a marionette by these powers the slaves of st domingue were to use a current cliche highly motivated and sometimes the french came to believe in the occult powers of their slaves some masters believing that their slaves were sorcerers burned them alive or killed them by breaking their bones with clubs or hammers we quote a judgment against colas jambes coupees legless colas    known for his maronages to the spanish seducing and carrying off other slaves leader of an armed band highway robber in broad daylight as well as at night    attacking even whites having several intelligences and secret correspondences to abolish the colonies instigator or accomplice in the gangs of cezar jupiter louis and cheri all of whom were punished with extreme torture and death accused furthermore of sorcery and magic for having a number of times escaped from irons and prisons and having poisoned several negroes and since all his crimes and his life are known all over the area and by everyone in the most minute detail    the judgment calls for his prompt torture and execution before he escapes again drugs herbs and poisons were used on a grand scale by the slaves who knew more about these matters than did the authorities emilien petit suggested that slaves be given their freedom who have denounced and procured the discovery of unknown poisons and made possible the arrest and punishment of the authors promoters and accomplices of these unknown poisonings because of the loss of a great number of whites slaves and cattle dead of poisoning before one had often before one could have discovered the manner or the authors of these crimes and because of the danger of communicating this secret from one area to another the most widespread conspiracy using poison as its major weapon was the one masterminded by macandal who was burned alive by the authorities in  the judgment against him convicted him of    rendering himself feared among the negroes and corrupting and seducing them through his prestige and inducing them to commit impieties and profanations to which he delivered himself as well in mixing sacred things in the composition and use of packets pretended to be magic and tending towards evil deeds which he made and sold to negroes and having furthermore composed sold and distributed all types of poisons they were especially shocked because macandal used incense holy water and small crucifixes as well as herbes and poisons in the fetishes he sold after the macandal conspiracy the french colonists seemed to have lost all enthusiasm for converting the slaves to catholicism they passed the following law all colonists are forbidden to allow the superstitutious assemblies and ceremonies which certain slaves are accustomed to hold at the death of one among them and which they improperly call prayers all freedmen and slaves are forbidden to compose sell distribute or buy fetishes or macandals so fearful did the colonists become of assemblies of slaves that the use of christian churches by them was severely restricted in spite of the protests of the jesuit missionaries claiming that the temples of god have become the temporary refuge of fugitive slaves and serve often as a theatre of prostitution the authorities ordered all churches closed to slaves after sundown and between noon and  pm no religious offices even minor ones could be held by slaves to protect the security of the colony no slave free black or mulatto could preach either in towns or in the countryside the slaves of st domingue resisted fiercely because it was a matter of life or death they had to be lucky to survive conditions in the slavetrading ships and pens they had to be even luckier to survive conditions on the plantations especially on the sugar plantations during the grinding season which lasted seven or eight months out of the year the slaves were driven day and night with only a few hours to sleep they were so overworked that pere labat an expert on how to run a sugar plantation advised planters to keep a long sharp knife near the canegrinding machines to cut off the arms of slaves who fell asleep and got their fingers caught in the grinders since the machines could not be stopped in time and the slave would be pulled through the grinders only his head falling off slaves should be forced to sing to stay awake so they would not fall into the boiling cauldrons of syrup the slaves were always hungry and neglected when they were sick because the planters believed it was more profitable to work a slave to death and then buy a new one instead of going to the expense of giving him food rest and medical attention the average working life of a slave was seven years french slave law held that a master could punish his slave only by giving him up to  blows with a switch or a rope but there is one case of a master who murdered over  of his slaves some by what was called total mutilation the master was fined and allowed to keep the rest of his slaves masters tortured and burned alive their slaves suspected of being poisoners forcing them to reveal the names of their accomplices real or imaginary who were in turn tortured and burned alive the slaves were faced with cold calculated conscienceless exploitation and an early grave a fate not very different from that of black youth in our ghettoes today only the form is different no one sees no one knows but death is the great dissolver of irrelevancies the slaves of st domingue were able to resist effectively and finally win their freedom when the right moment came because they never accepted the values of the white colonists and because the black underworld played a largely protective role towards the black community it exploited the white community for the benefit of the black in the united states today it works the other way around the black underworld exploits the black community for the benefit of the white underworld maybe because the black underworld is too attached to the symbols of success and worthiness held by the white world to use its extraordinary talents for the benefit of the black community
if you have not read the novel the confessions of nat turner random house  by william styron before you do i suggest you read thomas greys confessions of nat turner  in which nat turner a negro slave describes in schizophrenic eloquence how he and a few other slaves massacred  whites in an abortive attempt to rid this country of slavery now with the rhythm of nats own account reverberating in your head try to guess answers to this question what really was behind this mans thinking or what made this coon behave so badly after all we did for him if you guess  that he had an extremely liberal master who like frankenstein created a monster by educating him and whose family treated him like one of them  that his revolutionary drive is traceable back to his sexual fantasies about the great white woman which he mistook for the divine spirit  that he was a priggish pampered and wellfed houseboy who loathed field niggers then your guesses coincide with what mr styron believes went on inside nat turner in the name of fiction mr styron can do whatever he likes with history when his interpretation however duplicates what is white americas favorite fantasy ie every black maleespecially the leaderis motivated by a latent desire to sleep with the great white woman he is obligated to explain in the structure of the novel of course this coincidental duplicationor to be criticized accordingly since there is no such explanation in the technique of the novel and since it offers no vision or new perspective but rather reaffirms an old stale shameful fantasy which is still quite saleable it is at best a good commercial novel and mr styron is certain to get movie rights out of it it has been said and i think it is true that ones enjoyment of the novel will depend in part on his view of civil_rights the book does have a strange kind of contemporaneity about it it is not for example nat turners repressed obsession for the white woman margaret whitehead that is so appallingly familar but styrons own compulsive persistence in believing that this really is nats obsession thus the novel is not so much about a black slave in a white world as it is about a contemporary white novelist engulfed in a black one it is not so much about the existential predicament of a condemned man as styron declares in the new york times oct   as it is about styrons own attempt to explain to himself the origin and destiny of the black world he sees around him every single day and in this sense  the mind of the man before us is not nat turners but william styrons someone who has not experienced or felt a thing has to have it explained to him in this i think is the key to this novel and its author as emotional inheritors to slavery few negroes need an explanation of what it was like there are some people who are not so fortunate mr styron for example tells us oct  the new york times how for many years he was haunted by the subject of slavery read also his essay this quiet dust harper april  after a number years of reading everything he could find on the subject mr styron could explain slavery to himself and to anybody who needed an explanation but he was not finished until he had created a character who could explain it all back to him his version of nat consequently is that of an extraordinarily logical explainer this version of nat turner as a rational sensitive houseboy makes it difficult to believe he could have pulled off such a gutsy revolt and styrons decision to put the story entirely in the mouth of his hero is a structural error since we never know who is doing the talking nat or styron until the contemporary cliches force us to decide in favor of styron rational sensitive and with a good grip on the american class scheme styrons nat finds the field niggers disdainful and avoids them whenever possible in using the outhouse for example he avoided the morning rush training my bowels to obey a later call when i can enjoy some privacy why is it necessary for a major white american novelist to insist upon creating a nat turner who avoids his own people could it be that styron is trying to make his character plausible and for whom white middle class america maybe in stressing the logical rational side of nat styron ignored the emotional irrational schizophrenic charismatic powers of a man who for all who knew him was a witch doctor magician shaman and prophet these powers relate nat directly to the tribal preliterate society of africa in which the leader had to prove by extraordinary feats and prophetic visions that he was indeed possessed of the sacred mana no doubt this tradition tempered nats version of christianity he was not as styron invents the grandson but the first born of a spirited african girl who was literally just off the boat in order to be known to native blacks as a witchehman one had to possess at birth both physical peculiarities like a whopplejaw a harelip crooked or bowed legs one eye like fire and the other eye dead and uncommon intelligence in his actual confession recorded at the time of his trial nat says that he was thought by his father and mother to be intended for some great purpose because of certain marks on my head and breast and of his unnatural mental peculiarity he relates this incident    when three or four years old i was telling them children with whom he was playing something which my mother overhearing said it had happened before i was borni stuck by my story however and related some things which went in her opinion to confirm itothers being called on were greatly astonished knowing that these things had happened and caused them to say in my hearing i surely would be a prophet nat convinced many others of his charismatic powers but he seemed to have been his own greatest believer this selfadmiration is best noted in his description of how he learned to read the manner in which i learned to read and write not only had great influence on my mind as i acquired it with the most perfect ease so much so that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet but to the astonishment of the family one day when a book was shown me to keep me from crying i began spelling the names of different objectsthis was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood particularly the blacks unlike john browns histrionics at his own trial nats confessions represent the real man throughout his confessions nat contemplates himself simultaneously as subject and object this schizophrenic view of oneself seems to be the natural results of a black man having to make do in a white world as leroi jones expresses it the negro could not ever become white and that was his strength at some point always he could not participate in the dominant tenor of the white mans culture yet he came to understand that culture as well as the white man it was at this juncture that he had to make use of other resources whether african subcultural or hermetic and it was this boundary this nomansland that provided the logic and beauty of his music styrons nat turner lives not in nomansland where actually he did live and black people are still living but in mr styrons white america where a white woman and a book are so symbolic of what poor nat thinks he needs that he fevers    with insupportable excitement that i can feel a loosening in by bowels really although it gives more insight into turners apocalyptic disturbed and irrational mind than any single part of styrons novel nats own account of his education quoted above styron ignores when nat in the actual confession talked of his education he was really talking about himself his feelings his grandiose ideas etc but when styron comes to describe nats education he abandons nats account of his education for his own invented version he seems to suggest that nat revolted against the slavery of his people because of his education and not because of his sense of humanity provoked by identification with that group styron therefore replaces nats account of his education with what reads like a scene from up from slavery a la mode walt disney burning with the desire to be educated this little black boy spends his free time in his masters cellar learning the labels on barrels of sugar saltpeter etc then one day he gets up a lot of nerve and steals a book quite a noble fellow he is caught but instead of being punished he is assured by his liberal master that he will certainly learn to read after all styron says part of his intent was not to shirk what must have been after all the tolerable aspects of the situation ie slavery styrons nat turner is also a victim of his creators theories of revolutionary heroes in an interview styron said nat like most revolutionaries was basically puritanical and this is the reason that in the book he nat turner never had a sexual experience directly with a woman he has an adolescent homosexual experience quite innocent beyond that turner lived a sexual life of fantasy fantasies of women mainly white women which in turn led to imagined revelations and then finally to what turner supposed were revelations from the divine spirit new york times oct  can we account for a caesar an alexander martin luther mao jefferson there is no real distinction between a born leader and a revolutionary leader it all depends on what side you are on by this theory and if not why foist it off on nat it is my guess that nat turners revolt cannot be explained by a theory it can only be felt possibly through art styrons book is too fettered by contemporary cliches to approach art he cannot begin to use his emotions because he has paralyzed them with his fantastic analytical ability to explain everything styron denies of course contemporary parallels in the book the central meaning of the book is not consciously contemporary because he began the book and was concerned with the subject back in the fortiesas though the negro problem just moved on the scene in the last  years if a novel has new information the overshadowing of the artistic and aesthetic intents by the contemporary parallels may be justified but styron has nothing new to say what he says has been said over and over and believed by far too many in his views on the negro he only differs from the infamous enemy of the negro movement the liberal in using history as a buttress for his ideas styrons nat finally is a super conformist not only does he adopt white mannerisms and parrots their linguistic rhythms but if the truth be told he wishes he were white and the reviewer who said styrons nat turner was negro only in physical aspect is right styrons nat is telling the reader constantly that he is just like any other american yet only middle class america is convinced that any black man least of all a nat turner is an american like anybody else on this point leroi jones has said the negro as he exists in america now and has always existed in this place certainly after formal slavery is a natural nonconformist being black in a society where such a state is an extreme liability is the most extreme form of nonconformity available the vantage point of being both outside and inside at the same time connects the black writer with america in a way the white writer can never be connected to his country in the writings of w e b du bois e franklin frazier james weldon johnson richard wright james baldwin ralph ellison and leroi jones we have proof of this william faulkner was very wise in believing he could never imagine himself as a negro this is not to suggest that mr styron tried to be a negro and failed what i am saying is that there is the dark side of nat turner which mr styron never shows us he shows us not a black nat but a white nat at best a colored one in a white worldcecil m brown

all right to begin with it is expensivebut it is also very rare and even more special there has never been anything quite like it made available to the general bookbuying public and it very possibly will never be made available again in this edition what is itit is ethiopian painting a collection of color reproductions and photographs of the art of ancient abyssinia from the late middle ages and during the gondar dynasty arranged by jules leroy and published by frederick a praeger in his preface to this grand volume m leroy points out that ethiopia is usually conspicuously absent from histories of art both general histories and those which are concerned specifically with african works of art any reference that does occur is very limited and bears no relation to the actual significance of the subject he says the book sets out to indicate just how significant ethiopian art has been particularly in the area of coptic christian representations the story of ethiopian painting is closely allied to that of the countrys political and religious development the author states it mirrors ethiopias various links with the outside world and the influences which these contacts have had upon her cultural development it is m leroys bias to explain ethiopias glories and her unique culture almost wholly in the light of the countrys christian history but that can easily be overlooked in reading and absorbing the capsule report on the ethiopian past which m leroy provides certainly many of the paintings shown in the book are close in style and technique to those of a contemporary period in europe but the most fascinating specimens are those stamped with that special flavor which is neither european nor african nor even suggestive of the familiar art of neighboring egypt but oriental some are strongly reminiscent of ancient chinese tapestries but it has to be accepted that they nevertheless are distinctly ethiopian m leroys text is solid intensive and instructive and it would be useful as an essay on ethiopian art and history even without the elaborate illustrations which incidentally must have been set on the pages by hand there are keys to the various plates indicating their location whether in churches or ecclesiastical buildings in ethiopia or in museums in ethiopia or in other countries and there are captions to the plates which provide a rather comprehensive rundown on the background and historical significance of the art works there also are bibliographical notes which under the circumstances the first encyclopedic references to ethiopian art were entered around the turn of the century reveal a paucity of research in this area furthermore nearly all the research material is in french german and italian and there is a general index the book was printed in italy by fantoni artegrafica venezia apparently it was first published in milan in  and the english translation is by claire pace whatever the case ethiopian painting is a singular book a proud specimen for those concerned with african art and history the costat is indeed quite high but great care and artistry
joy adamson is well known in naturalist and moviegoing circles as the white britisher who wrote so persuasively of her relationship with the lioness elsa there were three or four of the elsa books and a film based on them and elsa has as a consequence been established as one of the more gracious heroines of all animalhood mrs adamson has now tried her hand with a book on humans in the land of elsa kenya by name the book is the peoples of kenya harcourt brace  world  and it is a big book well suited for children of all ages if not of all outlooks which is not to say that it is not a remarkable book for it is even more remarkable than apparent when one realizes that nearly all the photographs and entirely all the paintings reproduced in this lavishly illustrated book are the work of mrs adamson mrs adamson set out to record on canvas the flora of kenya but she became so fascinated with its fauna human and otherwise that she decided to put some of them on canvas too the kenya government presumably under the british commissioned her to do so after she had undertaken the work on her own initiative and at her own expense the emphasis is on the various peoples of kenya as much as possible in their native state that is in the areas as removed as possible from the influences of encroachingwesternization in this mrs adamson and her book have performed a most useful service she deals knowledgeably with the different tribes of kenya and with their customs and clothing the  pages are crammed with valuable information humanized by mrs adamsons uncomplicated personalized narrative style there is an epilogue written in a more sophisticated if also more technical style by g w b huntingford an anthropologist excellent features of the book are the index and the elaborate map of kenya and neighboring countries on the inside covers of the book which locates the major tribal and ethnic groups discussed in the book there also are helpful explanatory notes and a glossary of abbreviations plus a bibliography the reader will not find in the peoples of kenya any photographs of the modern metropolis of nairobi nor any reference to the fact that kenya is the most industrialized of the newly independent countries in east africa but that is the subject of some other book hwf 
the dance through the ages madison square press  by walter sorell is one of those big handsome profusely illustrated books which appear every autumn just in case someone is thinking of the holidays and the gift problem and the dance through the ages it should be said directly will make a splendid gift for the dance buff holiday or not the text is comprehensive mr sorell begins with a consideration of primitive dancing elaborating his simple thesis that dancing is a medium of mans selfassertion an outlet for surplus energy a supreme means of expression the succeeding chapters of the plus page book ranges through such diversions as the rules of ritual folklore and theater the triumph of romanticism pioneers of modern dance martha graham graces the cover and after diaghilev there are chapters on the dances of the east the renaissance man and cancanization and there are chapters on the mass media and the dance dealing with the movies the stage musicals and television and recording the dance of very special interest to negro digest readers of course is the chapter on jazz and the negro dance which mr sorell has handled with perception and knowledge some of the most beautiful of many extraordinary photos in the book are shots of alvin ailey and his dancers against a black backdrop the dance in africa of course also is considered in the opening chapter of the book the dance through the ages is rich in illustration both photos and drawings and both color and black and white walter sorell teaches the history of the dance and theater and dramatic literature at columbia university and at the new school for social research in new york city he also is a contributing editor to dance magazinehwf i  there have been many books about south africa but ernest coles house of bondage random house  gains extra force with its expressive photographs which bring before our eyes the conditions which mr cole with thomas flaherty describes in the text after seeing photographs of a starving baby a schoolteacher exhausted after a day in an overcrowded schoolroom and ragged streetboys huddled in a park one gets a deeper feeling of the land and of the conditions the people have to endure ernest cole had to pose as a pilgrim to lourdes to escape from south africa with his photographs previously when he had been questioned by the police about them he had to pretend that he was working on a story about juvenile delinquency to prevent the police from confiscating them the photographs are excellent they range from striking portraits to action shots of tsotsis from zoot suit picking the pocket of an afrikaaner and mugging another to mood shots of the loneliness of the exiles village of frenchdale there is an introduction by joseph lelyveld who met mr cole while he was new york times correspondent in south africa in the text which precedes each section of photographs mr cole describes various aspects of south africa the mines transportation the police the locations servants apartheid bantu education hospitals religion streetboys and tsotsis shebeens and beer halls the middle class banishment education now has become education for servitude in the stricter apartheid today the state in its haste sometimes tears down the old locations to remove the blacks before it has built new towns for them and consequently they have to live in tents the best jobs are reserved for whites outside of a few doctors and awyers to serve the blacks the best that an african can hope for is to be a servant or messenger the result of this blocking of advancement is the streetboys and the adult tsotsis who live by crime and robbery since they are used to violence if there is a confrontation between whites and blacks the tsotsis would be the spearhead of violence since the middle class cannot advance they measure their status by the difference between themselves and those who are poorer or less educated they pathetically treasure tea or dinner with liberal whites and scorn to serve on committees with someone who may be a servant thus their potential leadership is often lost both the text and the photographs make conditions in south africa vivid to us but the pictures add extra values of emotion interest and aesthetics which make it a desirable purchasedudley randall
at  bull street denmark vesey stood in r front of his mirror  carefully knotting his cravat he spent a few seconds searching his beard for gray hairs then he slipped into his coat set his hat squarely on his head and picked up his bible and a package wrapped in brown paper from the top of his dresser he gazed thoughtfully at the package and then dropped it in his pocket after one last glance at his short dark frame in the mirror he went out the back door and down the dirt path toward his buggy where peter poyas waited squatting beside the horses  as he crossed the yard he heard the cannon at fort moultrie booming across the charleston harbor shaking the city out of its sunday afternoon lethargy he watched the cannon smoke billow up into the still carolina sky and catch the last copper streaks of sunlight as the sun like a huge ball of fire slipped down behind the ashley river sending long shadows creeping up the narrow twisted streets over wooden fences across wide flowered yards and into the cool frame houses of the town the horses stirred rattling their harnesses as denmark approached the buggy and peter poyas rose shifting his shoulders in his stiff sunday coat his great neck straining against his shirt collar i still dont see why you have to go through with this denmark he said handing denmark the reins if everything goes right it wont be long fore you haveem with

letting denmarks hand fall from his shoulder well denmark you go ahead if you have to i know how you feel but you remember and keep a hold on your temper you hear ill watch it ill watch it    see you tonight after church peter nodded and slapped the flank of the near horse and the buggy whirred down the lane alongside the house two deep lines creased his brow as he stood gazing at denmarks erect back then he followed lane out onto bull street wagons and buggies filled mostly with negroes dressed in their sunday finery rolled softly up and down the street as the people passed peter poyas their faces brightened evening peter evening hidee peter coming to the services tonight on my way there now sister on my way now peter started across the street where ned and rolla bennett waited in one of their masters wagons ned sat rooted in the high front seat like a black buddha patiently flicking the reins at the flies buzzing around the mules beside him slouched rolla his long legs jutting out over the wagon his eyes wandering over the passing  girls while his hands caressed the polished back of the guitar that rested in his lap when peter reached the wagon rolla quickly stood up moved behind the front seat leaned over the side and helped peter into the wagon ned clucked at the mules and they lumbered east towards kings road a carriage driven by a large black man glided past them fluttering with reds and greens and blues worn by a mulatto woman and three brown girls the driver smiled and waved his hand peter and ned smiled and waved rolla grunted there goes that ol jim pencill mista god amighty hisself just cause he free he thinks he bettern the rest of us niggers sheeit he wont even let his daughters dance with us ned said take it easy boy he only been free a few years and

in seventeen when we decided to set up our own church ned said yeah    yeah i reckin maybe you right anyway well decide tonight after church for sure they reached kings road and turned north on it they crossed calhoun street and ned urged the mules on to escape the sharp odors of the stock pens as they rolled past the old citadel rolla peered into the shadows surrounding the high gloomy walls he shivered remembering the tales of ghosts and torture and blood and rape and cocked his head to catch some whisper from the stillness they passed into open country and the darkness closed in fast the june night was clear and starless a pale yellow moon sneaked up behind their backs and glided along the tops of the trees that hustled in the shadows alongside the road from a close by pond frogs bassed out their songs nearer crickets clicked out their mes   sages up ahead they saw the lights of the african methodist episcopal church glowing in the darkness ned stuck his pipe in his mouth for one last smoke peter shifted his shoulders in his tight coat rolla stood up swaying in the middle of the wagon and began to tune his guitar hey mista peter rolla said aint ol jim pencill supposed to preach tonight uh huh well i sure hope he dont stand up there and talk all night so well have some time left for singing and dancing id druther hear mista denmark preach anytime i reckin we aint gonna have no time for singing or dancing tonight peter said i think wed better get back to denmarks house right after the preaching im a little worried about him new glanced quickly at peter and said why whats the mater peter said denmarks took it in his head again to try to buy bell and benji free from ol mista faulkner and you know as well as i do how its gonna come out yeah ned said nodding slowly he twisted around in his seat and looked at rolla i dont wanna have to come looking for you rolla and find you gallivantin out in the woods you be at the wagon right after preaching you hear      the buggy reeled down the moonfilled road and still denmark cracked the reins across the backs of the drumming horses a moan slipped out of his lips and was snatched away by the wind his head whirled his ears roared suddenly he felt his stomach heaving and he hauled back on the reins before the horses had stopped he leaped from the buggy and stumbled into a grove of pine trees at the edge of the road vomit spewed from his mouth and nose a spasm shook him his knees buckled and as he fell face forward into his own waste the sharp scent of pine and cedar rose in waves around him slowly he regained consciousness he struggled to his knees and looked around down the road he saw his horses and buggy standing quietly in the moonlight above him he heard an owl hoot and flutter its wings he crawled to a tree and leaned his back against it as his head cleared what had happened back at the faulkner house flooded back into his mind and a scream surged out of his chest cutting through the tall trees and shattering the still night    when he wheeled his buggy into the faulkner driveway he had seen bell standing in the doorway of her cabin which lay behind and to the right of the rambling unpainted main house he knew that she had been watching for him and he smiled and threw up his hand he saw her shift in the doorway and place one hand on her hip shes all of fifty he thought and still as fine a looking woman as ever ill be down directly he called aloud i gotta see mista faulkner first he saw her nod and sink down in the doorway behind her in the dim light of the cabin he thought he caught a glimpse of benji and he smiled again he drove around to the back of the main house whoaed the horses and climbed down from the buggy he patted the brown package in  his coat pocket clutched his bible under his arm and marched up to the back door as he rapped on the door peters voice flitted through his mind now you remember you aint got no right to go stirring up things    the door swung open and conroy faulkners tall wide body filled the yellow block of light denmark said evening mista faulkner i came to visit bell and benji but first id like to talk a little business with you come on in denmark faulkner said i been meaning to talk to you too come on in he retreated into the room dragged a chair from under the kitchen table and sat down crossing his legs at the ankles tufts of reddish hair streaked with gray peeped from under his widebrimmed hat that shadowed the upper part of his face the galluses of his breeches flapped down and his massive chest was bare and pale against the red brown of his neck and lower arms he clasped his hands over his stomach now ringed with fat and looked up at denmark who had followed him into the room denmark he said ive knowed you for a long timeever since i bought bell and ive alius gave you leeway to see her even more so after you got benji by her aint that right yessir and thats what i want to see you about    what im saying is that i cant have you coming to see bell and the boy no more you ruining the boy just today i had to   i    whatre you talking about denmark took a step forward look i got three thousand dollars and ill give it all to you straight out for bell and the boy he drew the brown package from his coat pocket and thrust it in faulkners face three thousand dollars and you wont have to worry about seeing me around here no more faulkner let his eyes slide away from the money cant you get it through your head that bell and benji aint for sale they mine and i dont want you round here no more you ruining the boy you    but mista faulkner didnt you promise me years ago and each year after that that i could buy bell and benji now didnt you faulkner lowered his chin on his chest and said softly yeah i did but things was different then my wife was living and conroy junior was still at home but i aint gonna sell bell and the boy to you now his voice dropped lower they all i got and you gonna have to stay away    coming round here filling the boys head with all kinds of stuff    youyou even got bell acting like she dont belong to me denmark felt the anger rising in him and the shame he pressed his bible tighter under his arm trying to still the tremors running through his body he had thought that he had grown accustomed to the shame that unique humiliation that swept over him each time he had to obtain faulkners permission to visit bell and benji but now it struck him like a hammer thoughts that he had suppressed for years rose to the surface of his mind this was not just a matter of his trying to buy two slaves but of two men wanting the same woman had peter known is that why he had said aint no amount of money gonna matter is that why faulkner had made excuses year after year suddenly he realized that he was not at all sure of bell didnt he after all have other women and children and had he failed year after year to buy her freedom he felt his heart pounding again peters words flashed across his mind you aint got no right    but he spun on his heels stepped to the door and jerked it open his voice shoving the light spilling out into the dark yard bell you come up here right now you come up here and you bring the boy listen nigger whats got into you no nigger can come on my property  cause you free  you still a nigger  denmark turned from the door and approached faulkner again holding out the money to him he saw faulkner glance at the money three thousand dollars mista faulkner he said with this money you can move into town and be near mista conroy junior denmark paused wondering why he was all at once a little concerned for this man then he continued and i tell you what ill fix up a small place for you therereal cheap aint i one of the best carpenters in town what do you want to stay out here for anyhow the lands wore out youre going deeper and deeper into debt every year he heard bell enter the room but he kept his eyes on faulkner who still sat with his chin on his chest the anger in him that had died down momentarily flared again now that bell was here hed show this man what was what what i cant understand mista faulkner is why you wont sell bell and benji free now bell already knows that you promised    faulkner jerked up his head nigger you shut up then he saw bell and his voice dropped ive said all im gonna say denmark now you get off my property denmark looked at bell she stood quietly just inside the door her hands folded across her shift her wide eyes darting from him to faulkner her bottom lip caught between her teeth he held her eyes and said but mista faulkner all im trying to do is buy two  nigger slaves for three thousand dollars now why would you a white man refuse to sell two niggers for three times what theyre worth faulkner shoved up from the chair his face livid denmark turned facing him and he could see that he was plunging past the danger point but even as peters warning was beating through his brain words were tumbling out of his mouth bells my woman mista faulkner she might be your slave but shes my woman keeping his eyes locked with faulkners he stretched out his hand toward bell and said come here bell come over here he saw faulkners mouth open and then clamp shut the silence seemed like twenty years he noticed a vein throbbing in faulkners temple and felt his own heart pounding in his throat at the edge of his vision he saw bell pressed against the wall beside the door again he motioned with his outstretched hand and said come on over here bell he saw her sway almost imperceptibly in his direction and his heart sang his happiness died before it was born he saw faulkners eyes darting around the room and the blood draining from his face you aint got no right to go stirring up things not right now just for your woman and boy he had to stop bell he tried to run his tongue over his dry lip and he felt his face cracking as he forced himself to grin he  couldnt risk everything just to satisfy himself dont look like shes gonna come mista faulkner he said must be hard of hearing aint worth no three thousand dollars nohow he saw the tenseness disappear from faulkners body well nigger im glad you came to your senses for awhile i thought i was gonna have to   he knows im lying denmark thought but he cant do nothing aloud he said hell aint no old nigger woman worth that much bother faulkner was conciliatory you gonna have to git it through your head denmark that you a nigger even though you free the next time   wont be no next time mista faulkner denmark grinned he knows im lying denmark thought but he wont do anything about it because then hes admitting to bell and to hisself that she is a woman to him and not just a slave but what is bell thinking he looked at her she wouldnt meet his eyes her shoulders seemed to droop he clenched his bible and screamed silently you awful lucky i like you denmark you a good hard working nigger most of the time but i cant have you round bell and the boy no more his tone changed now you git on home and consider yourself lucky yessir mista faulkner denmark grinned i sure will he felt the room swaying but he kept the smile on his face he looked again at bell her eyes were still on the floor his bell of over twenty years bell with the strong thighs and tender hands bell who nodded and understood even urged him when he alone bought his freedom and left her with only promises you aint got no right to go stirring up things  i got to get out of here he thought i got to get out of here he began to move backwards toward the door the grin still pasted on his face    and the next time i catch you on my property ill put the law on you or shoot you and you stay away from that boy    you the cause i had to whip him today anyhow    that boy got to learn  denmark thought i got to get out of here before i kill him right now before i kill him right now before i kill him right now still moving backwards he stumbled out of the back door dropping his bible and as he regained his footing he saw benji standing in the darkness silently his eyes glowing like two moons had he heard benji he took a step toward him but benji shrinked ? along the wall and slipped through the doorway benji benji the loner the swift who ran all day through the woods and fields who wasnt yet broken to the harness the promises  he started for the door you aint got no right    not right now he stopped the air rushed out of his lungs perspiration stung his eyes he saw the block of light in the doorway waver and begin to spin and he turned and fled he scrambled into the buggy and fumbled for the reins as he wheeled his buggy around he spotted his bible the pages fluttering laying in the path of light streaming out into the yard he slapped the reins across the horses backs sending them bolting down the driveway    now he staggered to his feet made his way out of the grove of pines to the road and headed for his horses and buggy that still stood quietly in the moonlight down the road pulling his handkerchief from his pocket he began to wipe the vomit from his clothes his body still shook and his knees were weak he paused to catch his breath then started again ill wait no longer he said aloud ill die if i wait any longer the sound of his own voice stilled his trembling and strengthened his legs  he  the prayer ended jim pencill rose from his knees and stepped up to the pulpit as the congregation shuffled and scraped and settled back on the benches he thumbed the pages of his bible finding his place he held it with his finger and looked out over the sea of black faces brothers and sisters he said tonight im going to take my text  from the book of exodus the twentysecond twentythird and twentyfourth verses he looked down at his finger and read haltingly and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up to god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them jim pencill paused to let his words sink in then he laced his fingers together rested his elbows on his bible and said brothers and sisters i want you to pay real close attention to these holy verses and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt diedin the process of time  rolla shifted in his seat he crossed and uncrossed his legs folded and unfolded his arms then he glanced down the bench at ned and peter ned sat with his eyes closed his hands folded across his stomach rolla didnt see neds lips move at all and barely heard the angry murmur i dont aim to die a slave in the process of time    and after hearing their cries and moans god had respect for the children of israelrespect because they kept his commandments even while in bondage    rolla saw peters composed face slowly turn toward him and their eyes met catching the tiny light in peters eyes he smothered the smile forming in his lips he wasnt sure if the flash had been of laughter or of anger then his eyes dropped to peters lap and when he saw the clenched fists he knew    and in time god delivered the children of israel out of their bondage in the process of time god   rolla crossed his legs again his guitar in his lap and let his eyes roam over the crowd of black faces hoping to catch the eye of some pretty girl
