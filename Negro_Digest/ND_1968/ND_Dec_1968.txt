ruchard wrights t revealing statement concerning the literam ture that he wrote had little to do with literature at all in his autobiography black boy wright recorded  there are some elusive profound recondite things that men find hard to say to other men but with the negro it is the little things of life that become hard to say for these tiny items shape his destiny a man will seek to express his relations to the stars but when a mans consciousness has been riveted upon obtaining a loaf of bread that loaf of bread is as important as the stars metaphorically speaking the choice was one between the abstract and the pragmatic between a literature which did not in the words of critic stanley braithwaite hover over the race question but instead owed its highest allegiance to poetry and a realistic art which dealt with the fundamental problem of being negro in americaart which refused to either ignore or subsume the problem through adherence to critical standards acceptable to the american academic community having made his choice richard wright refused to compromise believing always that words were weapons he dared to probe levels of experience which more timid writers bypassed like goethes faust he was obsessed by an insatiable desire to delve into the pits of darkness and despair in an attempt to reveal the inferno of human discontent fear hatred and violence which is the most telling characteristic of twentieth century man having himself undergone experiences which can only be called kafkaesque in their grotesqueness like coleridges ancient mariner he was ravished with a passion to tell his story to inform the naive of the malady of terror with which everyman trapped in a brutal oppressive environment is inflicted for this reason his earliest fiction was naturalistic and there was certainly a great deal of truth in his admonition that all my life had shaped me for the realism the naturalism of the modern novel    yet neither his writings nor his experiences can be so narrowly categorized the negro writes saunders redding lives on two planes of awareness which is close to saying that the negros experiences are likely to be at one and the same time both realistic and existential to be sure the negro lives in a society in which his outlook upon life his personality and his psychological makeup are predetermined to a great degree howeve r  each negro despite the disclaimers envisions a coming gotierdamerung when like the existential hero he undertakes the establishment of his own identity by destroving in total the oppressive restrictive societal apparatus which he secretly loathes it is not true therefore as ralph ellison among others has intimated that wright was stifled and restricted by the form of the naturalistic novel for in the lieht of  whis myriad experiences wright could not completely adhere to the naturalistic formula despite his indebtedness to emile zola the father of the naturalistic novel or to theodore dreiser whose sister carrie had a tremendous effect upon him unlike his counterparts for wright there was always the insurmountable barrier of color which constituted a wedge of such fortitude between reality and illusion as to produce a fiction vastly different from that of other naturalistic adherents but insofar as a black writer could be true to any formula wright was true to the naturalistic code yet he never forgot his earlier injunction that a loaf of bread is as important as the stars his literature therefore would always contain a schizophrenic quality wavering as did the lives of those whom he wrote about between pragmatism and transcendence he never lost sight of the pull of those tremendous forces upon the individual yet he took cognizance of the individuals obsession to crush those forces he never ceased to marvel at how smoothly the black boys acted out the roles that the race had mapped out for them most of them were not conscious of living a special separate stunted way of life yet  in some period of their growinga period they had no doubt forgottenthere had been developed in them a delicate sensitive controlling mechanism that shut off their minds and emotions from all that the white race said was taboo yet he knew and perhaps he was his own best example that the personality had not been totally destroyed that all emotions had not  been channeled into a predetermined direction that the social institutions had not completely transformed  million people into nonthinking nonsensitive nonfeeling robots and never mind that men wore masks never mind that men refused to articulate the truth never mind that men practiced the art of mimeticsand american negroes have made a profession of the artthe atmosphere of hatred and fear which created bigger thomas is still present in modern day america goading and pushing each negro across the nihilistic brink where in one transcendent moment he is lifted above his predetermined state gaining a sense of manhood identity and social worth through the only means possible in an oppressive societythe medium of violence this is the reality of bigger thomas ignored by white and black critics alike there can however be no doubt of biggers transcendence in book one of native son bigger thomas is indeed the mechanical robot the prototype of the naturalistic character he had the feeling that the robbing of blums would be a violation of ultimate taboo it would be a trespassing into territory where the full wrath of an alien white world would be turned loose upon him it would be a symbolic challenge of the white worlds rule over him a challenge which he yearned to make but was afraid the bigger thomas of book two however transcends this fear this section is appropriately labelled flightfor it signifies not only biggers flight from the law but also his flight from the frightened unsure boy of book one to whom white folks formed a kind of superworld the thought of what he had done wright elaborates after bigger murders mary dalton the awful horror of it the daring associated with such actions formed for him for the first time in his fearridden life a barrier of protection between him and a world he feared he had murdered and created a new life for himself americans wright was to record much laterreferring to native sonhave not been able to accept my vision which is not completely trueamericans were capable of accepting the vision in part critics admit to the sanctity of the sociological argument agree that the institutions of the american society have been repressive in regard to its black minority indeed few would disagree with the indictment of the american social svstem leveled by biggers lawyer max that part of the vision which americans have not been able to acceptdespite the recent yearly insurrections in the ghettosis a nation of bigger thomases for whom no hope can be found for whom no peace can come for whom no transcendence is possible save through the flaming armageddon of violent revolution but on another level as james baldwin has pointed out americans have little to fear from bigger thomas the underlying thesis of native son offers hope to the american society if that society will come to the unmistakable conclusion that men live despicable lives of continuous desperation and undertake those programs which by resurrecting bigger thomas will grant salvation to the nation as a whole it is on this level baldwins critique to the contrary that bigger thomas serves as the christ figure the martyr to the hopes of desperate men everywhere the catalytic agent by which a society can be redeemed but hope writes matthew arnold once crushed is less quick to spring anew and the bigger thomas of the s is the embryo of the bigger thomas of the s and s this is not to maintain as wright has been accused of doing that blacks have not made progress in the american society since the s but rather to suggest that progress must be measured not in terms of civil_rights material wealth or governmental appointments but instead in terms of level of consciousness and the awareness by black people of those tremendous forces of which bigger could only conjecturea realization that the human spirit must be free unrestricted by either demagogic men or demagogic institutions wright was among the first to recognize such progress and to create a character who serves as a footnote to black men today those for whom all hope has been dissipated all optimism subsumed under the weight of constant rejection men who see salvation not in terms of resurrecting the society but in dismantling it in toto to produce a social order in which each individual will be the architect of his own destiny the outsider written  years after native son is the archetype of the new spiritthe first black character in american fiction to dare all in an existential attempt to stave off personal dehumanization in damon the bridge from bigger thomas to nihilistic man is traversed for by the nature of things such a man sooner or later was bound to appear modem man sleeps in the myths of the greeks and jews those myths are now dying in his head and in his heart they can no longer serve him when they are really gone those myths man returns    and whats to guide him nothing at all but his own desires which would be his only values such a vision was totally rejected by americans both black and white a nation of men clutching a dream which has long since become a nightmare for most of its citizens a nation whose people are daily tranquilized by the rhetoric of its leaders portraying a land of freedom promise and opportunity while one tenth of its population knows only misery despair and  frustrationis it any wonder that such a nation would be incapable of accepting the existence of a character for whom the society is so degenerate as to produce a savage obsession to destroy everything that society has constructed even wright himself was ambivalent towards this vision he could not accept cross damon as readily as he accepted bigger thomas for it is damon not bigger who is the real monster that aberration as one unkind critic has remarked upon humankind bigger blunders into murder cross skillfully executes it biggers motives are guided by urges beyond his control damons are premeditated each step well calculated bigger desired to create a new identity cross desired no less than to create a new world bigger wants to share in the protestant ethic cross will settle only for an ethic devised by himself bigger is the disgruntled reformer cross is closer to being a nihilist in the camus sense than any character in american fiction a nihilist is not one who believes in nothing writes albert camus he simply does not believe in what exists at the moment and wrights creation but not wright himself could adhere to this philosophy wright believed wholeheartedly in the ethics and values which damon  theoretically at leastwanted to destroy and thus wrights most complex character got out of hand refusing to allow his master to resurrect him even at the end of the novel damon remains the prophetic portrait of modernday black men who are putting forth the most nihilistic of questionswhether a nation which continues to physically and mentally murder and maim onetenth of its people has any valid reason for existing wright himself had asked a similar question before in the short story bright and morning star aunt sue is forced to choose between saving her life and that of her son or protecting the movement which is to eventually usher in the new jerusalem over the dying corpse of the old her hatred of the old system is so intense that she chooses in favor of the movement despite the tenuous position upon which the movement rests wright never made such a choice despite periods of overwhelming doubt he remained wedded to the theoretical concepts of western democracy despite his brief excursion into the communist party despite his selfimposed exile he remained convincedas he argued in black_powerthat the survival of western civilization rested upon the coexistence and corecognition of multicultures in which the sanctity of all would be inviolate his vision though often varied remained true to the theme of his earlier writings he saw the possibility of transcendence in the bigger thomases of the nation and he warned america that a nation incapable of putting its ideals into practice would produce cross damons seeking their manhood through a nihilistic attempt to negate the very structure of democracy itself he reaffirmed this thesis in white man listen projecting his vision onto the world arena here he admonished the world powers east and west that at present the wretched of the earth could transcend their conditions only through violence and if this remained the price that men would have to pay for individual freedom then pay it they would this was wrights final message to white men and in light of the turbulence of the past years the message is perhaps already outdated for wright is the last black writer to admonish men to listen today the representatives of that third force which frantz fanon envisioned as moving beyond existentialism to create a world order out of many varied identities no longer seek to communicate with those who continue the oppression begun by their ancestors each day the lines of communication between black man and white man in particular and man and man in general drift wider apart and perhaps the telling mark of the twentieth century is the inability of one man to communicate with another this wright would not have liked he believed always in the community of man and he realized that complete dedication to nihilism would make impossible the building of such a community true then to his basic idealsto those ethics and values hewn out of the violence and terror of those most darkest of southern nights he would still believe even at the time of his death with andre malraux that every man is a mad man but what is a human destiny for if not to unite the mad man with the universe
richard wright  and i were sitting in a  bedroom of the zephyr on the way to nashville tennessee we had for us luxurious accommor dations and we were both enjoying the comfort of the double compartment we had taken off our jackets donned slippers and called the porter for ice and soda to mix drinks it was april in  and we had just left chicago on the way to fisk university where dick was to speak to the students and faculty and i was to address the sociology department charles s johnson head of the sociology department had invited us and we traveled in style for the university was paying our expenses dick had been staying with me in chicago for a week filled with parties dinners and meeting people from the university of chicago and members of the institute for psychoanalysis we were both tired and the privacy and comfort of our accommodations suited our mood we sat facing each other before the broad picture window in this deluxe surrounding our drinks on a small table between us the train speeding along wheels clacking a rhythm under us the scenery swirling past in a blur the hoarse mooo of the zephyrs horn swept back over us like drawnout notes of a trombone caught up the clang of bells to warn of a railroad crossing standing in the dust just off the rightofway was an old bentover black man leaning on his cane this zephyr went so fast it swirled papers and stuff into a small tornado whipped his overcoat over his bony frame and rocked him about as we hurtled on down the tracks dick said that old man tell you what hes thinking these white people millions and millions go by and blow smoke and dust in this old mans face and i can hardly get home to cook my grits and beans and side pork they go on and on and i wonder where my family has gone up north someplace but not on that train he could enter the mind of this old man identify with affection and joy but as an artist he could not make such identification or empathize with a white person  we were silent awhile the incident enhanced our mood were over the border now dick said were over the old masondixon line in these days crossing the line was a matter of consequence for here formal jim crow came into force nashville isnt too bad for the south i said fisk is an oasis once were on the campus well its okay dinner chimes sounded in the corridor lets eat in the room i suggested i dont feel like putting on shoes and a tie and i dont feel like looking into the faces of a lot of redfaced peckerwoods dick said a solicitous waiter served us excellent steaks and we went to bed earlv the next morning we got up rested both in a good mood i was in the small bathroom shaving what time do we get into nashville dick asked about eleventhirty how about breakfast i can ring for the waiter i thought what the hell weve got a hard day ahead of us but i knew dick would goad me into going to the diner i knew he would persist driven to a new experience in jim crow living which he knew would humiliate and infuriate him how do they segregate you down here i really dont know on this particular train they pull a curtain or something i honestly dont know for sure lets go try it i slammed the razor stuff into the small cabinet and stepped into the compartment look weve got this bedroom lets call a waiter god i dont need to go through everything to know how it feels but he goaded me because he had driven himself to experience this thing i didnt want to weasel out to be a coward and besides i was curious too i took my jacket from the hanger okay lets go we had to walk through three cars down narrow passageways bumping into other passengers the train rocking over its uneven roadbed we came to the diner at the kitchen and pantry end and stood waiting in line to be seated the white steward moved from one end of the car to the other seating people as they came in he glanced at us two two i said other people crowded behind us the steward looked over our shoulders and said three onefour he seated these people right away then others and in the meantime i knew we were going to be seated in one or the other of the end tables nearest the pantry the pantry where the waiters set up their trays call thjr orders fill their water pitchers and coffee pots didnt i know how many times had i as a waiter crowded into that hot little space these tables are the most undesirable in in the dining car the jim crow section i recognized as the four and the deuce tables nearest the pantry they were occupied by whites we waited the people at the four soon finished our waiter rushed up to stack the dishes he was short stout darkbrown sweat was popping out in beads on his lined face i poked dick and said were getting special attention you know that i laughed but inside me i spilled obscenities in every language i knew against these whites i heard my voice crack as i said see theyre getting our table ready for us you know dick were really special he lit a cigarette ran his eyes the length of the diner with a detached clinical look like a surgeon preparing to remove the guts of a dying man nobody will be seated at that four its killed i told dick you see the regulations are strict evervthing according to rule nothing crude theyve got a standard i know this station the waiter has certain duties look at him build up steam poor bastard he doesnt want to lose money from his white passengers on his station but he doesnt want to lose money on us either he wants to serve us but hes caught up in the whole goddamned system and must play his role the waiter began to clear the four then the deuce was empty the steward said just a minute sir getting to you aside he whispered to the harassed waiter clear the deuce not knowing i understood the lingo the waiter snarled im going as fast as i can youre putting me up a tree he picked up a tray of dirty dishes and muttered dont put me up a tree returning from the pantry the waiter whipped our table into shape tossed the clean cloth on the table laid down the gleaming silver the whole setup the steward with visible relief seated us dick slipped into the chair against the wall facing the whole dining car and i was seated opposite him it was magic as i sat down the steward slipped behind me as though to pull out my seat to give me splendid service and with one smooth movement of his arm slid the curtain behind me right to the edge of our table magic with the grace of a ballet dancer the steward moved across to the four straightened the one rose in the slender vase and with the same economy of movement reached up and swished the curtain across the back of that table that table was dead they could not fill it there were not that many negroes on the train this waiters tips would suffer he was getting it in the neck along with us i didnt know what to tip him no use to ask dickhe wouldnt know or care the steward gave us our mealchecks menus a polite smile bow  and left the waiter served us well when we had finished eating the steward came to total our checks he spoke to the waiter and now that the pressure was gone the black mans voice his demeanor his entire personalityhad gone through a metamorphosis as we lingered over coffee dick said did you notice that waiter when he talked to the steward yeah sure poor black devil his voice went up two octaves and his testicles must have jumped two inches into his stomach yes i guess so dick persisted he does that to emasculate himself to make himself more feminine less masculine more acceptable to a white man it was so obvious so shockingly true and so graphically stated that i laughed oh hell dont probe his guts youre right but youre spoiling my breakfast i complained a four days later we boarded the train looking forward to the ease  of a compartment for it had been a frantic and hectic time at fisk and we were exhausted we thought we had a bedroom but dis w covered a mixup in our reservations we complained vigorously but had to settle for an upper and lower berth we flipped and dick won so i climbed to the upper berth in the middle of the night i got up to go to the john and as i climbed down the ladder i noticed a light through the curtain dick was lying on the bed fully clothed except for his jacket reading a book what the hell arent you going to sleep i inquired when im below the masondixon line i want more between me and white people than a curtain i want iron and steel richard wright was a decisive incisive powerful intellectual giant a prophetic writer he is being rediscovered for wright dealt with the major issues and questions of all timeswith the deep meaning of mans existence with the nature of the feelings thoughts and emotions of oppressed people with mans inhumanity to man the cast of wrights characters were black but the plot is eternal
was life simply fever feeling without knowing seeking without  finding  he grew thin and his eyes held the red blood of his body   after this anguished question felt by bigger thomas and this vivid expression of the failure and turning inward of his sensory yearnings native son closes with an interchange between the condemned man and his lawyer max that has never been completely analyzed a close comparison with albert camus existentialist novelette the strangerincluding such related images as droning and stuttering such related characters as camus priest and wrights preacher and such related themes as knowledgethroughdeath and the artificiality of all courtroom trialswould advance the critical establishment toward a professionally full understanding of book three especially native son has had many admirers for thoroughly defensible reasons its racial passion and sociological and psychological richness so complement wrights other signal achievementsblack boy and uncle toms children among othersthat none of a succeeding generation of black novelists has been able to replace him in the esteem of his fellow writers the excellence of wrights work however still needs to be minutely analyzed the phrase protest literature no matter what adjectives surround it reveals almost nothing of the permanent virtues of native sonalthough those virtues are profoundly anchored in blackness in racial oppression and in the militant spirit of the author native son is a novel of remarkable agony individualized in bigger thomas yet universalized in ways grievously recognizable over a quarter of a century later on almost every page by negro readers especially the question of how the author transmitted such power and truth should have been perfectly answered by now to observe that wright suffered keenly from racism and wrote feelingly about his experiences is merely to repeat what might equally be said of many black writers wrights racial fire is widely known and it has long warmed a race in need of strong voices the still challenging question however is literary by what verbal techniques did the author help bigger thomas make the reader peep through his knothole in the fence and understand his feelings about his existence bigger did not want to die without being understood by somebody and richard wright has bequeathed one large means of understanding each bigger thomas among us the very thing that bigger hungered for after his capture that vast configuration of images and symbols whose magic and power could lift him up and make him live so intensely that the dread of being black and unequal would be forgotten     it is more than aestheticism that argues the value of images and symbols in biggers life largely existential in his perceptions bigger knows himself and his environment most surely through images when despairing he sees his life as an obscene joke happening amid a colossal din of siren screams and white faces and circling lances of light under a cold and silken sky   when bigger is walking with bessie his mind could feel the soft swing of her body  a young man consumed always with a body hunger  sensitive bigger is vulnerable even to a ray of sunshine in his cell near the end of the novel a shaft of yellow sun cut across his chest with as much weight as a beam forged of lead with a convulsive gasp he bent forward and shut his eyes  he yearns for wholeness of experiencemade possible only when his feelings merge with some equivalent object around hima yearning graphically portrayed when lying on his cot in jail biggers hands were groping fumblingly through the city of men for something to match the feelings smoldering in him    viewed internally as a conflict of forces he is physically a centrally expanding impulse always throbbing but seldom countered by anything outside of him to meet it and explain it  the symbolic cast of biggers mind is often made clear for example while he hides in an empty building a chunk of bread in his pocket and his gun nestled under his shirt against his chest are described as symbolic of his rejection of folk religion biggers tragedy his abortive sense of power a power born of a latent capacity to live  is made palpable to the reader primarily through the sharing of his many images charged with terror  native son then enables the reader to live with a black man of feeling in the truest sense of the phrase a young american whose specific ambition is to merge himself with others and be a part of this world to lose himself in it so he could find himself to be allowed a chance to live like others even though he was black  the constant frustration of that simple ambition and of the feelings supporting it is the psychological substance of the novel the network of images that most authentically attend that daily frustrationand their personal racial and national  significanceis the jamesian stuff of consciousness to be conveyed a few miscellaneous techniques serving that end might be briefly mentioned images of light and dark as expected recur frequently without special emphasis the light in the dalton house is hardly ever ratural it is a bright flood in the kitchen a room important in racial history is dim elsewhere in the home and is hallucinatory and glaring in the semihuman furnace images of snow often suggest biggers complex connectionsincluding aesthetic oneswith the white world when he leaps from the daltons window after the discovery of marys bones for example the shock of his fall went through him up his back to his head and he lay buried in a cold pile of snow dazed snow was in his mouth eyes ears snow was seeping down his back  a related type of imagery temperature contrasts such as biggers despairing wonder about the warm red blood here and cold blue sky there  marks the protagonists awareness of paradox in his surroundings natural images of those surroundings used for the sake of sensory appeal unrelated to biggers mood of the moment occur fewer than five times in the whole novel other images of nature are even more rarely thematic and the exception is interesting after bessies murder bigger lifted her feeling the wind screaming a protest against him  finally what might be called intestinal imagery is skillfully used the repeated image of marys severed head urgent in biggers feelings rather than merely sensational on the page catches fully the ambivalence and sensory horror that drive him similarly effective are pictures of the demonic furnace with its muffled breathing of the fire  the furnace emphatically described about  times stands in the middle range of key images found in native son that almost living demandingtobefed gorge whispers and sucks in its air as bigger sucks in air during his many moments of fearful tension and no air can get through the furnace  while bigger stands breathless before the imminent discovery of marys bones her earring and the hatchet blade the full identification of the furnace activities with biggers own bodily sensations was incipient earlier when he neared collapse after sticking his ransom note under the daltons door a wave of numbness spread fanwise from his stomach over his entire body    making his mouth gap  here the furnace mouth that bigger has often peeked anxiously into becomes his own mouth and the fanshaped grate of glowing coals becomes his burning stomach later as the incredulous newsman pokes at the bones in the furnace ashes bigger himself was a huge furnace now through which no air could go and the fear that surged into his stomach    was like the fumes of smoke that had belched from the ash bin  and as bigger runs from the house the inside of his stomach glowed whitehot  the identification persists as bigger notices newspaper headlines while walking to bessies room resenting the failure of newsmen to take any interest in his storymeaning his very lifeas long as it had remained buried and burning in his own heart  a rather peculiar image reminiscent of its striking usage by chekhov in ward no  occurs slightly more often than that of the furnace the picture of an excited bigger standing in the middle of the floor he leaps to this position at bessies when he wonders if he can trust her  and when he wonders if the police are questioning his family at that very moment  he takes the same stance in his own room when he discovers that he has forgotten to burn his incriminating gloves pencil and paper  and he moves to the center of his jail cell when he is excited about the revelations of his first long talk with his lawyer max  and again minutes later when he first tries to see himself in relation to other men  the meaning of these postures is specified when bigger fearfully embarrassed by the addition of his servile family and friends to the ranks of staring white people the whole cast of the novel already standing in his cell was so tense in body and mind that when the door swung in he bounded up and stood in the middle of the room  this peculiar image then pictorially frames some of biggers moments of maximum tension and freezes him at the point of maximum flight within areas that restrict his movement or thought daily trapped in corners and pockets on chicagos south side at crucial instants bigger needs spaceat least that semblance of it represented by equidistance and centrality a subtler geometric pattern comparable to effects achieved by nathaniel hawthorne in the marble faun emerges when bigger appears at the center of another figure the christian cross at the inquest with one policeman on each side of him and with two in front and two behind totaling six and therefore matching the number of jurors bigger moves ironically at the center of a cross afterwards speeding through the streets toward the dalton home for a bullying interrogation bigger rides with one officer seated on each side of him and with six police cars in front and a similar string behind carried thus is the middle of an elongated crucifix realistically adjusted to the spatial restrictions of traffic while bigger is resisting in the dalton home the imposition of a false charge of rape he confuses a cross being burned atop a building on the  other side of the street with the cross recently hung around his neck by his mothers minister reverend hammond thinking that a holy cross should not be burned but hearing outside the cries burn im and kill im bigger suddenly knows that he is not looking at the cross of christ but the cross of the ku klux klan he had a cross of salvation round his throat and they were burning one to tell him that they hated him  just as his body had metaphorically become the furnace it becomes the cross when a jailer attributes his rebellion against the religious symbol to communist dogma  thats a goddamn lie bigger shouted his body seemed a flaming cross as words boiled hysterically out of him  after bigger throws his cross awav three times the au  w thors condensed metaphor shows the meaning of these several pages in book three bigger reflects that the cross the preacher had hung round his throat had been burned in front of his eyes  wright takes pains with less noticeable images such is the case with his depiction of eyes as emblems of blindness and guilt exclusive of his many pictures of the blind mrs dalton strangely liberated by his accidental murder of mary bigger thinks about nearby people waiting for street cars
he did not look at them they were simply blind people blind like his mother his brother his sister peggy britten jan mr dalton and the sightless mrs dalton and the quiet empty houses with their black gaping windows  those blind houses in the ghetto according to biggers feelings have stares like that of the daltons white cat that leaped upon his shoulder in front of photographers in the basement when marys bones were discovered its big round black eyes twin pools of secret guilt  and like that of the murdered bessie staring at him with those round large black eyes her bloody mouth open in awe and wonder and pain    to a person like bigger his life reduced to occasional sensory joys snuffed out by a constant overbalance of pain images of the corruption of the eyehis only receptor of magnitudewould disturbingly crowd his mind two kinds of images are thematically as well as numerically impressive in native son each found in various passages between fifteen and twenty times the type discernible slightly less often the blotout image shares the powers of physical violence upon its initial appearance the day bigger first comes to  drexel boulevard and wants to wave his hand and blot out mr dalton for making him feel embarrassed or failing in that to blot himself out  using the same or quite similar words bigger wants to blot out a number of people and things before the novel ends this list of people includes negroes because they never act in unity catching the i mind and body in certainty and faith  whites because they are measuring every inch of his weakness  and all the people at the inquest because they look at and cause him to look at bessies corpse but biggers destructive impulse as made known through this kind of image is usually aimed elsewhere it is aimed for example at inactivity planning the ransom note he does not need to dance and sing and clown over the floor in order to blot out a day and night of doing nothing  it is aimed at sound blotted out by the roaring noise in his ears for instance when he hates britten so hard and hot for being a bigot  at fear blotted out by his sudden confidence when he eats breakfast with his family and thinks of how blind they were  and at death itself a different and bigger adversary than the white mountain of vengeful society  in a reversal of this variety of imagery white society itself becomes an arbitrary agent of the blottingout impulse surrounding bigger for it feels that nothing short of a quick blotting out of his life would make the city safe again  all of society colludes in such destruction points out max your honor injustice blots out one form of life but another grows up in it place with its own rights needs and aspirations  max himself however his hat jammed on his head in that subtle last scene of the novel  has in effect blotted out of his head all the words from bigger that he did not want to hear those expressions of the black prisoners superior humanity that outdistanced communist dogma the other kind of image thematic in native son with about equal frequency is the white blur and its variant forms biggers certainty of the color and his uncertainty regarding the substance of these sense impressions invest them with a degree of pathos and irony blind mrs dalton always dressed in white both a victim and an object of faulty external perception is typically a white blur    standing by the door silent ghostlike  other people pictorially share her color and meaning while bigger stands bewildered by his discovery that he has killed mary a vast city of white people blurs the reality of the room  while viewing his picture in the newspaper in which the white cat perches accusingly on his shoulder bigger feels that the whole vague white world    would track him down     and while he is being cruelly dragged and cursed and stamped in the snow he dimly sees around him an array of faces white and looming  an implicit image of the white blur and a source of monumental frustration in bigger thomas and in many of his progenyis voiced by max who tells the judge that the prisoner had no notion before he murdered and he has none now of having been wronged by any spe cific individuals  material objects in the white world also appear as blurs the reader slowly realizes that the whiteowned cars that whirred over the smooth black asphalt  shot past them at high speed  and zoomed past on swift rubber tires  early in the novel have been varicolored forerunners of the white blur when images like the white flash of a dozen silver bulbs  occur the mass image of the newsmen in the basement has a manifold significance a reversal like that observed in the blotout images appears in the use of the white blur states attorney buckley himself part of the white blur urges the death penalty to enable whites to sleep in peace tonight to know that tomorrow will not bring the black shadow of death over the homes and lives  the sentence of death brings another reversal a counter image to biggers perception as he understands every word while reacting only to the judges white face his eyes not blinking  the blur now disappears from the language of the novel clarified by its own revealed deadlinessto recur implicitly and indirectly only once transformed into a new adversary for bigger the opaqueness in the mind of max that blurs his deeper awareness of his client  by far the most numerous and the most meaningful wrights closely related images of the wall and the curtain widely distributed in over fifty separate passages in native son deserve a closer study than is possible here but their categories thirteen in number at least can be indicated when ranked according to frequency of usage the wallcurtain as a shield of indifference and detachment emphasized in eleven different passages is predominant on the first morning of the novel bigger has lurked behind his curtain of indifference    snapping and glaring at whatever had tried to make him come out into the open  several such images cluster on the pages describing biggers capture where the reader sees him trapped on the icy water tank going behind his curtain his wall looking out with sullen stares of contempt  behind his curtain now looking down at himself freezing under the impact of water in subzero winds  and when his fingers are too stiff to pick up his gun something laughed in him cold and hard he was laughing at himself  the final such image in the novel is especially interesting biggers eyes were wide and unseeing his voice rushed on  as he explains to max important things about his life and recent actions that max really does not want to hear bigger is walling max out of his perceptions so that he bigger can better gauge with his feelings whether his own tone is carrying his meaning it had been maxs tone in court not his words that had made him believe that max knew how he felt  a category of wallcurtain images used somewhat less often and used negatively is one reflecting or the artificial separation of certain classes of people bigger for classes of people bigger for example rides in the front seat of the dalton car between two vast white looming walls mary and jan  the suggestion of protectiveness in this kind of image disappears from the novel after white but honest jan has approached bigger flung aside the curtain and walked into the room of his life a passage important also for its metaphor showing biggers life as a room and therefore enhancing the meaning of every wallcurtain image thus reversed the image later pictures bigger trying to break down walls to reach other people one of the most gratifying passages in the novel employs such an image when the prisoner wonders whether if his hands were electric wires and his heart a battery and if he reached out through these stone walls and felt other hands    would there be a reply a shock not that he wanted those hearts to turn their warmth to him    but just to know that they were there and warm    and in that touch response of recognition there would be union identity  a wholeness which had been denied him all his life  similarly moved by his new insight bigger wonder how he can break down this wall of isolation between him and max whom he now sees upon another planet far off in space  and he apprehensively tells max that maybe the wall between him and other men will still be there when he is executed ill be feeling and thinking that they didnt see me and i didnt see them an early expression of ralph ellisons invisible man theme the remaining  subdivisions of the wallcurtain image spread throughout approximately  passages need not be illustrated by more excerpts to document the variety and authenticity in this area of wrights style nevertheless the following list of the subdivisions ranked again according to their frequency of use should be informative the other figurative walls and curtains then vividly represent  the suppression of certain feelings  hatred resentment and mistrust  the stunting or perversions of intelligence and imagination  the withering of familial and friendly affection  the ineffectiveness of certain barriers  the deprivation of fundamental human needs  natural barriers  entrapment  deceit  defensive counterfeelings and  the acceptance of certain isolation a knowledge of all the images in native son does not produce automatically a knowledge of bigger thomas and bigger himself feels more than he thinks concluding at last existentially that his feelings are the surest guide to truth and to morality but when i think of why all the killing was he says apparently including all the fancied killings of his life i begin to feel what i wanted what i am  to know what and why a man desires and to know what he is is the deepest human engagement of our faculties the furnace the trembling poise in the middle of the room the crucifix the haunting blind eyes the wish to blot out the white blur of the hater and avenger and the looming wall so massively effective and yet so useless and wrongall these images metaphorically dramatize part of the black mans american experience and native son preserves them for us to feel and to believe
perhaps not knowing wright makes it possible for me to evaluate  his works objectively certainly we know of his influence on baldwin george lamming and others ralph ellison is not the least of these one has only to compare ellisons invisible man the start of it to wrights short story the man who lived underground it has been reported more than once that ellison admitted his debt to wright this has always been reported secondhand ellison himself to my knowledge has never done it in public i found pagan spain to be one of wrights most perceptive books and frequent travelers to spain would do well to read it if it can be found wright had no particular stake in spain except as a human being interested in the plight of other human beings this marked a very special growth i think and it is the kind of growth all black writers must move towardfrom the burning consideration of the black oppressed to the final consideration of all oppressed peoples in the final analysis it is this consideration that makes wright the most important black writer american of all times it is after all amusing to reread wright and to find that he has said so succinctly if not always quite correctly but with the awesome power he employed what so many of us are trying clumsily to say today it really makes you want to quit trying he has said it all so well who among the current crop have been so bold as to explore the ramifications of racism in america europe africa and asia no one there is one final consideration now that wright is dead how we line up to celebrate his gifts now that he offers us no competition how wonderful he was we say the prejudice and discrimination in publishing makes us jealous of the tiny and very dispensable positions we hold in it only we can change that and i suggest that in memory of richard wright we cease scuffling amongst ourselves to attain what in the end is illusory anyway to the very end of his days as great as he was wright was pressed for bread demeaningly pressed for it if things go on as they are the end will be the same for each and every one of us lets change them lets salute next time the living like chester himes before he goes without our best wishes admiration and a medal with a field of collard greens rampant and chitlins diagonal for having written the good fight
if others care to assume my mental stance and through empathy duplicate the atmosphere in which i speak wrote p richard wright in one of his last books white man listen cfd gm  they can imaginatively grasp the factors in my environment and a sense of the impulses motivating me they will if they are of a mind be able to see more or less what ive seen will be capable of apprehending the same general aspects and tones of reality that comprise my world   part of the reality that comprised his world at the time the words were written was the experience of some thirty years in the united states a decade in paris and travel in parts of europe africa asia and latin america all of it had given him a focus that few black americans at the time tried to accept or understand either for the benefit of ourselves the world or for richard wright and many whites have not accepted or tried to understand it since he was before his time and as all men who break forth with the truth before the world seems to be ready for it he sufferedchided misunderstood accused of abandoning america and its racial problem for another orbit dying finally before some of the predictions he made about the future would come true his death in  at the beginning of a decade in transition for america africa and asiaall three about which he had written so muchbrought the end of a literary career that had produced  published books innumerable poems short stories essays book reviews dramatic works and speeches in the late forties he had chosen to take leave of the u s the country in which he had been a secondclass citizen but where in his own way he had always been one step ahead together with his wife and young daughter he now finally left it all behind before leaving he had written five books depicting americas racial situation the american decade that followedbringing mccarthyism the korean war the eisenhower era and the long overdue supreme court desegregation ruling of was one in which because he had once been a communist he would have been made to suffer but perhaps with a gift of prophecy the mccarthy days found him away interpreting the racial situation in other areas he was in bandung writing his own analysis on the future of asia and africa and in africa making notes for a book on the colonial heritage of the gold coast ghana his book on africa in  black_power antedated by  years the two words stokely carmichael turned into a now famous phrase and told of kwame nkrumah before most of the world had heard of him or could pronounce his name he took his family off to paris during a period when he and his jewish wife ellen could not without harassment and embarrassment rent property in new yorks greenwich village or buy it in new england when lynchings in the south were still not uncommon when jim crowism in the south and in many places in the north was still written into law and when he was the preeminent black figure in american letters not only because he was talented but because only one black writer at a time especially in richard wrights time could be eminent in american letters he had been forced to become a spokesman for a black population of then  people all the conditions of living and writing in such an atmosphere had become too much finallyafter first one visit to france in  followed by a brief return to the united states then a decision to go to france soon after to liveexile became the answer from his first departure until the appearance of the outsider in  no new book from richard wright would come for eight years the last to be published before it would be his autobiographical black boy in  the interim years as seen later were crucial to a new phase of his career and some of the most valuable if the least acclaimed of his works would come after this period of silence ellen wright the late authors widow told me in paris in  during an informal talk about the writers work my husband didnt write for almost seven years he was reading then were her affectionate and rather quiet wordshe was reading reading reading his silence in a way that silence can be golden gave him a new psychological distance and perspective that some black americansthose who have it and have revealed ithave come to usually in only one of three ways through serving as we would discover through malcolm_x time in prison or by going as ralph ellisons invisible man did in a sense underground or as with richard wright by living for a time in exile it does not usually happen by living in the mainstream of american life but by living outside it out of the period of richard wright in parismidway between africa and americahe emerged to reveal not only what it meant to be a black american but the meaning of being a black man in the western world and with this discovery he probed not only himself and his past but the western psychein a way that no black writer in the u s had ever probed it or been able to probe it or in quite the same way has probed it since he knew and understood what slavery had done in america and he discovered what colonialism had done in africa and asiaa lesson which american history hiding both the legend of slave revolts and the colonial west had not wholly taught him he learned it himself and nearly a decade after his death that same lesson is being taught now only because the independence of africa and asia the war in vietnam and a new black militancy have all made it a lesson which can no longer be ignored he became as men in exile do a cultural interloper living between two worlds and as a black man africa inevitably would become part of one or both those worlds to come face to face with this reality is to assume loyalty to one world or the other or to become a neutral and richard wright in his outlook and stance from all indications had become something of the lattera neutral man though were he living now it might well have changed but in  in white man listen he would tell us    im not nonwestern im no enemy of the west neither am i an easterner when i look out upon those vast stretches of this earth inhabited by brown black and yellow mensections of the earth in which religion dominates to the exclusion of everything else the emotional and mental landscapemy reactions and attitudes are those of the west i see both worlds from another and third point of view    to set his later work beside that of frantz fanon or the later web du bois after his expatriation of ghana wright by comparison is neither a panafricanist nor a revolutionary and to some black american militants for whom fanon has become both hero and revolutionary example wright today would not quite offer the same appeal both writers died within a year of the otherwright at  in  and fanon at  in and it is impossible not in some way to compare their messages as quite different whereas wright three years before his death would pen the words    the west must aid and yes abet the delicate and tragic elite in asia and establish national areas of living    fanon was telling us at almost the same time though he would not until much later be translated into english  as for us who have decided to break the back of colonialism our historic mission is to sanction all revolts all desperate actions all those abortive attempts in rivers of blood neither man however spared the newly liberated bourgeois african who was the first to exploit the masses at the end of colonial rule but wright unlike fanon despite what some may argue and what richard wright may have believed himself to be was no revolutionary in the sense that like fanon he preached and sanctioned global revolt wright a forerunner on paper courageous and the father of the black american literary revolution had few contemporary rivals but his work when put beside that of some black american writers today would be considered mild in tone and message to say the least but it was he who as a kind of franctireur of the black literary vanguard had given us the first warningwho  years before the report from the presidents commission on civil disorders was ever thought of had presented to us all that it could ever say with his native son and before the first signs of neocolonialism would appear along with what some now call wars of liberation occurring in countries of third world he was trying to give the message of how to avoid holocaust with white man listen exile had made him at one with himself much of the outspoken state of rage and the tone of protest is absent from his later essays and rather than a polemicist he had become a social critic in residence and travel abroad he saw and understood the three ms of western collusion as he called themmissionaries merchants and mercenariesand he spoke out against them but he had come to believe essentially in mans humanity to man that the west might finally end up being less selfish than it had been for  years that the future offered hope however he became in spite of it all in the end one of the most misunderstood black writers of all time he was finally criticized by africans who believed he had misinterpreted africa and flayed also by many american blacks who insisted he had lost touch with the american reality whatever that means in a country which then as now has reality defined by hollywood television madison avenue public relations and two political parties so similar as to be indistinguishable and if he was misunderstood by blacks he was resented as much as a black man could ever be resented by countless whites those who could accept uncle toms children native son bright and morning star twelve million black voices and black boy but could not have a black man tamper with the western myth in literature as in life if white critics could have their way he was to keep his placewrite about what it was like to be black in mississippi or on the south side of chicago and leave the moral judgments about africa asia and socalled western civilization to the white civilizers he had turned his back on the american dream and gone into exile and the white literary establishment began to drop him and politically he would learn that a black american abroad was to be anything but an independent international voice having any overtones of politics if any speaking or writing about america or western policy was to be done it was supposed to be done on a state department tour his travels however produced books inspired them and brought speeches between trips to africa and asia he traveled widely in spain a country he admitted having ignored because of franco and fascism but finally visited at the advice of gertrude stein who shortly before her death told him in paris what he later wrote in pagan spain dick you ought to go to spain youll see the past there youll see what the western world is made of   he saw in spain much of what he saw in africa and asia the reasons christianity had been able to triumph why it could do so over one people and not another and why spain still bound by religious traditions of the th century and by an unquestioning conscience had permitted religion for four centuries to overlap every facet of spanish life he found it like no other country in europe in the th century and he named it pagan spain where james baldwin would tell us what it felt like as a black man to gaze at the cathedral of chartres or to look upon his past in a way that made him despise black people because they had failed to produce rembrandt richard wright would give us the foibles and contradictions of how western mankind lived religion and race and the meaning of tradition played a greater role in his interpretation of europe africa and asia than politics or economics although in apropos preposessions an introduction to black_power he noted he would use throughout the book a marxist analysis of the historical events that had transpired throughout the last five centuries in one part of africa he analyzed finally more through the doctrines of race and religion than through marxist ideology much the same approach is to be found in pagan spain white man listen and a book on the meeting of  afroasian nations in indonesia which he entitled in the colour curtain a report on the bandung conference made obvious in his work is his own knowledge that he traveled through countries as an outsider marginally he saw what insiders are not in a position to see and he showed us what no european no asian or no african traveling in the same places could interpret in quite the same way he had acquired as outsider a double vision and he knew it this double vision of mine he wrote in white man listen stems from my being a product of western civilization and for my racial identity long and deeply conditioned    this condition of being born western and a man of color creates a psychological distance so to speak between me and my environment at bandung at what he called the meeting of the rejected he was present as a westerner and man of color who had known rejection i feel my life has given me some keys he wrote in the colour curtain to what they would say or do im an american negro as such ive had a burden of race consciousness and like many of those from the  nations represented he had a religious background and had been a communist out of the bandung trip came a document encompassing asia africa the left the right race religion communism and all the values of the western world and for all the reasons it was unique he would have trouble finding a publisher the dutch and french did not want it for reasons which need no explanation his own american publisher harpers refused it publication came finally in england as thesiswhether one agrees or not with its presentationit is to be recognized as courageous courageously attempted and courageously written the bandung conference scorned by most of the western world as its judgment day found the then u s secretary referring to it on the american news media before it happened as the socalled afroasian conference and with the approaching united states role in vietnam where american advisors at the time of bandung were already moving in swiftly behind the french it was no doubt judged at the time by many as too political a book for an american author to write or to have writtenespecially if he was black an expatriate and had once been an avowed communist for all the control he had over his life and times richard wright was an honest writer but as a black man living in exile in the capital of the western world his intellectual honesty for all its intent could not be quite as complete as the desire for it before his death he had lived  years in francethe france of a colonial policy in asia and africa the france which had fought to keep indochina french at dienbienphu and battled to crush algerian nationalists in setif kabylia and algiers and though the history of french colonial policy was to be deemed no better or worse than that of the british whom he admonished in black_power the same author who traveled to bandung one year after dienbienphu and had lived in france throughout the algerian war had watched french colonialism go down unwillingly and in defeat and he had remained silent about it but unless part of his life was to become a contradiction he had little other choice through no fault of his own part of the paradox of black americans living in western countries with a colonial history is that to remain silent about it implies a complicity in it for lack of choice rather than complicity as wright showed silence is usually the result but if as camus once wrote by our silence or the stand we take we too enter the fray richard wright for lack of choice had unwillingly entered the fray he had not chosen to be born a westerner it had been thrust upon him and he had been as much westerner in america with its stain of slavery as in europe with its blot of colonialism but unlike fanon who a black french citizen from martinique could attack the french renounce citizenship and did preaching revolution against the french richard wright black american expatriate in france man with a passport but no longer really with a country was doomed to silence about french colonial policy lest he become an unwelcome alien on adopted soil for the moral and intellectual dilemma in which he would inevitably find himself but which he never admitted the french with a history of such moral dilemma long ago introduced the word for it richard wright would become a man in engrenage caught up unwillingly in a situation in which there was little choice but the same choice he had believed himself though essentially a free manan alien liberated on foreign soilunbound by tradition habit culture or country and in a way that he never quite revealedthough it is between the lines of his later workliving in europe had contributed to a mental state of freedom in more ways than being free from racial oppression no longer forced to live by the values of american society nor responsible to think or act according to the traditions of europe and economically independent he was free to create his own values becoming as free perhaps as a black man could ever be free as a citizen of the western world the freedom which gave him his double vision permeated his nonfiction but in fiction neither vision nor freedom would be quite as complete for the same reasons he had acquired freedom in nonfiction he revealed in fiction what can happen to the black writer as foreigner cut off from the sources of the past remembering but no longer living them his characters became cultural interlopers in no work of fiction written abroad during  yearsinclusive of short stories of which there were fewer than novelsdid he penetrate european life or but barely bring any of his characters into it the first novel written in europe the outsider is set alternately in chicago harlem and greenwich village the second savage holiday all of whose characters are white and american has a setting in new york city the third the long dream his last published novel and the first in which he attempted to bring a character into french lifebut has him arriving and going no furtheris the story of fishbelly who decides to leave his native mississippi where the storys action is set and takes a plane for paris in writing what he knew bestmississippi chicago harlem and greenwich village all places he had livedhe did what most black writers who go to paris to live and write do not usually choosing paris as a place to write about the varied works of chester himes and james baldwin written there to name only two are other examples of it wright used paris and mentioned other european locales in his fiction in the way that most american writers have as a backdrop a mood but not a way of life for it to be otherwise is by necessity to have plunged into european life learned its language and its ways in order to transform the experience into fiction if not an american just as wright did writes only of americans in europe a character comes goes but never comes aliveor as with his fishbelly only arrives and because to become more than a foreigner and an onlooker in europe takes time and worktime and work which if one is writing for a livelihood as was richard wright is time which must be spent writingwhat usually comes into american fiction is what he brought the past rather than the present for some black americans to do otherwise as may have also happened to richard wright is an obstacle for both personal and racial reasons to enter the life of europe rather than remain on the periphery to master a foreign language requires submission by its nature to be forced to learn everything over again to do in rome as the romans do accustomed to doing at home in the white mans world some black americans are abroad to escape it rather than enter into it in any way even if not for the same reasons they thus remain outside in the company of each othergathering in favorite cafes keeping company with others who seek the same existing in an expatriate colony richard wright shortly before his death had written a novel island of halluci nation as a sequel to fishbelly on the paris expatriate colony of the fifties the story of its infiltration by espionage agents many of them blacks spying on blacks for the cia his american publisher never took it without a doubt he knew the inner life of the america expatriate colony in paris better than he probably ever realized except for close friends the french he was married to an american lived as an american american familystyle speaking english he read in english probably more often than not and wrote in english and it is more likely that to a worldfamous writer french friends conversed with him in english more often than he was called upon to put his thoughts to them into french the french the most xenophobic of all europeans toward foreignersother than his close friends and the companionship of french intellectuals among them sartre and simone de beauvoirwere not the easiest people for him to know his whole experience abroad however seemed to affect his work in one way or another and much of it a period of adaptability as painful as writing he had undertaken as he would discover himself the most difficult task for a writer to pull up roots in one place and transplant them in another and still turn out valuable work and for a black writer even as prolific as richard wright the experience would not be the same as for ernest hemingway gertrude stein f scott fitzgerald or some lesser american writers who also chose exileand have since been eulogized in a way that wright never has whether at his death he found his exile worth it we will never really know it is more likely he did but those who choose exile dont usually tell us otherwise had he been a less important literary figure or as some american writers who have gone to europe unknown and subsequently become known the issue might not count for so much but rather than an obscure talent he was a major american author who chose europe not only as a place to write but also to spend the rest of his life and whatever he produced later would be judged accordingly unlike james baldwin a relatively unknown writer until he came home to america richard wrights career assumed another burden to compare the works of baldwin and wright as simply two black american writers who lived in paris at the same time is not important they are too different to make an important comparison except that this viewer has for a long time maintained that much of the commercial american success of james baldwin was somewhat due to his attack upon richard wright in part also to his return home which wright even for burial had chosen not to do and because those who set standards of giving titular head to black writers for public consumption elected to give it to james baldwin at wrights death had baldwin remained in europe longer than his year duration he might still be unknown to the american reading public upon his return to america he had written already three books and the fourth published soon after his return nobody knows my name was probably the most fitting title that might have been chosen if for no other reason than to compare the works of baldwin and wright as two black writers who lived abroad there is the necessity to compare them as they now seem to appear during this day when black has achieved an unparalleled vogue in the american popularity syndromeinclusive of writers books on sale if the two are compared as two black writers both equally famous some distinct differences become apparent on the commercial market as to who is being promoted and who isnt the works of james baldwin are all presently available in paperback the works of richard wright in paperback are uncle toms children native son and black boy the only work written abroad paperback or otherwise presently available is white man listen none of the rest are for sale at all but are out of print that wright is dead and baldwin alive would appear as a consequence except that many more american writers dead long before wright are far more accessible in american libraries and bookstores his complete works appear to be available now only in private collections at the schomburg collection in harlem and in the moreland room of howard university the library of congress might also be a complete source except black_power has been omitted from its card catalogue it is known that his later books were not well received in america though most were being translated into foreign languages and accepted well abroad toward wrights downward slide in the united states james baldwin attempted to add what could only appear as a final push he had already made an attempt with everybodys protest novel in notes of a native son during wrights lifetime but it looked as if finally he had been told that to become king of the jungle is to first kill the lion what he did was to throw the corpse of a man who had befriended him to the lions his now famous alas poor richard nobody knows my name after wrights death was probably his greatest literary coup with the establishment outside publication of letter from a region in my mind published as part of the fire next time in the madison avenueminded the new yorker as an example of how far he went with that establishment and how far wright didnt go this writer who had both the good fortune and misfortune of working for the new yorker some years ago suggested in  as a possible story for talk of the town that the magazine do a conversation with ellen wright then in new york city for the first time in  years and  visiting the u s especially for the march on washington the new yorker editor william shawn answered with a polite but abject no encircled with his initial and that was that james baldwin could appear in the magazine book length but a conversation with the widow of richard wright no over a year later in paris i personally interviewed the authors widow myself for a swedish newspaper she had words then on among other subjects james baldwin and the alas poor richard essay they are perhaps more apropos here since she wanted known what her husband was no longer alive or in america to say the disagreements baldwin writes of she said were onesided my husband never indulged in public criticism or open arguments with james baldwin he always considered him baldwin a valuable contribution with the makings of a major talent everything baldwin had to say of him he wright said time and events will settle the course its just unfortunate that certain statements baldwin has made date since the death of richard wright and that they seem an attempt to change his image and create a new one posthumously it is doubtful that the image of richard wright could be affected permanently through the work of james baldwin although the effort seems to have been made more than not that the content and perhaps the volume of the late authors work would have been different had he never left the united states there is no longer any question it would have been different in the way byrons would have been had he never left england joyces had he never left ireland or henry james had he never left america he never produced in a vacuum but he left america and he didnt return he was an expatriate from a land whose foundation is expatriatism and whose heritage is the sons and daughters of expatriates and exslaves as a lonely and troubled intellectual he left his own testament of that heritageof africa of europe and americaa testament from him that had he never left we would not in the same way have had and he passed it on with a vision that was the first and perhaps the last of its kind we may see again from a black american writer in this generation
wright  it was a man t mes   frc s  seems important kptrsk that this fact be re  membered in the new times at the beginning of what already has been labeled as the new black renaissance when richard wright was born in mississippi most black americans lived in the southand not in the urban south at that as he grew up the great migration north was reaching its first peak but the southparticularly mississippiremained very much as it had been since the end of reconstruction the differ  ence between slavery and voluntary servitude was minimal black people still had few rights which white men were bound to respect and the price of survival was bitter adjustment to this fact richard wright spent his childhood and early youth learning the rules of survival eventually he too joined the northward trek and his road led to chicago there in carl sandburgs city of the big shoulders the young mississippian found that the suburbs of his states mentality stretched the length and breadth of the land and that there was no physical journey he could make that would leave him beyond its limits he reached out to whatever refuge there was andfor a long and crucial timehe thought he found an escape in communism that in any case anchored him and freed the clamoring urge to art locked in his tortured psyche he wrote and the various literary organs of the left recognized his gifts and published his works then in  when he was  he published the novel native son which was to break many precedents for a book by a b ack writer and which made him famous for a while he lived the  fe of literary lion in new york but as a literary lion of a certain hue and color made all the d fference after a second book the autobiographical black boy richard wright accepted an invitation from the government of france to come to paris and he went his household now included a wife who was jewish and white and a young daughter julia in france where he was lionized anew richard wright found a kind of freedom it was first of all physical but it also was spiritual and most important of all this freedom had a base which rested on a negatism which his own intelligence must have told him had to be resolved it never really was in any case the writers past had taught him lessons which applied no less to the world and he spoke to the world with several books black_power the color curtain which reflected his insight and his concern time passed another daughter rachel came and richard wright the expatriate hungered for a return to his roots it was this hunger which led him to try a little pathetic farming in the countryside beyond paris fame diminished american publishers grew less interested in his work sinister forces haunted him and finally his health and his marriage were threatened 
so notoriously s void of honesty is white society in this country that any writer made famous by it is an immediate suspect and if he is a negro writer double suspect black writers who are of extreme value to the black community for example cannot by definition be of much value to white society i am thinking of such writers as leroi tones and eldridge cleaver and conversely white writers of national popularity are the black communitys enemy one might say that a writer of richard wrights status is an exception but let me hasten to add that as a chronic black reader of literature i have felt in reading wrights books a strange uneasiness not about the subhuman puppets dangled before me but about the man controlling these puppetswho is really the booker t washington of american letters and is it not the messianic urge for another b t washington that haunts the white critic like irving howe who can so swiftly conclude that wright is ralph ellisons and james baldwins spirtual father because i had barely survived the dirt farms of north carolina myself i stayed away from wright as long as i could and even after i broke down and read native son and enjoyed it and was surprised even then i felt i was patronizing negro literature when i read baldwin ellison jones or cleaver however i read for mvseif i feel   i understand something about myself as a black man and a wr ter i feel involved with these writers lives because they themselves are involved in explaining to themselves and to all who listen to their weird position in white america wright in contrast spent his life explaining someone else ie the bigger thomases to white people indeed bigger existed but not who were anxious to believe that wright himself it is not that the social reality portrayed by wright is false but that in so far as it represents wrights own life it is   i do not wish to use the word lie so lets say simply that wright availed himself of a literary convention anyone wishing to view the distance between the benighted bigger thomas and the enlightened richard wright with more accurate measurement should compare for example wrights attitude towards white women in his fiction and his attitude towards them in his biography and his autobiographical works by insisting on the disparity between wrights life and the social reality he created i am not saying that wright was dishonest and that he betrayed however unwittingly the values of the black community rather to emphasize the extent to which literature is dependent for its impetus and impact on literary fashions and conventions one should avoid the implication of wrights social reality that south chicago was worse in the s than it is now wright wrote about chicago in the manner that he did because that was what white america was ready to accept in terms of literary fashion and social imagery or more accurately needed to accept white america branded wright the official negro protester the  genuine article to reject him was to reject official genuine negro protest no matter what your own experience as a negro might have been in terms of popularity wright was the great american writer and in europe even more soand probably for the same reason that patch of blue was so popular in denmark i remember walking out of that movie in copenhagen trying to explain to sympathetic danish friends its not that simple i mean its more complex why i rejected the movies reality to reject wrights art is not to reject protest it is to reject negative protest to reject the white mans concept of protest which is that of a raging ferocious uncool demoralized black boy banging on the immaculate door of white society begging not so much for political justice as for his own identity and in the process consuming himself so that in the final analysis his destiny is at the mercy of the white man no to reject wright is not to reject protest it is to reject negative protest every black person who realizes how sick american white society is by the logic of this awareness makes a protest a positive protest this is a delicate point which the oversimplification of  wrights social reality has obscured positive protest that creates as it eliminates it deals with the oppositions ugliness by concentrating on its own beauty leroi jones prose is positive protest because it is witty and beautiful to black people which means simply white people cannot understand it black children in the doorways of the ghetto doing the james brown or the uptight are positive protest directed against white people because white people cant dance negro digest is positive protest against the readers digest every ghettoi do not mean slumis positive protest against white insipid suburbs black people together involved with their lives carrying on with their black and bluesy culture is positive protest against the simpleness and the uninterestedness that haunt the abstracted lives of middleclass whites  the argument that the value in richard wrights work lies in how well it describes the specific social climate that produced it is nothing more that a rationalization for the mans success and an erroneous one at that for it misses the point that it was wrights attitude towards the negro writer and negro literature that led him to believe there was a gold mine in explaining to white america the lives of black people it was his definition of negro writer that led him to select from his own vast and rich experiences those horrifying scraps from which emerged a dozen or so unbelievably dumb negroes just as the monster was created not by frankenstein but by mary shelley so wrights creation cannot be foisted off on society if we want to get to the key to wrights work we would do best by examining the theories of fiction wright accepted during his day a crucial question in wrights definition of the negro writer had to do with subjectmatter which stated simply that a negro writer was someone who wrote about negro life jesus this would make jessie hill ford nat hentoff robert penn warren and wiliam faulkner negro writers and as though this was not enough there was definite itemized catalog ie setpieces of what constituted negro lifethis of course was a much easier way out than saying negro life is anything that a negro does because this leaves a definition of negro too opened and baby white people werent having that just yet an intellectual life literary success marriage to a white woman for example did not constitute negro life at least not for the white reading public which explains why wright published not one scratch about this aspect of his life in order to see how black writing handles this compare for example the manner in which leroi jones handles these aspects of his life in plays dutchman and the slave wright believed as far too many people still do that there are certain categories which constitute black experience and others white experience that these white and black categories are and this is a shame ascribed with you when you are born and cannot be shaken by individual will for wright it was his damnation to be born black and his will to achieve whitenessie to pull himself up to the literary standards of white america the tenets of black writing today are the reverse of what wright believed for black writing a black writer is first of all black which means simply that he accepts the standards of black people over those of white america every negro baby in america is bom white born that is into a world of white values and if he is to survive that world he has to achieve blackness somewhere in the marrow of his youth must be that experience that awakening that rebirth jesus talked so much about which must carry him over to accept the reality of blackness this journey is ultimately an achievement of both grace and ones own will one must as ellison so strongly insists upon will to be a negro being a negro american involves a willed who wills to be a negro  do affirmation of self against all outside pressures but the irving howe types freedom can be fought for but it cannot always be willed or asserted into existence wishes this werent so so then a black writer is not just some colored person trying to prove to white society that he is not a nigger orand that if he is white society is to blame no when we meet the black writer in the pages of his work we encounter  someone who has achieved and willed an identity of blackness someone who has accepted negro life not as a burden as ellison puts it but as a discipline subjectmatter then is not part of the criteria in determining a black writer but quality of life will discipline and moral courage are a black writer can write about anything i mean this literally and what he has to say will still be said by a black man as leroi jones puts it if i say i am a black man all my writing is done by a black man whether i label each thing i write written by a black its still written by a black man so that if i point out a bird a black man has pointed out that bird and it is the weight of that experience in me and the way i get it from where it is to you that says whether or not i am a writer anger and beyond p  the tragedy of richard wrights life is that he subscribed to a definition of the negro writer that was perniciously paradoxical on the one hand the role of the negro writer as wright saw it allowed him the potent power of the raging satirist while at the very same time rendered him in the last years of his life impotent and exiled it was near impossible for wright to change his ideas about the function of the writer because such ideas were as always intricately woven into the writers definition of his self to me wright as writer was less interesting than the enigma he personified ellison can say that he could so dissociate himself from the complexity of his background while trying so hard to improve the condition of black men everywhere that he could be so wonderful an example of human possibility but could not for ideological reasons depict a negro as intelligent as creative or as dedicated as himself anger and beyond p  wrights idea of a negro writer was extremely middleclass which means that he believed that what white society thought to be negro reality was more important than what negroes knew to be their reality wright was exiled because his definition of negro life was too narrow too confining too puny and too dependent on white society wright was afraid to define negro life too broadly for fear it would cease to be negro a weird kind of insecurity ill it was wrights conception of what he thought his function as a negro writer should be that is primarily responsible for his style ie his attitude towards his reader and his characters the negro world that wright wrote about was so strange so far from the lives of his white audience that wright indulged too often in the explanatory the negro characters that he created are usually so subhuman so dumb that for the most part wright was forced to stand in the pages of his fiction as a kind of negro spokesman in order for a work of fiction to mean anything it must first of all involve the reader for a black reader it is difficult to become involvedi mean really involved with wrights characters because he is always there intruding with his commentary explaining as it were what to a black reader needs no apologetic explanation this explanatory mood of wrights resulted finally in a dull dessicated   prosaic sentence structure that leaves nothing to the readers imagination it is not as some critics have stated that wright doesnt have a sense of humor in his fiction it is simply that his prose style strangles his humor which like most elements of black culture has nuances that are difficult to grasp with discursive prose it is only after we have laid the story aside for some time and have allowed our minds to rearrange the images the setting the tone of wrights stories only after that methodical and  plodding rhythm of his prose has ceased to reverberate in our minds that we appreciate his humour one of the reasons incidentally that leroi jones is such a funny writer the alternative has to be one of the funniest stories ever written in america is that his style is essentially poetic and this is why too in tales he can convey so much of negro life poetry rather than prose seems to be the tool that is best for conveying the subtleties the nuances the complexity of negro culture wrights style is about as close to poetry as say booker t washingtons or richard nixons with the exception of two stories man of all work and man god aint like that     both of which were written in dialogue which was wrights forte the book eight men is the dullest i have ever read everywhere the reader turns in the book there is the dumb subhuman animallike nigger and his eloquent interpreter who possessing some smattering of sociological theories usually has the responsibility of forging the animals actions into some acceptable universal or literary theme take for instance the first few lines of the very first story the man who was almost a man dave struck out across the fields looking homeward through paling light whuts the use talkin wid em niggers in the field anyhow his mother was putting supper on the table them niggers cant understan nothing one of these days he was going to get a gun and practice shooting then they couldnt talk to him as though he were a little boy p id wrights negroes never think although wright will tell you they do this is left up to wrightas ellison said wright could imagine bigger but bigger could not possibly imagine richard wright wright saw to that the third is by the narrator ie wright but it is and this is importantonly an interpretation of what presumably the character is thinking the fourth which is dave speaking again is fused with the narrators interpretation and finally the fifth sentence although written in the language of the narrator is the thoughts of the boyor is it the narrator putting words into the boys mouth the problem is this we believe we know something about the boys mind but we cant be sure for after all it was reported to us by the narrator we can never really know the boy the narrator stands between us such that at the end of the story our feeling towards the boy are ambivalent and anxious this anxiety builds up to disastrous proportions if in the course of the story the protagonist is the victim of violence because one is forced to feel great sympathy for someone one does not know and does not know why maybe this is why upon finishing each of these stories i felt a bit frustrated and unsatisfied the long short story the man who lived underground collected in eight men suffers greatly from wrights dumb negroeloquent spokesman device the story cites he adventures of a negro murderer fred who lives in a manhole making robinson crusoetvpe discoveries fred is quite childish and when he finds a stack of money unlike crusoe with his mature sense of what monev can do in english societv fred is only intrigued with the form and color of ptl he steals a typewriter and radio upon which he literally sperds hours tinkering like a  yearold but it is not of a child wright wants us to think his  s imagining fred as a subhuman as some human who has become less human because he has been shut out of whte society and this is what ic behind wrights statement about tred    never in fredsl life had he used a typewriterl it was a oueer instrument of business somethin beyond the rim of his life italics addedas though usig a typewriter is going to add something to the quality of ones life fone is reminded of course of te demoralized bigger thomas who wants to do things to fly airolanes like white boys a cryin shame yet this subhuman who has no humanity to speak of or at least one is not convinced of it is transformed into an intellectual before the story endsbecause wright has to give the thing a universal theme he selects the theme of orestes and the furies fred then marches out  of his manhole into the police station and confesses he is guilty the police try to convince him that they had already caught the murderer of the woman whom fred claims he killed the story ends when fred finally persuades two policemen to go down into the underground to witness what he had experienced so that at last he would be free of his burden when they are deep in the tunnel one of the police shoots him with the explanation youve got to shoot his kind theyd wreck things wright not only ended up with the universal theme but he even achieved a bit of tearjerker what black writing has come to realize is that meaning ie theme is always implied in the image one has only to paint the metaphor of blacknessthe whole community despite its pretense to the contrary knows that the meaning is and again the history of black people in this country is within itself a universal themethe most universal of themes what universal theme means that is in wright is to write so white people can understandie without really understanding  in the few stories in which wright left off the dscursive prose and let his character do their own explaining he created masterpieces in lawd today for example the dialogue gets as close to poetry as wright ever got in this novel the dialogue is fascinating because it is used to provoke the atmosphere the mood of black people that the most skilled prose writer would have difficulty in capturing the last fourth of the book is the best piece of writing wright accomplished the proof of this being in the fact that one can return to it and reread it again and again the novel depicts one day in the life of a postal clerk and in order to give the events his inevitable commentary wright has that day happen on february  abraham lincolns birthday throughout the novel there are brief reminders of the civil war reminders that are so planted in the novel as to remind the reader that these negroes although wrapped in their own black culture are not free yet if this novel in its celebration of negro life could shake itself free of wrights commentary device it would rival native son as being wrights most valuable book ill i have been talking about technique and style and how they were influenced by wrights definition of the negro writer let me now deal with the treatment of theme which in wrights work was as subject to being dictated by white society as well as style let us take for example the theme of the white woman and her relationship with the black man there is only one kind of interaction between these two and that is one of unadulterated violence inflicted by the black male who is imaged as an animal this relationship is as rigid and codified as any element of medieval sym bolism the idea that a white woman is only a human being and one to whom it is possible to feel something other than hate is an idea that wrights blacks are incapable of this despite the fact that wrights own experience taught him otherwise when max is questioning bigger thomas about his alleged rape and murder of the white girl mary dalton he suggests that bigger might have liked mary biggers reaction is depicted as that of an animals did you like her max asked like her biggers voice boomed so suddenly from his throat that max started bigger leaped to his feet his eyes widened and his hands lifted midway to face trembling italics added no no bigger    max said p  thus bigger the prototype nigger in his attitude towards the white woman is more of a creation of white society which is why white men like irving howe can so eagerly lay claim to him than he is of any black mans and so are those other black males in the pages of wrights fiction whose only response to white women is to chop off their heads concerning this baldwin has written in most of the novels by negroes until today    there is a great space where sex ought to be and what usually fills this space is violence this violence as in so much of wrights work is gratuitoils and compulsive it is one of the severest criticisms that can be leveled against his work the violence is never examined i do not believe that wright did not examine that violence if it existed in his personal life what seems to be the case is that wright subscribed to a literary convention that had as much to do with life as say menthol cigarettes a convention responsible only to white society one could k for example at the treatment of the theme of the white woman in an autobiographical story called the man who went to chicago in which the hero is an intelligent young man whom we must recognize as none other than the author and his attitude towards white women is simply normal it is only when wright had to create fictional characters that he insisted on gratuitous violence iv native son bigger thomas like othello another victim of white society is dumb but whereas othellos error lies in othello in his perception biggers lies in bad style in richard wright biggers dumbness is only a thematic device wright is not so much interested in the character of bigger as he is in using whatever literary conventions to make an ideological point thus at the beginning of the novel it is convenient to have bigger extremely stupid for purposes of motivation and after the murder again it is convenient to give bigger some awareness of  his crime thus adding to the significance of the crime as a theme so that on page  bigger is so stupid that he doesnt know what a communist is when his friend helps him with a communist is a red he dumbly asks whats a red yet on page  he is suddenly ruminating on world issues of late he had liked to hear tell of men who could rule others for in actions such as these he felt that here was an escape from his tight morass of fear and shame that sapped at the base of his life he liked to hear of how japan was conquering china of how hitler was running the jews to the ground of how mussolini was invading spain one ceases to believe in bigger as a character and there are moments when the reader grasps at biggers action and the ideas behind them with the same awe and lack of understanding that his own family did and this happens because one feels he does not know bigger which is because he doesnt exist as a human being a rebel without a brain biggers tragedy is a personal one and it exists in the fact that he simply refuses to cannot see wrights tragedy is that he fails to condemn this blindness though it may be that biggers demoralization is wrights ie wright as artist bigger for instance prides himself on the knowledge that no one would ever think that a black timid negro like himself was responsible or is this wright putting words in his mouth    for he felt that they white people ruled him even when they were far away and not thinking of him ruled him by conditioning him in his relations to his own people p  bigger is only embodying a fantasy white society created for him long ago and this is why he feels that the murder is an act of creation he talks about the murder bringing out the hidden meaning of his life this has to be taken ironically because what is really meant is that bigger a kind of racial correlative objective was created to serve white society biggei wanted to be white but he wasnt smart enough to see that what can be had in whiteness can most certainly be had in blackness why couldnt wright see this v criticsblack and white the distance between bigger thomas and richard wright even after the publication of black boy was so notoriously great that ellison in his famous essay richard wrights blues set out to explain it by discussing some of its cultural sources i hope to answer those critics who would make of the book a miracle and of its author a mystery one of those cultural sources ellison took to be the blues and so began his essay a much quoted paragraph on the function of the blues after this insightful opening ellison dwindles into some wellstated sociology about the southern rural family and has nothing else to say about the blues except in the last paragraph despite its title and general ini tent ellisons essay in retrospect sheds much doubt on whether wright ever really understood the blues in another essay a rejoinder published  years later ellison disparages wrights knowledge of blues and says hemingway was more important to me than wright not because he was white or more accepted but because he appreciated the things of this earth which i love and which wright was too driven or deprived or inexperienced to know hemingways love for life ellison says in couiiterdistinction was very close to the feeling of the blues in terms of explaining wright i think ellison was much closer when he said recently that wright was as much a product of his reading as of his painful experiences and he made himself a writer by subjecting himself to the writers disciplineas he understood it this changing critical attitude of ellisons toward wright i cite as an example of how critical theory has changed in the last  years it is interesting too that during the writing of his essay ellisons criticism was about as equally imbued with sociological theories as was wrights writing baldwins criticism of the protest novel everybodys protest novel in general and his essay alas poor richard in particular is very good critically on wright and precisely because baldwin stayed clear of theorieswell at least sociological ones irving howe is typical of the white critics who harbor a vested interest in richard wrights negroes in his now famous essay black boys and native sons howe claims his disagreement with ellison and baldwin has something to do with protest but howes real objection is that these writers unlike wright refuse to create demoralized unintelligible subhumans whose sole lifetime concern is consumed in hating the invincible force as howe lkes to imagine it of the white world rather these writers have given us humane courageous profound aware conscious heroes who are reallv more  j concerned with themselves and their own realities than with those of white jewish intellectuals lke howe whom wright apparently was so respectful of howe accuses baldwin and ellison of not protesting but what he refuses to acknowledge is that baldwin and ellison for all their faults by virtue of their existence as excellent moral craftsmen are protesting their protest is positive protest because in addition to blasting the white world ie not letting white people get to them they erect black positive images richard wright begged baldwin ellison leroi jones eldridge cleaver are not begging and this upsets the howetypes because they need to hear the rasping rage of groveling demoralized bigger thomases at the door of white society in order to be assured themselves that white society still exists  as the only possible alternative for the negro personality howe writes for example that in native son wright struggles to transcend violence that he did not fully succeed seems obvious one may doubt that any negro writer could now this cracker must be kidding because almost every black writer i know of has transcended violence at least that violence of biggers howe like wright believes that violence is the negro writers lot not to write about violence is to avoid writing about negro life this is why he finds giovannis room a flat failure because it abandons negro life entirely finally howe assigns wright as spiritual father to both ellison and baldwin  ellison because he didnt come around to protest is suffering as a result but baldwin has come around baldwins most recent novel another country is a protest novel quite as much as native son    no longer is baldwins prose so elegant or suave as it once was in this book it is harsh clumsy heavybreathng wth the pant of suppressed bitterness obviously this white man is speaking of negative protest demoralized protest and not the protest of james brown or leroi jones in other words positive protest that asserts its own beauty if you will its own elegance as it protests is not viable well howe and his buddies had better wake up or not wake up as they wish
in that limited and almost barren field known as the negro novel arna bontemps black thunder fills a yawning gap and fills it competently covering all those skimpy reaches of negro letters i know this is the only novel dealing forthrightly with the historical and revolutionary traditions of the negro people black thunder is the true story of a slave insurrection that failed but in his telling of the story of that failure bontemps manages to reveal and dramatize through the character of his protagonist gabriel a quality of folk courage unparalleled in the proletarian literature of this country gabriel is a young slave who hearing of the struggles of the french proletariat and the exploits of louverture decides to avenge the murder of a fellowslave by leading the negroes of richmond virginia against the landowners on the night when the attack is to take place gabriels ragged slavehost armed with cutlasses pikes and a peck of bullets hides in the woods near richmond waiting for the call to advance and capture the arsenal at the crucal moment a terrific rainstorm sweeps down flooding the fields and bogging the roads this coupled with the treachery of two members of his band makes the uprising impossible gabriels army deserts him the next three weeks are times of wild terror for everywhere the white plantation owners are asking one another what negro can you point to and say definitely he is not involved from that juncture onward black thunder is mainly the story of gabriel who believes in the eventual triumph of his destiny in spite of all the forces which conspire against it he is convinced that god and the universe are on his side he believes he must and will lead the negro people to freedom he seems to have no personal fear and no personal courage he thinks dreams and feels wholly in terms of negro liberation his mind is a confused mixture of superstition naive cunning idealism and a high courage born partly of his deep ignorance and partly of an amazing ability to forget his personal safety he contemptuously refuses to run to the mountains to save himself and decides to stay near the scene of the insurrection to get in twothree mo good licks fo my time comes when considering gabriel solely as an isolated individual he seems sustained by an extremely foolish belief in himself but when one remembers his slave state when one realizes the extent to which he has made the wrongs of his people his wrongs and the degree in which he has submerged his hopes in their hopeswhen one remembers this he appears logically and gloriously invincible the plan for the uprising is so simple and daring that when it is disclosed and tracked to its source the fearridden whites can scarcely believe it but gabriel believes he believes even when he is caught even when the black cowl is capped about his head even when the ax swings he believes why for me the cardinal value of bontemps book besides the fact that it is a thumping story well told lies in the answer to that question perhaps i am straying further afield than the author did in search for an answer if i do it is because i believe we have in black thunder a revelation of the very origin and source of folk values in literature even though gabriels character is revealed in terms of personal action and dialogue i feel there is in him much more than mere personal dignity and personal courage there is in his attitude something which transcends the limits of immediate consciousness he is buoyed in his hope and courage by an optimism which takes no account of the appalling difficulties confronting him he hopes when there are no objective reasons or grounds for hope he fights when his fellowslaves scamper for their lives in doing so he takes his place in that gallery of fictitious characters who exist on the plane of the ridiculous and the sublime bontemps endows gabriel with a myth and deathless quality and it is in this sense i believe that black thunder sounds a new note in negro fiction thereby definitely extending the boundaries and ideology of the negro novel
she stood with her black face some six inches from the moist windowpane and wondered when on earth would it ever stop raining it might keep up like this all week she thought she heard rain droning upon the roof and high up in the wet sky her eyes followed the silent rush of a bright shaft of yellow that swung from the airplane beacon in far off memphis momently she could see it cutting through the rainy dark it would hover a second like a gleaming sword above her head then vanish she sighed troubling johnnyboys been trampin in this slop all day wid no decent shoes on his feet    through the window she could see the rich black earth sprawling outside in the night there was more rain than the clav could soak up pools stood everywhere she yawned and mumbled rains good n bad it kin make seeds bus up thu the groun er it kin bog things down lika watahsoaked coffin her hands were folded loosely over her stomach and the hot air of the kitchen traced a filmy veil of sweat on her forehead from the cook stove came the soft singing of burning wood and now and then a throaty bubble rose from a pot of simmering greens shucks johnnyboy coulda let somebody else do all tha runnin in the rain theres others bettah fixed fer it than he is but naw johnnyboy ain the one t trust nobody t do nothin hes gotta do it all hissef    she glanced at a pile of damp clothes in a zinc tub waal ah bettah git t work she turned lifted a smoothing iron with a thick pad of cloth touched a spitwet finger to it with a quick jerking motion smiiiitz yeah its hot stooping she took a blue workshirt from the tub and shook it out with a deft twist of her shoulder she caught the iron in her right hand the fingers of her left hand took a piece of wax from a tin box and a frying sizzle came as she smeared the bottom she was thinking of nothing now her hands followed a lifelong ritual of toil spreading a sleeve she ran the hot iron to and fro until the wet cloth became stiff she was deep in the midst of her work when a song rose up out of the far off days of her childhood and broke through halfparted lips hes the lily of the valley the bright n mawnin star hes the fairest of ten thousan t mah soul    a gust of wind dashed rain against the window johnnyboy oughta c mon home n eat his suppah aw lawd ltd be fine ef sug could eat wid us tonight ltd be like ol times mabbe aftah all it wont be long for he comes back tha lettah ah got from im las week said don give up hop    yeah we gotta live in hope then both of her sons sug and johnnyboy would be back with her with an involuntary nervous gesture she stopped and stood still listening but the only sound was the lulling fall of rain shucks ain no usa me ackin this way she thought ever time they gits ready to hoi them meetings ah gits jumpity ah been a lil scared ever since sug went t jail she heard the clock ticking and looked johnnyboys a hour late he sho mus be havin a time doin all that trampin trampin thu the mud    but her fear was a quiet one it was more like an intense brooding than a fear it was a sort of hugging of hated facts so closely that she could feel their grain like letting cold water run over her hand from a faucet on a winter morning she ironed again faster now as if she felt the more she engaged her body in work the less she would think but how could she forget johnnyboy out there on those wet fields rounding up white and black communists for a meeting tomorrow and that was just what sug had been doing when the sheriff had caught him beat him and tried to make him tell who and where his comrades were po sug they sho musta beat the boy somethin awful but thank gawd he didnt talk he ain no weaklin sug ain hes been lionhearted all his life long that had happened a year ago and now each time those meetings came around the old terror surged back while shoving the iron a cluster of toiling days returned days of washing and ironing to feed johnnyboy and sug so they could do party work days of carrying a hundred pounds of white folks clothes upon her head across fields sometimes wet and sometimes dry but in those days a hundred pounds was nothing to carry carefully balanced upon her head while stepping by instinct over the corn and cotton rows the only time it had seemed heavy was when she had heard of sugs arrest she had been coming home one morning with a bundle upon her head her hands swinging idly by her sides walking slowly with her eyes in front of her when bob johnnyboys pal had called from across the fields and had come and told her that the sheriff had got sug that morning the bundle had become heavier than she could ever remember and with each passing week now though she spoke of it to no one things were becoming heavier the tubs of water and the smoothing iron and the bundle of clothes were becoming harder to lift with her back aching so and her work was taking longer all because sug was gone and she didnt know just when johnnyboy would be taken too to ease the ache of anxiety that was swelling her heart she hummed then sang softly he walks wid me he talks wid me he tells me ahm his own    guiltily she stopped and smiled looks like ah jus cant seem t fergit them ol songs no mattah how hard ah tries    she had learned them when she was a little girl living and working on a farm every monday morning from the corn and cotton fields the slow strains had floated from her mothers lips lonely and haunting and later as the years had filled with gall she had learned their deep meaning long hours of scrubbing floors for a few cents a day had taught her who jesus was what a great boon it was to cling to him to be like him and suffer without a mumbling word she had poured the yearning of her life into the songs feeling buoyed with a faith beyond this world the figure of the man nailed in agony to the cross his burial in a cold grave his transfigured resurrection his being breath and clay god and manall had focused her feelings upon an imagery which had swept her life into a wondrous vision but as she had grown older a cold white mountain the white folks and their laws had swum into her vision and shattered her songs and their spell of peace to her that white mountain was temptation something to lure her from her lord a part of the world god had made in order that she might endure it and come through all the stronger just as christ had risen with greater glory from the tomb the days crowded with trouble had enhanced her faith and she had grown to love hardship with a bitter pride she had obeyed the laws of the white folks with a soft smile of secret knowing after her mother had been snatched up to heaven in a chariot of fire the years had brought her a rough working man and two black babies sug and johnnyboy all three of whom she had wrapped in the charm and magic of her vision then she was tested by no less than god her man died a trial which she bore with the strength shed by the grace of her vision finally even the memory of her man faded into the vision itself leaving her with two black boys growing tall slowly into manhood then one day grief had come to her heart when johnnyboy and sug had walked forth demanding their lives she had sought to fill their eyes with her vision but they would have none of it and she had wept when they began to boast of the strength shed by a new and terrible vision but she had loved them even as she loved them now bleeding her heart had followed them she could have done no less being an old woman in a strange world and day by day her sons had ripped from her startled eyes her old vision and image by image had given her a new one different but great and strong enough to fling her into the light of another grace the wrongs and sufferings of black men had taken the place of him nailed to the cross the meager beginnings of the party had become another resurrection and the hate of those who would destroy her new faith had quickened in her a hunger to feel how deeply her new strength went lawd johnnyboy she would sometimes say ah jus wan them white folks t try t make me tell who is in the party n who ainl ah jus wan em t try n ahll show em somethin they never thought a black woman could have but sometimes like tonight while lost in the forgetfulness of work the past and the present would become mixed in her while toiling under a strange star for a new freedom the old songs would slip from her lips with their beguiling sweetnessthe iron was getting cold she put more wood into the fire stood again at the window and watched the yellow blade of light cut through the wet darkness johnnyboy ain here yit    then before she was aware of it she was still listening for sounds under the drone of rain she heard the slosh of feet in mud tha ain johnnyboy she knew his long heavy footsteps in a million she heard feet come on the porch some woman    she heard bare knuckles knock three times then once thas some of them comrades she unbarred the door cracked it a few inches and flinched from the cold rush of damp wind whos tha its me who me reva she flung the door open lawd chile c mon in she stepped to one side and a thin blondhaired white

don know when hes gonna show up somebodys gotta tell them comrades t stay erway from yo pas house she stood with her back to the window looking at revas wide blue eyes po critter gotta go back thu all tha slop though she felt sorry for reva not once did she think that it would not have to be done being a woman reva was not suspect she would have to go it wis just as natural for reva to go back through the cold rain as it was for her to iron night and day or for sug to be in jail right now johnnyboy was out there on those dark fields trying to get home lawd don let em git im tonight in spite of herself her feelings became torn she loved her son and loving him she loved what he was trying to do johnnyboy was happiest when he was working for the party and her love for him was for his happiness she frowned trying hard to fit something together in her feelings for her to try to stop johnnyboy was to admit that all the toil of years meant nothing and to let him go meant that sometime or other he would be caught like sug in facing it this way she felt a little stunned as though she had come suddenly upon a blank wall in the dark but outside in the rain were people white and black whom she had known all her life those people depended upon johnnyboy loved him and looked to him as a man and leader yeah hes gotta keep on he cant stop now    she looked at reva she was crying and pulling her shoes back on with reluctant fingers whut you carryin on tha way fer chile yuh done los sug now yuh sending johnnyboy    a got t honey she was glad she could say that reva believed in black folks and not for anything in the world would she falter before her in revas trust and acceptance of her she had found her first feelings of humanity revas love was her refuge from shame and degradation if in early days of her life the white mountain had driven her back from the earth then in her last days revas love was drawing her toward it like the beacon that swung through the night outside she heard reva sobbing hush honey mah brothers in jail too ma cries ever day    ah know honey she helped reva with her coat her fingers felt the scant flesh of the girls shoulders she don git ernuff t eat she thought she slipped her arms around revas waist and held her close for a moment now yuh stop that cryin aaah cccant hep it    everythingll be awright johnnyboyll be back yuh think so sho chile cos he will neither of them spoke again until they stood in the doorway outside they could hear water washing through the ruts of the street be sho n send johnnyboy t tell the folks t stay erway from pas house said reva ahll tell im don yuh worry goodbye goodbye leaning against the door jamb she shook her head slowly and watched reva vanish through the falling rain ii she was back at her board ironing when she heard feet sucking in the mud of the back yard feet she knew from long years of listening were johnnyboys but tonight with all the rain and fear his coming was like a leaving was almost more than she could bear tears welled to her eyes and she blinked them away she felt that he was coming so that she could give him up to see him now was to say goodbye but it was a goodbye she knew she could never say they were not that way toward each other all day long they could sit in the same room and not speak she was his mother and he was her son most of the time a nod or a grunt would carry all the meaning that she wanted to convey to him or he to her she did not even turn her head when she heard him come stomping into the kitchen she heard him pull up a chair sit sigh and draw off his muddy shoes they fell to the floor with heavy thuds soon the kitchen was full of the scent of his drying socks and his burning pipe tha boys hongry she paused and looked at him over her shoulder he was puffing at his pipe with his head tilted back and his feet propped up on the edge of the stove his eyelids drooped and his wet clothes steamed from the heat of the fire lawd tha boy gits mo like his pa ever day he lives she mused her lips breaking in a slow faint smile hols tha pipe in his mouth just like his pa usta hoi his wondah how they woulda got erlong ef his pa had lived they oughta liked each other they so mucha like she wished there could have been other children besides sug so johnnyboy would not have to be so much alone a man needs a woman by his side    she thought of reva she liked reva the brightest glow her heart had ever known was when she had learned that reva loved johnnyboy but beyond reva were cold white faces ef theys caught it means death    she jerked around when she heard johnnyboys pipe clatter to the floor she saw him pick it up smile sheepishly at her and wag his head gawd ahm sleepy he mumbled she got a pillow from her room and gave it to him here she said hunh he said putting the pillow between his head and the back of the chair they were silent again yes she would have to tell him to go back out into the cold rain and slop maybe to get caught maybe for the last time she didnt know but she would let him eat and get dry before telling him that the sheriff knew of the meeting to be held at lems tomorrow and she would make him take a big dose of soda before he went out soda always helped to stave off a cold she looked at the clock it was eleven theres time yit spreading a newspaper on the apron of the stove she placed a heaping plate of greens upon it a knife a fork a cup of coffee a slab of cornbread and a dash of peach cobbler yo suppahs ready she said yeah he said he did not move she ironed again presently she heard him eating when she could no longer hear his knife tinkling against the edge of the plate she knew he was through it was almost twelve now she would let him rest a little while longer before she told him till one erclock mabbe hes so tired    she finished her ironing put away the board and stacked the clothes in her dresser drawer she poured herself a cup of black coffee drew up a chair sat down and drank yuh almos dry she said not looking around yeah he said turning sharply to her the tone of voice in which she had spoken had let him know that more was coming she drained her cup and waited a moment longer reva wuz here yeah she lef bout a hour ergo whut she say she said ol man lem hada visit from the sheriff today bout the meetin yeah she saw him stare at the coals glowing red through the crevices of the stove and run his fingers nervously through his hair she knew he was wondering how the sheriff had found out in the silence he would ask a wordless question and in the silence she would answer wordlessly johnnyboys too trustin she thought hes trying t make the party big n hes takin in folks fastern he kin git t know em you cant trust ever white man yuh meet    yuh

gotta take em in wes too weak t be choosy he rose abruptly rammed his hands into his pockets and stood facing the window she looked at his back in a long silence she knew his faith it was deep he had always said that black men could not fight the rich bosses alone a man could not fight with every hand against him but he believes so hard hes blind she thought at odd times they had had these arguments before always she would be pitting her feelings against the hard necessity of his thinking and always she would lose she shook her head po johnnyboy he don know    but ain nona our folks tol johnnyboy she said how yuh know he asked his voice came low and with a tinge of anger he still faced the window and now and then the yellow blade of light flicked across the sharp outline of his black face cause ah know em she said anybody mighta tol he said it wuznt nona our folks she said again she saw his hand sweep in a swift arc of disgust our folks ma who in gawds name is our folks the folks

said here drink this glass of soda watah she watched him drink then put the glass away waal he said take the stuff outta yo pockets she lifted the lid of the stove and he dumped all the papers from his pocket into the fire she followed him to the door and made him turn round lawd yuh tryin to maka revolution n yuh cant even keep yo coat buttoned her nimble fingers fastened his collar high around his throat there he pulled the brim of his hat low over his eyes she opened the door and with the suddenness of the cold gust of wind that struck her face he was gone she watched the black fields and the rain take him her eyes burning when the last faint footstep could no longer be heard she closed the door went to her bed lay down and pulled the cover over her while fully dressed her feelings coursed with the rhythm of the rain hes gone lawd ah know hes gone her blood felt cold she was floating in a grey void somewhere between sleeping and dreaming and then suddenly she was wide awake hearing and feeling in the same instant the thunder of the door crashing in and a cold wind filling the room it was pitch black and she stared resting on her elbows her mouth open not breathing her ears full of the sound of tramping feet and booming voices she knew at once they lookin fer im then filled with her will she was on her feet rigid waiting listening the lamps burnin yuh see her naw look in the kitchen gee this place smells like niggers say somebodys here er been here yeah theres fire in the stove mabbe hes been here n gone boy look at these jars of jam niggers make good jam git

tightly the veins bulged the kitchen was crowded with white men in glistening raincoats though the lamp burned their flashlights still glowed in red fists across her floor she saw the muddy tracks of their boots yuh white folks git outta mah house there was quick silence every face turned toward her she saw a sudden movement but did not know what it meant until something hot and wet slammed her squarely in the face she gasped but did not move calmly she wiped the warm greasy liquor of greens from her eyes with her left hand one of the white men had thrown a handful of greens out of the pot at her how they taste ol bitch ah ast yuh t git outta mah house she saw the sheriff detach himself from the crowd and walk toward her now anty    white man don yuh anty me yuh ain got the right sperit

ain never seen one of yo kind that wuznt too low fer    he slapped her again she reeled backward several feet and fell on her side is tha whut we too low t do she stood before him again dryeyed as

ef we hafta find im well kill im he wont be the only nigger yuh ever killed she said she was consumed with a bitter pride there was nothing on this earth she felt then that they could not do to her but that she could take she stood on a narrow plot of ground from which she would die before she was pushed and then it was while standing there feeling warm blood seeping down her throat that she gave up johnnyboy gave him up to the white folks she gave him up because they had come tramping into her heart demanding him thinking they could get him by beating her thinking they could scare her into making her tell where he was she gave him up because she wanted them to know that they could not get what they wanted by bluffing and killing wheres this meetin gonna be the sheriff asked don yuh wish yuh knowed ain there gonna be a meetin how come yuh astin me there is gonna be a meetin said the sheriff is it ah gotta great mind t choke it outta yuh yuh so smart she said  we ain playin wid

walked past her the others followed yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted she thought exultingly n yuh ain gonna never git it hotly something ached in her to make them feel the intensity of her pride and freedom her heart groped to turn the bitter hours of her life into words of a kind that would make them feel that she had taken all they had done to her in her stride and could still take more her faith surged so strongly in her she was all but blinded she walked behind them to the door knotting and twisting her fingers she saw them step to the muddy ground each whirl of the yellow beacon revealed glimpses of slanting rain her lips moved then she shouted yuh didnt git whut yuh wanted n yuh ain gonna nevah git it the sheriff stopped and turned his voice came low and hard now by gawd thas ernuff outta yuh ah know when ah done said ernuff aw naw yuh don he said yuh don know when yuh done said ernuff but ahma teach yuh ternight he was up the steps and across the porch with one bound she backed into the hall her eyes full on his face tell me when yuh gonna stop talkin he said swinging his fist the blow caught her high on the cheek her eyes went blank she fell flat on her face she felt the hard heel of his wet shoes coming into her temple and stomach lemme hear yuh talk some mo she wanted to but could not pain numbed and choked her she lay still and somewhere out of the grey void of unconsciousness she heard someone say aw fer chrissakes leave her erlone its the nigger we wan    she never knew how long she had lain huddled in the dark hallway her first returning feeling was of a nameless fear crowding the inside of her then a deep pain spreading from her temple downward over her body her ears were filled with the drone of rain and she shuddered from the cold wind blowing through the door she opened her eyes and at first saw nothing as if she were imagining it she knew she was halflying and halfsitting in a corner against a wall with difficulty she twisted her neck and what she saw made her hold her breatha vast white blur was suspended directly above her for a moment she could not tell if her fear was from the blur or if the blur was from her fear gradually the blur resolved itself into a huge white face that slowly filled her vision she was stone still conscious really of the effort to breathe feeling somehow that she existed only by the mercy of that white face she had seen it before its fear had gripped her many times it had for her the fear of all the white faces she had ever seen in her life sue  as from a great distance she heard her name being called she was regaining consciousness now but the fear was coming with her she looked into the face of a white man wanting to scream out for him to go yet accepting his presence because she felt she had to though some remote part of her mind was active her limbs were powerless it was as if an invisible knife had split her in two leaving one half of her lying there helpless while the other half shrank in dread from a forgotten but familiar enemy sue its me sue its me    then all at once the voice came clearly sue its me its booker and she heard an answering voice speaking inside of her yeah its booker    the one wuht jus joined    she roused herself struggling for full consciousness and as she did so she transferred to the person of booker the nameless fear she felt it seemed that booker towered above her as a challenge to her right to exist upon the earth yuh awright she did not answer she started violently to her feet and fell sue yuh hurt yeah she breathed where they hit yuh its mah head she whispered she was speaking even though she did not want to the fear that had hold of her compelled her they beat yuh yeah them bastards them gawddam bastards she heard him saying it over and over then she felt herself being lifted naw she gasped ahma take yuh t the kitchen put me down but yuh cant stay here like this she shrank in his arms and pushed her hands against his body when she was in the kitchen she freed herself sank into a chair and held tightly to its back she looked wonderingly at booker there was nothing about him that should frighten her so but even that did not ease her tension she saw him go to the water bucket wet his handkerchief wring it and offer it to her distrustfully she stared at the damp cloth here put this on yo fohead   naw cmon itll make yuh feel bettah she hesitated in confusion what right had she to be afraid when someone was acting as kindly as this toward her reluctantly she leaned forward and pressed the damp cloth to her head it helped with each passing minute she was catching hold of herself yet wondering why she felt as she did whut happened ah don now yuh feel bettah yeah who all wuz here ah don know she said again yo head still hurt yeah gee ahm sorry ahm awright she sighed and buried her face in her hands she felt him touch her shoulder sue ah got some bad news fer yuh    she knew she stiffened and grew cold it had happened she stared dryeyed with compressed lips its mah johnnyboy she said yeah ahm awful sorry t hafta tell yuh this way but ah thought yuh oughta know    her tension eased and a vacant place opened up inside of her a voice whispered jesus help me wwwhere is he they got im out t foleys woods trying t make im tell who the others is he ain gonna tell she said they just as waal kill im cause he ain gonna tell ah hope he don said booker but he didnt hava chance t tell the others they grabbed im just as he got t the woods then all the horror of it flashed upon her she saw flung out over the rainy countryside an array of shacks where white and black comrades were sleeping in the morning they would be rising and going to lems then they would be caught and that meant terror prison and death the comrades would have to be told she would have to tell them she could not entrust johhnyboys work to another and especially not to booker as long as she felt toward him as she did gripping the bottom of the chair with both hands she tried to rise the room blurred and she swayed she found herself resting in bookers arms lemme go sue yuh too weak t walk ah gotta tell em she said set down sue yuh hurt yuh sick when seated she looked at him helplessly sue listen johnnyboys caught ahm here yuh tell me who they is n ahll tell em she stared at the floor and did not answer yes she was too weak to go there was no way for her to tramp all those miles through the rain tonight but should she tell booker if only she had somebody like reva to talk to she did not want to decide alone she must make no mistake about this she felt bookers fingers pressing on her arm and it was as though the white mountain was pushing her to the edge of a sheer height she again exclaimed inwardly jesus hep me bookers white face was at her side waiting would she be doing right to tell him suppose she did not tell and then the comrades were caught she could not ever forgive herself for doing a thing like that but maybe she was wrong maybe her fear was what johnnyboy had always called jus foolishness she remembered his saying ma we cant make the party grow ef we start doubtin everbody    tell me who they is sue n ahll tell em ah jus joined n ah don know who they is ah don know who they is she said yuh gotta tell me who they is sue ah tol yuh ah don know yuh do know c mon set up n talk naw yuh wan

is it green yeah murphy lawd ah don know yuh gotta tell me sue mistah booker please leave me erlone    is it murphy she answered yes to the names of johnnyboys comrades she answered until he asked her no more then she thought how he know the sheriffs men is watchin lems house she stood up and held onto her chair feeling something sure and firm within her how yuh know bout lem why    how ah know whut yuh doin here this tima night how yuh know the sheriff got johnnyboy sue don yuh believe in me she did not but she could not answer she stared at him until her lips hung open she was searching deep within herself for certainty you meet reva she asked reva  yeah lems gal oh yeah sho ah met reva she tell yuh she asked the question more of herself than of him she longed to believe yeah he said softly ah reckon ah oughta be going t tell em now who she asked tell whot the muscles of her body were stiff as she waited for his answer she felt as though life depended upon it the comrades he said yeah she sighed she did not know when he left she was not looking or listening she just suddenly saw the room empty and from her the thing that had made her fearful was gone v for a space of time that seemed to her as long as she had been upon the earth she sat huddled over the cold stove one minute she would say to herself they both gone now johnnyboy n sug    maybe ahll never see em ergin then a surge of guilt would blot out her longing lawd ah shouldna tol she mumbled but no man kin be so lowdown as t do a think like tha    several times she had an impulse to try to tell the comrades herself she was feeling a little better now but what good would that do she had told booker the names he jus couldnt be a judas t po folks like us    he couldnt an sue thas reva her heart leaped with an anxious gladness she rose without answering and limped down the dark hallway through the open door against the background of rain she saw revas face lit now and then to whiteness by the whirling beams of the beacon she was about to call but a thought checked her jesus hep me ah gotta tell her bout johnnyboy    lawd ah cant an sue yuh there c mon in chile she caught reva and held her close for a moment without speaking lawd ahm sho glad yuh here she said at last ah thought somethin had happened t yuh said reva pulling away ah saw the do open  pa tol me to come back n stay wid yuh tonight

silent while reva dressed her scalp she was feeling better now in just a little while she would tell reva she felt the girls finger pressing gently upon her head tha hurt a  chile yuh po thing it ain

stop naw ah cant carry on way in fronta reva    right now she had a deep need for reva to believe in her she watched the girl get pineknots from behind the stove rekindle the fire and put on the coffee pot yuh wan some cawffee reva asked naw honey aw c mon an sue jusa lil honey thas the way to be oh say ah fergot said reva measuring out spoonsful of coffee pa tol me t tell yuh t watch out fer that booker man hes a stool she showed not one sign of outward movement or expression but as the words fell from revas lips she went limp inside pa tol me soon as ah got back home he got word from town    she stopped listening she felt as though she had been slapped to the extreme outer edge of life into a cold darkness she knew now what she had felt when she had looked up out of her fog of pain and had seen booker it was the image of all the white folks and the fear that went with them that she had seen and felt during her lifetime and again for the second time that night something she had felt had come true all she could say to herself was ah didnt like im gawd knows ah didnt ah tol johnnyboy it wuz some of them white folks    here drink yo cawffee    she took the cup her fingers trembled and the steaming liquid spilt onto her dress and leg ahm sorry an sue her leg was scalded but the pain did not bother her its awright she said wait lemme put some lard on tha bum it don hurt yuh worried bout somethin naw honey lemme fix yuh so mo cawffee ah don wan nothin now reva waal buck up don be tha way  they were silent she heard reva drinking no she would not tell reva reva was all she had left but she had to do something some way somehow she was undone too much as it was and to tell reva about booker or johnnyboy was more than she was equal to it would be too coldly shameful she wanted to be alone and fight this thing out with herself go t bed honey yuh tired naw ahm awright an sue she heard the bottom of revas empty cup clank against the top of the stove ah got t make her go t bed yes booker would tell the names of the comrades to the sheriff if she could only stop him some way that was the answer the point the star that grew bright in the morning of new hope soon maybe half an hour from now booker would reach foleys woods hes boun t go the long way cause he don know no short cut she thought ah could wade the creek n beat im there    but what would she do after that reva honey go t bed ahm awright yuh need res ah ain sleepy an sue ah knows whuts bes fer yuh chile yuh tired n wet ah wanna stay up wid yuh she forced a smile and said ah don think they gonna hurt johnnyboy    ah ain sleepy an sue sho honey but ah wanna wait up wid yuh thas mah job honey thas whut a mas fer t wait up fer her chullun good night an sue she watched reva pull up and leave the kitchen presently she heard the shucks in the mattress whispering and she knew that reva had gone to bed she was alone through the cracks of the stove she saw the fire dying to grey ashes the room was growing cold again the yellow beacon continued to flit past the window and the rain still drummed yes she was alone she had done this awful thing alone she must find some way out alone like touching a festering sore she put her fingers upon that moment when she had shouted her defiance to the sheriff when she had shouted to feel her strength she had lost sug to save others she had let johnnyboy go to save others and then in a moment of weakness that came from too  much strength she had lost all if she had not shouted to the sheriff she would have been strong enough to have resisted booker she would have been able to tell the comrades herself something tightened in her as she remembered and understood the fit of fear she had felt on coming to herself in the dark hallway a part of her life she thought she had done away with forever had had hold of her then she had thought the soft warm past was over she had thought that it did not mean much when now she sang hes the lily of the valley the bright n mawnin star    the days when she had sung that song were the days when she had not hoped for anything on this earth the days when the cold mountain had driven her into the arms of jesus she had thought that sug and johnnyboy had taught her to forget him to fix her hope upon the fight of black men for freedom through the gradual years she had believed and worked with them had felt strength shed from the grace of their terrible vision that grace had been upon her when she had let the sheriff slap her down it had been upon her when she had risen time and again from the floor and faced him but she had trapped herself with her own hunger to water the long dry thirst of her faith her pride had made a bargain which her flesh could not keep her having told the names of johnnyboys comrades was but an incident in a deeper horror she stood up and looked at the floor while call and countercall loyalty and counterloyalty struggled in her soul mired she was between two abandoned worlds living but dying without the strength of the grace that either gave the clearer she felt it the fuller did something well up from the depths of her for release the more urgent did she feel the need to fling into her black sky another star another hope one more terrible vision to give her strength to live and act softly and restlessly she walked about the kitchen feeling herself naked against the night the rain the world and shamed whenever the thought of revas love crossed her mind she lifted her empty hands and looked at her writhing fingers lawd whut kin ah do now she could still wade the creek and get to foleys woods before booker and then what how could she manage to see johnnyboy or booker again she heard the sheriffs threatening voice git yuh a sheet cause hes gonna

heaven ahma go lika nigger woman wid mah windin sheet t git mah dead son but then what she stood straight and smiled grimly she had in her heart the whole meaning of her life her entire personality was poised on the brink of a total act ah know ah know she thought of johnny boys gun in the dresser drawer ahll hide the gun in the sheet n go aftah johnnyboys body    she tiptoed to her room eased out the dresser drawer and got a sheet reva was sleeping the darkness was filled with her quiet breathing she groped in the drawer and found the gun she wound the gun in the sheet and held them both under her apron then she stole to the bedside and watched reva lawd hep her but mabbe shes bettah off this had t happen sometimes    she n johnnyboy couldna been together in this here south    n ah couldnt tell her bout booker itll come out awright n she wont evah know revas trust would never be shaken she caught her breath as the shucks in the mattress rustled dryly then all was quiet and she breathed easily again she tiptoed to the door down the hall and stood on the porch above her the yellow beacon whirled through the rain she went over muddy ground mounted a slope stopped and looked back at her house the lamp glowed in her window and the yellow beacon that swung every few seconds seemed to feed it with light she turned and started across the fields holding the gun and sheet tightly thinking po reva    po critter    shes fas ersleep    vi for the most part she walked with her eyes half shut her lips tightly compressed leaning her body against the wind and the driving rain feeling the pistol in the sheet sagging cold and heavy in her fingers already she was getting wet it seemed that her feet found every puddle of water that stood between the corn rows she came to the edge of the creek and paused wondering at what point was it low taking the sheet from under her apron she wrapped the gun in it so that her fingers could be upon the trigger ahll cross here she thought at first she did not feel the water her feet were already wet but the water grew cold as it came up to her knees she gasped when it reached her waist lawd this creeks high when she had passed the middle she knew that she was out of danger she came out of the water climbed a grassy hill walked on turned a bend and saw the lights of autos gleaming ahead yeah theys still there she hurried with her head down wondah did ah beat im here lawd ah hope so a vivid image of bookers white face hovered a moment before her eyes and a surging will rose up in her so hard and strong that it vanished

they led her to a muddy clearing the rain streamed down through the ghostly glare of the flashlights as the men formed a semicircle she saw johnnyboy lying in a trougn of mud he was tied with rope he lay hunched and one side of his face rested in a pool of black water his eyes were staring questioningly at her speak t im said the sheriff if she could only tell him why she was here but that was

placed his palm over the other ear and struck again johnnyboy moaned his head rolling from side to side his eyes showing white amazement in a world without sound yuh wouldnt talk t im when yuh had the chance said the sheriff try n talk now she felt warm tears on her cheeks she longed to shoot johnnyboy and let him go but if she did that they would take the gun from her and booker would tell who the

fired once then without pausing she turned hearing them yell she aimed at johnnyboy but they had their arms around her bearing her to the ground clawing at the sheet in her hand she glimpsed booker lying sprawled in the mud on his face his hands stretched out before him then a cluster of yelling men blotted him out she lay without struggling looking upward through the rain at the white faces

her flesh growing cold cold as the rain that fell from the invisible sky upon the doomed living and the dead that never dies
i am still inclined to see richard wright through the haze of popularfront nostalgia which i attach to many of the public phenomena of my nineteenthirties childhood i was only seven years old when native son was published in  but it seems to me i can recall the warm reassurance with which it was received then by the middleclass jewish circles in brooklyn amidst which i was growing up i responded to the book in the same way when i finally read it in  during the height of the civilrights eraanother kind of popularfront somewhat surprised to discover that its hero was a murderer i nevertheless felt that by the books end wright had more or less come back to making his peace with the family feeling against which bigger thomas had been defined that he was returning home to the liberalradical brotherhood of white and black after his fling at delinquency even while continuing to mutter sullen protests under his breath for this home was the one place i had assumed on the basis of wrights essay in the god that failed the only other work of his id read at the time that provided the atmosphere of human solidarity which enabled him to create and i supposed that it was nothing but the steadily growing corruption and relentless absolutism of the household that could have caused him to leave it as he eventually did my view was founded of course in a family pride that was extreme even though i myself had never been anything more radical than some kind of social democrat i think that if one goes deep enough one can find in the heart of every european marxist who was born a jew the notion that his jewishness somehow provides a paradigm for the condition of the proletariat so also is a similar conception of the lot of the negro probably to  be found in the hearts of most american jewish intellectuals this is simply a revolutionaryage variant of the jews traditional presumption about himself being the elder brother to all men in suffering and in perceiving glimmers of the apocalypse at the brooklyn high school i attended in the late nineteenforties for example where the vast majority of the students were jewish and liberal there was a negro in the class ahead of me there were perhaps three or four negro students in the whole school who brilliant student that he was was lionized to such a degree that he almost became a public property we perceived him as if we were looking at ourselves in a dark mirror and he responded with a lifestyle that seemed to be an enhanced version of any of our own richard wright must have experienced something like this befriended surrounded advised and admonished by warmly admiring jewish artists and intellectuals from the moment he joined the communist party in  to the t me he left it in  bringing away with him the jewish wife he had found in its midst his life could easily have been viewed in the dark mirror by those jewish radicals who wished to do so born in the shtetl natchez mississippi in  he emigrated to the american urban ghetto chicagos south c side in his voung manhood began his selfeducation as a writer and intellectual by reading such  authors as h l mencken and received his higher education in the john reed club and the communist party it was according to wrights account in the god that failed a jewish writer named sol who first steered him to the chicago john reed club where he was introduced to a jewish boy who was to become one of the nations leading painters ben shahn according to wrights biographer constance webb to a chao who was to become one of the eminent composers of his day to a writer who was to create some of the best novels of his generation nelson algren again according to constance webb to a young jewish boy who was destined to film the nazi occupation of czechoslovakia the euphoria of fimes suc h as these could not have been easily forgotten and even in native son when wright is struggling to throw off the mantle of the communist brotherhood bigger thomas significantly achieves the only genuinely human relationshios with whites he has ever known through the friendship of two jewish communists the old lawyer max who tries to defend him against the death sentence and jan ehone modeled as constance webb tells us after a canadian jew named jan wittenber of whom wright had said that he alone erlone in the dialect of the southern negroes of wrights stories among the chicago comrades had shown a depth and richness of human understanding toward him that went beyond mere ideology wright responded loyally at first to the requirements of the brotherhood that had taken him in and given him his start as a writer and intellectual starting out as a poet he contributed to party journals such orthodox statements as this one published in the new masses in  i am black and i have seen black hands raised in fists of revolt side by side with the white fists of white workers and some dayand it is only this which sustains me some day there shall be millions and millions of them on some red day in a burst of fists on a new horizon the image of the negro contained in this leftwhitmanesque vision is ultimately that of the supreme negro ideal of the epoch paul robeson singing the ballad for americans sleeves rolled up the black worker standing alongside the white worker fists clenched in anger at a common injustice as with many elements of the communist orthodoxy there was a thin and tortuous line that had to be walked in order to keep the purity of this vision intact the party strove to make the negro cause its ownultimately this was a european mythology trying to impose itself upon an american conditionand wright by  the designated chief negro spokesman for the movements literary wing was assigned the delicate task of finding a black literary credo that would provide a more authentic voice for the negro masses than either the essentially bourgeoisassimilationist writings of the talented tenth had done prior to the first world war or the cutely folkloric works of the harlem school had achieved in the twenties but that would not veer over on the other hand into the excesses of negro nationalism such a credo was formulated in his essay blueprint for negro writing published in the fall  issue of the partys shortlived negro literary journal new challenge which wright edited but it was one thing to theorize about such a negro literature and another thing entirely to practice it i have seen black hands may have satisfied the party hierarchy as an example of what to do but it could hardly suffice for a serious writer where was wright to find his own literary identity he evidently had his first intimation of an answer to this question in the fall of  when he published an article in the new masses on joe louis knockout victory over max baer a jew incidentally for the world heavyweight championship in it the author of i have seen black hands commits the heresy of seeing for a moment the black fists alone entitled joe louis uncovers dynamite the article is entirely a description of the brief but violent outburst of rioting that took place in chicagos south side ghetto in the wake of louis victory for a fleeting instant it was black against white a confrontation founded in hostilities far deeper than those superficially contained in the question hurled at white passersby who yuh fer baer or louis a taxicab driver had his cab wrecked when he tried to put up a show of bravado in the face of this question storekeepers wright says gazed out their windows at the demonstrators in fear and with blanched faces inspired by louis example the rioters seemed to be saying we aint scared either well fight too when the time comes well win too wright does not hesitate to append his own enthusiasm to his description of the scene really he writes there was a religious feeling in the air well it wasnt exactly a religious feeling but it was something and you could feel it it was a feeling of unity of oneness and then later something had popped loose all right and it had come from deep down out of the darkness it had leaped from its coil and nobody could have said just what it was and nobody wanted to say blacks and whites were afraid but it was a sweet fear at least for the blacks it was a mingling of fear and fulfillment    four centuries of oppression were rising to the surface the separatist implications of these remarks could not have struck communist sensibilities lightly and it is significant that the editors of the new masses saw fit to place at the head of the article a brief preface that sought to smooth over some of its ideological rough spots something of the same emotional release the editors granted occurs whenever a negro triumphs in competition with a white person but from this they moved on quickly to a reassertion of the orthodox view of the negros role in the revolution the communist party consisting of negroes as well as whites has made valiant beginningsthe scottsboro defense the demonstrations against italian fascism and in scores of other instances it was perhaps as a concession to this view that wright concluded his article by saying say comrade heres a wild river thats got to be harnessed and directed but the river released by this episode in wrights own spirit was not to be so easily harnessed his first major short story big boy leaves home published a few months after this article is a further inquiry into the nature of that dynamite uncovered by joe louis knockout blow it anticipates native son not only in the similarity of its protagonists name to that of bigger thomas but in the central act of the story big boys murder of a white man this act is committed in selfdefense just as biggers killing of the white girl is an accidental outcome of a defensive reflex but big boy like bigger after him implicitly accepts complete responsibility for it partly because he is a negro and the white society will accept no mitigating circumstances in his killing of a white person and partly because this inadvertent act has suddenly become something which defines him and enables him to transcend his old life situation at the end of the story big boy is riding in the back of a truck escaping to the north leaving behind him his past and all its limitations this individual course of transcendence and selfemancipation struck out upon in an ultimate gesture of opposition to the white man is the threatening heresy to the communist worldview that wright is about to pursue in his subsequent works of fiction but this is still only at its beginning point the story must have looked orthodox enough to any communist reader containing as it does so many welldrawn elements of the communist vision of the negro an impoverished southern setting a lynching scene and above all a depiction of spontaneous folksolidarity as big boys family and neighbors rally around to help him escape in a manner true to the marxian stress on objectivity wright has chosen a purely external narrative style for this story depicting only acts and circumstances and using pure dialogue through more than twothirds of its length the thoroughly unmarxist subjective focus of native son showing bigger thomas existential sense of mounting liberation and transcendence is entirely missing here this is also the case with his next two major stories which nevertheless continue to explore wrights preoccupation with a vision that centers in his fiction upon the murder of a white man by a negro in both stories the impact of this vision is softened by a pure rarely internalized narrative style and also by the thoroughly mitigating circumstances within which the murder is committed each time mann in down by the riversidesurely the noblest most robesonesque figure of a black man wright ever created has been trapped at home with his pregnant wife by a mississippi flood bringing her to a hospital in a boat borrowed from someone who has stolen it from a white man he encounters its enraged owner who begins shooting at him and whom he kills in selfdefense later after his wife has died and he has been mustered into doing rescue work he willingly saves the life of the daughter of the man he has killed upon their return to dry land she points him out as her fathers murderer and he is shot down by the mob silas in long black song who has been saving his meager earnings for years with the hope of obtaining complete ownership of his farm some day comes home one afternoon to discover that his wife has been raped by a white salesman when the salesman returns the next day silas kills him and then sending his wife and child away to safety he remains to shoot it out with the lynch mob that comes for him ultimately the house is burned to the ground with him inside it in all these three stories the killing at the pivotal point in the narrative is still susceptible of being viewed as the thoroughly provoked uprising of an enraged proletariat an act of solidarity with oppressed workers everywhere white or black when they were assembled and placed alongside fire and cloud the nearest thing to a communist propaganda tract in fiction that wright ever produced in the  edition of uncle toms childrenwrights first bookthey did not seem out of place all four stories dealt with southern negroes and were therebv thematicallv connected fur   thermore together they suggest that wright had not yet arrived at a firm resolution in his pursuit of the vision that had been disturbing him at least since the rioting over joe louis victory in the fall of  for fire and cloud does seem seriously to offer the communist brotherhood as an alternative to some ultimate act of violence as a way for wright to depict a negro achieving full selfrealization in his relations with white men  it is only in a fifth story bright and morning star written after the first edition of uncle toms children had gone to press but included in the  edition of the book that wright shows clear signs of his coming definitive break with the communist alternative the story begins in a kind of communist euphoria showing a southern negro widow whose two sons have become active in the movement and whose satisfaction with the clandestine life of blackandwhite brotherhood that they have brought her is not diminished by the fact that one of them is in jail for his activities but this idyll is broken by a white informer who has made his way into the movement and into the widows confidence she discovers his identity only after she has given him a list of local party members and after her second son has been captured by a white mob while out trying to warn his comrades of the danger here wright uses a story that as he tells us in black boy he had heard and been profoundly impressed by as a boy in mississippi hiding a gun under a sheet the widow goes forth to where her son is being beaten to death by the mob telling them the sheet is for her sons burial when the informer arrivesshe has gotten there ahead of him by taking a shortcutshe shoots him before he can utter the names of her comrades in the party she is then killed by the mob along with her son for the first time in wrights  stories the narrative becomes profoundly subjective in focus her whole being leaped with a will it says at the moment she decides upon her final course of action the long years of her life bent toward a moment of focus a point    she had in her heart the whole meaning of her life her entire personality was poised on the brink of a total act this was the realization wright had been groping for all along here fully articulated for the first time and arrived at in a moment of betrayal if not by the communist movement at least by the widows blind faith in it significantly it seems to have been the negro leader benjamin dvis who alone among the party leadership spotted the heresy lurking within this story wright now felt that he knew clearly what he wanted and realized that in all his stories so far he had erred in the direction of sentimentahv when the reviews of uncle toms children began to appear he later wrote in an essay describing the genesis of native son i realized that i had made an awfully naive mistake i found that i had written a book which even bankers daughters could read and weep over and feel good about constance webb tells us that wright began feeling this way after he had received a letter from mrs franklin d roosevelt saying that the book was beautifully written and so vivid that i had a most unhappy time reading it and so now i swore to myself that if i ever wrote another book no one would weep over it that it would be so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears this time there would be no mitigating circumstancesat least not too many surrounding the outburst of black dynamite the result not of one or another immediate provocation but of those four centuries of oppression in a way how bigger was born published in pamphlet form shortly after the appearance of native son is more insistent than the novel is about a reversion to the primitive right of anger describing the various bigger thomass he had known wright often presents someone who goes beyond his novels protagonist in sheer toughness of skin such as this one discovered sitting in the white section of a jim crow streetcar in the south pride and the streetcar moved on its journey without incident this passage seems to be moving toward a vicariousness not unlike that of the boy who sends his big brother out after the block bully a few pages later angrily denouncing the white liberalism of such institutions as the south side boys club where he once worked wright tells how id say to myself    go to it boys prove to the bastards that gave you these games that life is stronger than pingpong    they did the police blotters of chicago are testimony to how much they did that was the only way i could contain myself for doing a job i hated for a moment id allow myself vicariously to feel as bigger feltnot much just a little just a littlebut still there it was there it was indeed wright was experiencing a prophetic vision of the black ghettos in revolt but what response to this was he seeing in himself ralph ellison has said that he found it disturbing that bigger thomas had none of the finer qualities of richard wright none of the imagination none of the sense of poetry none of the gaiety these were precisely the qualities that wright evidently wanted to strip away in his definitive examination of the meanings of a form of response that he seemed to have glimpsedand to have experienced only vicariously then and ever afterwardson that night in chicago in  following joe  louis victory over max baer and it was precisely his quality of imagination which enabled him to create an unimaginative character so unlike himself in order to enact this vicarious realization indeed in native son wright almost succeeds in achieving the imaginative liberation he sought by writing it the book eventually runs aground in the authors own intellectuality a quality which for the novels sake he had succeeded in suppressing both too well and not well enough the first twothirds of native son constitute one of the most exciting stretches of melodrama in american literature bigger thomas is hired as a chauffeur by the millionaire dalton a man who maintains his fortune by owning such ratinfested tenements as the one bigger lives in and who eases his conscience by such acts as sending pingpong tables to the south side boys club or hiring negro servants with the intention of helping them to complete their education his first night on the job bigger is assigned to drive daltons twentyyearold daughter mary to an evening class at the university of chicago but she instead directs him to a spot at which they pick up marys boy friend jan erlone a communist the two young whites sit in the front seat with bigger and persuade him to show them around the south side but their protestations of friendship and concern with the plight of the negro succeed only in filling big ger with confusion fear and resentment at the end of the evening after jan has been dropped off bigger discovers to his terror that mary is too drunk to get up to her room without his help filled with apprehension he brings her upstairs and has just stretched her out on the bed when marys mother aroused from her sleep appears at the door of the room mrs dalton is blind and bigger horrified at the prospect of being found in a situation which has traditionally meant death for the black man presses a pillow over the semiconscious marys face to keep her from crying out after mrs dalton leaves bigger discovers that he has killed mary this is the moment when he is transformed until now most of the acts of his life including his accidental killing of mary had been motivated by the fear into which oppression had driven him now suddenly his whole existence had become the determination of his own free and transcendent will released from its lifelong bondage by this single act though he had killed by accident not once did he feel the need to tell himself that it had been an accident he was black and he had been alone in a room where a white girl had been killed therefore he had killed her that was what everybody would say anyhow no matter what he said and in a certain sense he knew that the girls death had not been accidental he had killed many times before only on these other times there had been no handy victim or circumstance to make visible or dramatic his will to kill his crime seemed natural he felt that all of his life had been leading to something like this it was no longer a matter of dumb wonder as to what would happen to him and his black skin he knew now the hidden meaning of his lifea meaning which others did not see and which he had always tried to hidehad spilled out from this moment until biggers capture by the police on a snowcovered tenement rooftop some two hundred pages later the novel is pure movement the kind of overwhelming narrative torrent that wright had already made into a trademark in a story like down by the riverside in native son this narrative flow serves the additional function of showing what has happened to biggers existence every one of his acts now in contrast with the torpor that had prevailed in the descriptions of his life prior to the murder of mary dalton is swift vigorous and meaningful another element in a headlong process of selfdefinition wright spares no horror in this unfolding of the hidden meaning of his protagonists existence biggers ultimate and most completely unforgivable act of violent selfassertion is his murder of his mistress bessie with whom he has shared his secret and whose life has therefore become intolerable to him according to constance webb wright wanted to include this episode in the novel so that there would be no mistaking biggers stark responsibility for his acts no catering to the sensibilities of bankers daughters in retrospect it seems also to be another of the novels prophetic glimpses of the ghetto revolt of the sixties ultimately turning against itself and burning down homes with black women and children inside this then is the culminating act of biggers selfemancipating revolt his one unequivocally wilful act of annihilationperformed upon a poor black workinggirl did wright mean for the irony to read this way is it an intended qualification to his vision of a black revolutionary apocalypse or an inadvertent prophecy miss webb does not tell us but this much must be said if this is ultimately the outcome of biggers revolt then it is not so likely to disturb the sensibilities of bankers daughters after all the last third of the novel dealing with biggers imprisonment and trial is wrights final bout with the communist worldview and the narrative moves slowly and indecisively again wright is more or less victorious this i have come to feel since  but he wins only narrowly by a decision rather than with a joe louis knockout blow he seems to want to give what he can back to the communists after the heresy he has committed in the first twothirds of the book it is only they for example who show compassion and some understanding towards bigger and he is deeply appreciative of this despite his  refusal to be categorized by them as a mere phenomenon of the oppressed part of mankind i didnt want to kill but what i killed for i am he defiandy tells the communist lawyer to the latters horror jan erlone whose girl friend bigger has murdered and upon whom he had tried to shift the blame for the crime is the very soul of forgiveness the old lawyer max tries to defend bigger from the death sentence in a long courtroom summation indicting societys injustices max is even able to see beneath the blanket of communist myth the more unruly revolutionary force that bigger represents kill this boy he tells the court and makes thousands of other black men and women feel that the barriers are tighter and higher kill him and swell the tide of pentup lava that will some day break loose not in a single blundering accidental individual crime but in a wild cataract of emotion that will brook no control but ultimately it is max who comes forth not only in the courtroom but within wrights internal moral dialectic as the last defender of the old vision of a coalition of the oppressed  bigger dont you know they hate others too who they hate they hate trade unions they hate folks who try to organize    but they hate black folks more than they hate unions bigger said they dont treat union folks like they do me oh yes they do you think that because your color makes it easier for them to point you out segregate you exploit you but they do that to others too they hate me because im trying to help you theyre writing me letters calling me a dirty jew  it seems to me that this passage is demonstrative of wrights ambivalence about the clean break he is here trying to make with the vision represented by communism today we can see as clearly through some of maxs nineteenthirties myths as wright was doing then they certainly do hate black folks more than they hate unions furthermore in america they hate negroes more than they hate jews but europe in  was something else again jews had already been made into the negroes of nazi germany as an overture to mass slaughter wright was undoubtedly sensitive to this as he always was to a european perspective upon things indeed this sensitivity was communisms permanent legacy to him for he had no sooner broken a few years after this with the essentially european mythsystem that communism represented than he went to europe and absorbed a new set of its myths to explain the world the spirit of max partly consumed in a european nostalgia shared by every american jewish intellectual was never completely exorcised by wright he had absorbed this nostalgia as part of his education and his vision of black revolt was as blurred by it as his pursuit of the vision was spurred by a passion to shake it off this is the meaning of biggers final but somehow inconclusive show of defiance before max in his death cell ending with a faint wry bitter smile through the bars as the lawyer walks down the corridor here is the way wrights revolt ends not with a bang but a smirk ralph ellison has pointed out the basic ambiguity of native son wherein in order to translate biggers complicated feelings into universal ideas wright had to force into biggers consciousness concepts and ideas which his intellect could not formulate between wrights skill and knowledge and the potentials of biggers mute feelings lay a thousand years of conscious culture in his search after a certain notion of the primitive wright had come dangerously close to creating a character who was a mere vehicle for ideas bigger still works despite the ambiguity but wrights growing preoccupation with the metaphysics of blackness turned many of the characters he subsequently created into hardly more than metaphors constance webb tells us that in the years immediately following the publication of native sonthe war years wright completed another lengthy manuscript for a novel about a woman who whitened her skin by taking arsenic wafers orally which was never published even though its author was now famous wright also published a long short story in this period the man who lived underground which is about a negro who escaping from a false murder charge takes refuge in a sewer from there he sees numerous vignettes of the life of the city through cellar openings and holes in walls it is an interesting attempt to use blackness as a metaphor for the condition known in jewish literature as that of one who sees but is not seen but the ideaoriginally inspired by a reading of dostoyevskyis more appealing than the realization is successful and it was eventually to be used to much better effect bv ralph ellison with whom wright apparently often discussed its mplications black boy published in  wrights first book to appear in the five years since native sonis his masterpiece and yet it would seem from miss webbs narrative that it was written almost inadvertently after wrights agent surprised him by suggesting that he try an autobiography persuaded to drop the mantle of a writer of fiction for a moment although he uses the techniques of the novel here most effectively wright has recourse in this book to telling it like it is without drawing upon his arsenal of symbolism and melodramatic plotmaking a simple and powerful account of his boyhood and young manhood in the south it is his one booklength narrative that does not border on solipsism but contains a whole array of real characterizations  even the whites that appear almost all of them as persecutors are more real and hence human than such caricatures as dalton or the private detective in native son focusing more resolutely on real experience than he had ever done before wright had lighted upon conventions that were for the first time entirely his own evoking as ellison says the paradoxical almost surreal image of a black boy singing the blues lustily as he probes his own grievous wound the book suggests possibilities for a whole genre of negro writing signs of which we are now beginning to see today but in wrights own life and work black boy proved to be the swan song of his struggle to achieve his own identity as a writer and a man in america in the latter half of  he visited france as the guest of its government and in the summer of the following year he brought his wife and fiveyearold daughter to paris to settle there for good having found life as a negro in america intolerable enoush for himself he came to feel that he could not conceive of it for his daughter france had presented to him the prospect of an entirely different way of life he would be an outsider there too but more as an exiled american intellectual than as a negro although france is far from colorblind it is at any rate less colorconscious than almost any other western nation furthermore within that most remarkable of meltingpots the paris intelligentsiaby whom wright had been warmly received during his visithis color did not stand so much for a complex and burdensome ethnic fact as for a principle of sartrean authenticity it was a mere outward representation of some particular angle of vision within the universalist brotherhood of leftbank artists and intellectuals by merely trading in the lilt with which he once had sung the blues wright became eligible to put on the frenchmade mantle of negri tude whose graceful and classic lines obscured the homely contours of mississippi and chicago in other words his color became in france what he had always sought to make it a kind of metaphor this transmutation is reflected in wrights next book the outsider published in  his first in eight years it is a novel laden with language and concepts borrowed from french existentialism discussions of bad faith a title from camus letranger better known in english as the stranger can also be translated the outsider even a district attorney who says to the protagonist that he has committed the greatest crime of all because you didnt bat your eye when i told you that your mother was dead cross damon a new variant of bigger thomas perceived through the french philosophical sensibility commits a series of murders that read like ritual metaphors for the series of rejections wright had made in his own life damon begins by murdering himself as it were narrowly escaping with his life from a chicago train accident he discovers that another passenger who was killed has been mistaken for him and he decides to accept this going later to watch his own funeral from a distance then damon is recognized by a friend whom he encounters by chance and he kills him rather than have to return to a life he had found intolerable he leaves his native chicago and goes to new york where under an assumed identity he becomes involved with communists a young communist couple gil blount ne bernstein and his wife eva take him in as a boarder in order to challenge the racist policies of their landlord enraged at the sight of a negro in his building the landlord gets into a fight with blount and damon when he discovers the two of them lying unconscious from each others blows finishes the job and kills them botha plague on both their houses the next day damon kills another communist who is suspicious of him and becomes the lover of blounts widow eva for an outsider sans identity any expression of his contempt for the worlds myths has been possible but now he shows one fatal weakness he falls in love with eva and is broken when she commits suicide after learning the truth about him this is his one display of humanity in the whole novel in the end it is not the law but the communists who destroy him shooting him down in the street the thrust of wrights work had now brought him to a point of extreme alienation his next novel savage holidaywhich appeared directly in a paperback edition because his regular publisher harper  brothers would not handle it is a suspense thriller about a retired white insurance executive who stepping out of the shower to pick up his newspaper in the hallway one sunday morning finds himself trapped there naked when his door accidentally slams shut caught naked in the hallwaythis is what had become of wrights creative metaphor of his very inner identity during the next few years wright made strenuous efforts to recover roots for a theme that had now become in literary terms a mere abstraction in  he visited the future republic of ghana as the guest of prime minister nkrumah and wrote a book about his observations under the prophetic title black_power continuing to pursue the possibilities of reportage as a literary outlet for himself he undertook two major journeys in pursuit of material during the summer and fall of  to spain and to the bandung conference as the title of his book pagan spain indicates his trip to that countrythe one country of the western world about which as though shunning the memory of a  bad love affair i did not until now want to exercise my mind was a recapitulation of his old question for a primitive reality behind the mask of communist myth pagan spain whose border with france marks the termination of europe and the beginning of africa was the dark truth that had reposed beneath the rightleft conventions of the spanish civil war era so also at the bandung conference did wright perceive an underlying realityformed out of race and religionthat was beyond left and right he was thus moving in the direction of what was in fact another leftwing myth that of the third worldwhich was being generated in france during this period it was a possible outcome of the logic of his own development in a sense bigger thomas could be viewed retrospectively as a representative of frantz fanons theories about the selfrealization of the colonized through violent revolt but this in the end would tend to make biaser as much a creature of jeanpaul sartres universe as the lawyer max had wanted to make him of the universe of american communism in the nineteenthirties wright did not seem content with this resolution either he had been very keenly aware for example of the gulf between himself and the black man of africa during his trip there the short time that now remained of his life was filled with what seems to have been a frantic struggle to recover his themes as he thrashed about through possibilities both old and new he tried writing again about the negro in the american south but the resulting novel the long dream published in  was severely criticized for its manifest remoteness from reality it was far more popular in france than in the united states his short stories mere fanciful creations were better because they were able to bear up somehow under the weight of being intellectual constructs a story published in  big black good man suggests the possibility that the course of wrights sensibility was seeking to come full circle it tells of an elderly hotel clerk in denmark who is terrified one night by an enormous black man who comes asking for a room and a prostitute the clerk becomes obsessed with this giant whose sexuality seems to be as overwhelming as his appearance as he fills his order night after night then one evening as if in fulfillment of a recurring nightmare the negro comes in and wraps his huge hands about the clerks throat but takes them away momentarily and leaves it is only after months in which the clerk has endless morbid fantasies about him that the negro returns to the hotel again beckons to the clerk andpresents him with some shirts in gratitude for services rendered the terrifying hands around the clerks neck had been estimating his shirt size the frightening guest was a big black good man after all does the similarity of name to those of big boy and bigger suggest what wright was trying to do it is one of his few stories displaying some of the sunniness and humor for which he was apparently well known in person was he making his peace at last and if so where was it to take him no one will ever know for he was dead three years later in the fall of  in the posthumous collection of richard wrights short stories that was published in  eight men the final piece called the man who went to chicago is not a work of fiction but a memoir an excerpt from the final and unpublished third of his manuscript for black boy it tells among other things of a brief period shortly after his arrival in chicago from the south when he held a job as a clerk in a delicatessen run by an elderly jewish couple the relations between them and himself that he describes are an odd mixture of decency and strained understanding his employers were kind but not always patient he for his own part guiltily remembered some of the antisemitic folklore of his childhood one day mrs hoffman asked him to go to a nearby store to pick up a can of cheek keen awr lar keeng utterly baffled he asked her to repeat this several times until she lost her temper crying dont you know nosing when he asked her to write it down she protested that she was unable to write finally he learned the syllables by rote went on his errand and was handed a can of chicken a la king muttering curses on the way back he reflected bitterly though english was my native tongue and america my native land she an alien could operate a store and earn a living in a neighborhood where i could not even live i reasoned further that she was aware of this and trying to protect her position against me shortly after that when the time came for a scheduled civil service exam he took off from work three days in a row to prepare for it and take it not wanting the hoffmans to know he was looking for another job he told them the next day that his mother had died and he had gone to memphis for the funeral but they did not believe him the more they refused to accept his story the more he persisted in it until mrs hoffman protested we treat you nice dont we his anger at them grew with his shame and at the end of the week when his civil service job came up he left them without even saying he would not be back the next day it was not until i had left the delicatessen job that i saw how grossly i had misread the motives and attitudes of mr hoffman and his wife i had not yet learned anything that would have helped me to thread my way through these perplexing racial relations accepting my environment at its face value trapped by my own emotions i kept asking myself what had black people done to bring this crazy world upon them i know the hoffmans because they are in a sense my parents and i too have rejected them werent they also the parents of jan erlone and the lawyer maxs cousins perhaps they were among the storekeepers who gazed out their windows with blanched faces at the rioters the night of joe louis victory over max baer a lot has happened since then and they are long since gone or going those elderly storekeepers some bearing the scars of their munderstandings others unreconciled but all all passing to the next generation a challenge with which it was difficult for them to cope has the time come to find peace in that legacy is this what wright was trying to come back to from the lonely exile into which that old strife had driven him
