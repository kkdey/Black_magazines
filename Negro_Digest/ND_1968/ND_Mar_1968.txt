nature nd needs of the ck ersity

evolutionary change for the liberation of a people from  oppressive social  structures is not the special function of one course of action but more likely the result of several and while education is generally hoped to be a liberating force on mens minds and bodies ofttimes it has been used as a debilitating tool in the interests of an oppressive society accordingly kwame nkrumah compares the colonial student educated for the art of forming not a concrete environmental view of social political problems but an abstract liberal outlook with the revolutionary student animated by a lively national consciousness who sought knowledge as an instrument of national emancipation and integrity so it is becoming rather clear that educational institutions are vital to a liberation movement a fact of negro digest march  modern times in anticolonial movements in the third world in the united states there is no question about the persistence of segregation racism and more subtle forms of neoracism as the pernicious oppression of racism is an organic part of the institutions symbols and values of western industrial society so it is firmly entrenched in the usa as american as apple pie an afro american liberation movement must subvert andor supplant such a wellentrenched social system if it is to be a real source of radical change and not a false one my primary task in this discussion is an ideological consideration of the role of a university in the liberation of the afroamerican community it must be clear that this role has to deal with todays world as well as with what ought to be and certainly it must include the management of whatever social change is required to move effectively from the is to the ought the university is alive for people in the world including all of the socioeconomic and political hangsup involved and so must meet the challenge of responding creatively to whatever needs exist now for those people but at the same time it must project itself as a prophetic institution calling into question all that which is inconsistent with its highest ideals and organizing its activities to bring about the realization of its ideals the focus of this discussion is on what ought to be the prophetic social role of the black university for therein lies the fountainhead of revolutionary liberation we must be reminded of this same theme as stated by dr w e b du bois over  years ago in the  niagro movement resolutions and when we call for education we mean real education    education is the development of power and ideal we want our  children trained as intelligent human beings should be and we will fight for all time against any proposal to educate black boys and girls simply as servants and underlings or simply for the use of other people they have a right to know to think to aspire we do not believe in violence    but we do believe in    that willingness to sacrifice money reputation and life itself on the altar of right the booker t washingtondu bois dialectical opposition is relevant here as it is the important example of the is versus the ought concerning educational ideology for afroamericans training people to fit in where they can think of mdta job corps etc might be acceptable for short term solutions though not as washington thought it to be but the educational ideology of du bois is our prophecy a rationale to built a black universitythe crucible of definitive social change in order that the idea of the new university and the notions of how we are to achieve it as a goal will be more clearly understood it is important to discuss briefly the current social situation the current situation is one charged with a great deal of expectancy on the part of many afroamericans an expectancy frequently expressed by the emotional connotations of a term or phrase but usually not delineated in structural or programmatic terms but this programmatic deficiency is not so much a shortcoming for the exciting search for innovation and relevance is the first sign of progress a major question then is what conditions give rise to this expectancy this charged atmosphere crystallized around the term black university a major trend in todays world is that as oppressed people know that the world offers more than they have and as they are able to get a little more of it they also expect to get very much more this has been called the revolution of rising expectations a figurative example an afroamerican family gets a television set and enters as a spectator the world of affluent euroamerican society it is not complicated to see that this would lead to the family wanting more than it has much more just imasine how cruel it must be for poor oppressed black people to watch the giveaway quiz programs on which white people win appliances furniture and cars in  minutes or so then think of a scene of ghetto destruction during which people brave armed police to steal appliances furniture and cars in  minutes or so oppressed people see what is going on and want in in the best way they can get in yes by any means necessary to do it right now along with this developing desire to get more out of society there also is the increasing saliency of a nationalistic alternative to the system the general components are militancy selfdetermination and a desire to identify with similar oppressed people throughout the world who are not by accident mostly colored people this alternative is grounded in communalism and finds its legitimacy from within afroamerica and not outside of it nationalism in this context means total concern for the community of common experience so afroamerican nationalism is grounded in the black experience communalism meaning selfhelp cooperative efforts is the ethic supporting the new alternative these two major trends cannot be viewed outside of the total context of world events especially those events of particular relevance to the afroamerican community the militaryindustrial machine of the western powers is equally offensive and outraging in vietnam and south africa in santo domingo and ghana but it seems apparent that peoples can only unite across the world in aspiring for the same universalspeace freedom and justicewhile focusing their working activities on the social ills as manifested at home if we are to reap a harvest of world brotherhood then each man must first tend to his own garden but for each garden to have its true meaning the gardener must know his historical role and his relationship with all others working for the same harvest the two trends are general social sources of the cry for a black university while everyone is more or less for such a thing as a university for some the quality of blackness imbues the concept with polemical emotional intensity and conceptual ambiguity or in extreme cases of racism this must be cleared up if the dialogue is to continue in reference to a university blackness must mean at least three things first blackness refers to the afroamerican community as the basic focus for the university this in no way compromises or limits its universalistic orientation or its attempts to contribute to human progress rather it frees it to be relevant in the face of an unmet need reflecting the woeful limit of human progress a second and more controversial point considers the limits placed on participation in the university blackness does not categorically exclude all white people from the university it redefines the standards for their participation and the possibility for their involvement in much the same way that independent african countries have attempted to redefine the possible role of the european so in the black university the role of the white man must be redefined and carefully placed for the maximum good of all some white people will be necessary for the immediate future if for no other reason than the  black communitys own shortage of resources but unconditional participation will have to be ended the participation must be based on a commitment to the goals and aspirations of the afroamerican community and the white participant must possess the sacrificial humility necessary for one historically and socially identified with the beast of afroamerican history and the system of oppression last blackness is an affirmation of an identity independent of the historical human evils of modern nation states and is closely tied to the emerging international identity of man in his struggle for a better life consider this revelation by brother malcolm_x when on his pilgrimage to mecca that morning was when i first began to reappraise the white man it was when i first began to perceive that white man as commonly used means complexion only secondarily primarily it described attitudes and actions in america white man meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man and toward all other nonwhite men but in the muslim world i had seen men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been the relations between people must be allowed to grow and progress without the limiting problem of the national state who are we afroamericans men of the world why are we here we were sent here to love where are we going toward the community of love and if stopped we will continue by any means necessary because we must continue so much for prologue what is the black university idea all about what are its goals and what might it look like the university focusing on the particular needs of the afroamerican community will be a center of learning but recognizing the alternatives noted above by nkrumah it must be based on an educational ideology grounded in an uncompromising goal of psychological independence from the oppressor and his oppressive system and as much structural independence as is necessary not only to survive in the world but to prosper so education must be defined to specify these purposes as most important the american usa ethic of individualism is inclusive of both basic needs of men and the essence of a social style all men are to some extent selfcentered but to build a social group process on selfcenteredness is to hope for a just order through antagonistic cooperation the thrust of the black university must be to overcome this subtle social warlikestate with the ethic of communalism this means that instead of hoping for social progress through the individual merits of its students or faculty qua individuals progress is to be viewed as a social process through which the community is uplifted with the aid of its contributing people this then means that while students and faculty play a very vital role they are coworkers alongside the equally important others eg the community organizer the artist the union organizer moreover the goal of the university must be one of service to the community the students faculty and administration of the black universitv must consider  themselves as servants to the broader afroamerican community being a member of the university must be considered an honor but more important this honor must be one involving responsibility to the total community and not simply focusing on the imadeitbecauseimsmarterthan kind of thinking being servants status is not based on the academic credentials university people create for themselves rather it is on the extent to which the total community is able to reap benefits from the service provided the service of the black university must not be one transmitted through mass communication or ritualistic ceremony but through a concrete programmatic movement toward liberation the time when the afroamerican community must be armslength from its institutions of higher education is over the pimps prostitutes preachers and phds must find a common bond to change themselves and weave an organic unity as the basis for liberation and a better life for all these goals must redefine two dangerouslypervasive patterns found among afroamerican faculty and students today one of the patterns is for education to be simply a process of acclimation and adjustment to the white world one goes to a white school to rub shoulders with them because son you got to make a livin out in their world another pattern is the playculture of friendship cliques and fraternity life whether it is mimicry of whites think of fort lauderdale in the spring or defection based on hopelessness we must find the recipe for a revolutionary discipline consistent with our desire for immediate radical change a free man is also and must be a responsible man and so must afroamerican students and faculty be responsible to themselves by being responsible to the black community the values of the black university must support the liberation movement of afroamericans oppressed people around the world and all that prevents man from leading the good life we must find a synthesis of efficient reason and purposive compassion the value placed on scientific methods must be joined by an equally important value placed on empathy ie sci entific detachment must be limited to method and technique complemented with involvement and commitment the students and faculty must be evangelical in their social roles and give new meaning to being a missionary for freedom and finally the black university must impart to all who are associated with it the strength to be alone the struggle against ignorance just as with the struggle of power is one within which the forces of good are often small in number and sparsely placed an afroamerican of the black university must have inner strength positive historical identity and a vision of the good for only in having these traits will he be able to stand up in a world dominated by evil and be secure even in being alone among its many functions the university is most concerned with knowledge both the accumulated information and insights of human history and the vision and process of new discovery and it is knowledge about afroamericans that is most lacking or biased and wrong in all these respects the black university is based on the fundamental assumption that the afroamerican community is in e franklin fraziers words a little social world a human universe heretofore misused or ignored by higher education consider these autobiographical comments by dr du bois when i went south to fisk i became a member of a closed racial group with rites and loyalties with a history and a corporate future with an art and philosophy into this world i leapt with provincial enthusiasm a new loyalty and allegiance replaced my americanism henceforth i was a negro the black university must respond creatively to just these realities which were true for du bois in  and equally true for this author in the s            the knowledge of afroamericans just as with africa is yet to be fully reclaimed with the full scope of university activities research teaching etc revision is needed to secure for colored peoples of the world their proper place in human history this revision of educational materials is a process as much political as it is scholarly with scholarly work a text of usa history can be written but only with political influence will it be made available by getting it published placed in a library or adopted as recommended reading however in the present it would be foolish to think of throwing everything aside revision of what is must be a thorough job of systematic and rigorous scholarship backed by the concerted political efforts of afroamerican students faculty and the entire community but more important and more difficult there is a need to find new styles of scholarship new forms of knowledge new ways of knowing these new developments must be consistent with what is to be known and have utility for the liberation movement there must be research on all aspects of the black experience research necessarily not limited to traditional scholarly disciplines but open to the demands of the subject for example the blues component of afroamerican culture demands a historian musicologist literary historian sociologist etc the soul of a people must be reflected in the results of the research as well as the life style of the black university we must be in search of the funky sociologist the soulful political scientist and the university president who can get down these are some of the necessary ingredients of a black university and while we can at best look to the future for its full realization it is quite possible now to suggest a structural outline that reflects these fundamental assumptions about its social and intellectual role the diagram on page  suggests three related colleges concerned with distinct areas though bound together in the idea of the university each would be organized around research teaching and practice for every part of the university community there would be 
centers for international study asia africa latin america  international conference center
an advisory board of community representatives from all walks of life with the task of providing policy suggestions and guidelines this would insure the community of ties to the specific parts of the university as one enters the university he will be faced with a variety of degree programs and alternative courses of study it is quite clear that the standard fouryear college degree meets only a partial need for the afroamerican community but even the student entering the college of liberal arts would have to work at least a year in one or more of the other two colleges in order to meet the requirements for graduation the general principle might well be that to meet the needs of today the new programs will have to take less time but those set up to meet the needs of tomorrow will have to take more time as a national institution engaged in activities found nowhere else the component colleges of the black university would be of great service to a wide variety of groups service professionals working with afroamericans face a challenge supported by sparse research and little experience the college of afroamerican studies being a center of innovation and discovery concerning these problems will conduct special courses and training programs so that students can supplement their training and experience with a concentrated program there is a desperate need for social workers teachers lawyers doctors psychiatrists etc and the same kind of function is planned for the entire university there also must be connected with such a university a set of centers of international study they will be small centers specializing in specific areas in order that together they might constitute an international program without superficially missing the peculiar character of each part of the world in addition no such university could hope to function without an international conference center available to the university community and accommodating other activities consistent with the aims and purpose of the university community and liberation movement afro americans are moving onto the international scene and so must have at their disposal a center where such meetings can be held as stated at the beginning of this discussion there is no panacea for the afroamerican liberation movement just as there can and will be no monolithic organizational structure but there can be operational unity around such concepts as the black university the first step in moving toward this operational unity moving toward the black university is to begin a creative and honest dialogue among afroamericans but more than that we need small bands of people in positions to act to make steps to be daring enough to risk failure or worse irrelevance it will only be when these ideas can be referred to in concrete terms that definitive statements can be made and the concrete reality of the black university must begin today one last thought the afroamerican community does not possess unlimited resources with which to carry on experiment after experiment each of us who can contribute to the black university must ask himself what he is doing for it what he is doing for this kind of operational unity i am calling for all of the brothers and sisters in other colleges and university settines to come on home and to those at home let us get this thing together 
the black university a practical approach

ost reform ends in revolution perhaps that will be the inevitable result in any effort to reform higher education for negroes in the united states nevertheless before proposing the revolutionary step of establishing a new institutiona black universityi wish to suggest ways of achieving the desired improvement within the present structure of higher education for fear that the very discussion of this issue may seem to provide substance for those hostile critics who argue that negroes are peculiar creatures always demanding or needing special attention i must point out that the need for reform is not limited to the education of negroes higher education in the united states needs attention it is a mongrel conceived from the forced wedding of the european ideal of educating the elite to the united states ideal of educating the masses students complain about their loss of identity their isolation from professors their inability to receive respect as young adults and their subjection to antiquated or absurd academic regulations hp courses and materials teachers complain about the disinterest of students and about the overemphasis on athletics grants and research administrators complain about the continuous complaining by students and teachers although negroes share in these characteristic and perennial problems of higher education negroes experience additional problems both in the integrated colleges and in the predominantly negro colleges the negro teacher in an integrated institution knows that he exists as a visible symbol of liberal attitudes and practices of brotherhood if he is one in a million he may become the chairman of his department or who is there besides john hope franklin if he is especially astute in his studies of negroes he may aspire to be a kenneth b clark most often however he rises to the lowly post of assistant or associate professor and squirms there the channels to prominence are dammed for him even though his intelligence and training may surpass those of men who rise beyond his rank if he works in a predominantly negro college he generally must live in the south professionally his growth is restricted by the cultural isolation the poverty and the apathy frequently characteristic of such institutions because he may become a professor a dean or even a president he may earn more money than he would in an integrated institution psychologically however he struggles to maintain selfrespect when professional friends accuse him of martyrdom or worse even though the quality of instruction in individual classes may equal that observed in any college in the country widely publicized reports by white men have proclaimed the innate inferiority of such institutions thus as long as he remains attached to a predominantly negro college he too is adjudged inferior or at best an exception a smallsized frog in a muddy cesspool it is no wonder that vacillating between such harsh alternatives negro educators frequently dream of a black university in which they might rise to a level ordained by their talents and ambition while commanding the professional respect accorded to teachers at prestige institutions similarly sensitive negro students feel repressed in integrated institutions prospects are brighter for them than for negro teachers they may be elected to such exalted positions as homecoming queen or president of a club or even a class the only requirement  is that they be exceptional in intelligence athletic ability charm or beauty or that the school be campaigning to prove its liberality if they are average or enroll during the wrong year they drop into obscurity where they remain far more hidden than are white classmates of equal talent regardless of their prominence they experience restrictions in social life academically some suffer from the prejudice of instructors who believe negroes incapable of swimming above c level still others intelligent students may suspect that they are being crippled by condescending tolerance their answers are accepted too easily their mistakes are forgiven too quickly they fear that they are being hurried along with good grades by teachers willing to evaluate negroes on lowered standards because after graduation the negroes will disappear into their own world where their ignorance will neither injure nor threaten the white world furthermore whether talented or average these students will be taught very little about the worthy achievements of other negroes as students in a predominantly negro college they may achieve more local prominence as individuals but they have read the studies which advise them and the world that their education is inferior this knowledge creates double dangers first although they resent the situation which labels them inferior by association they subconsciously come to accept the judgment consequently they fail to drive themselves as industriously as they would in integrated institutions and too frequently they protest against the teachers who demand collegelevel work from them second because they lack firsthand knowledge of integrated colleges they assume that each weakness which they observe must be unique to predominantly negro colleges and must be further evidence of the inferiority of such institutions like negro teachers they want to be part of an institution which will afford the opportunity to develop their talents and the prestige merited by their achievements let us therefore dream of the ideal institutionone which will give growth to negro teachers and students alike it is i repeat one which can be developed within the current framework of higher educationif it is to be developed at all endowment a university must have money good teachers and good administratorswhether white or black go where salaries will buy all the necessities and hopefully some of the luxuries money is needed for classroom buildings dormitories staff equipment and supplies predominantly negro colleges have lacked money they have depended upon state legislators churches generous patrons alumni and students except in california legislators spend money for education as grudgingly as a temperance worker gives alcoholics money for liquor generally one statesupported university is favored the rest beg the least successful beggars have been the predominantly negro colleges which have lacked alumni who seated in southern legislatures might trade votes for dollars more limited in funds churches frequently have doled their allotments with the prayer that sacrifice and dedication might substitute for cash donorsboth individuals and foundationshave been generous at times but planning a black university one cannot afford to forget that the majority of philanthropic supporters of negroes higher education are white negro alumni have contributed but deficient in both number and wealth they generally have been unable to provide more than a few scholarships and some spending change tuition has been an important source of revenue but it is a troublesome source raise tuition too high fewer students attend increase the number of students additional money is needed for teachers equipment supplies and facilities furthermore the quality of the student too frequently is lowered when additional quantity is sought  an obvious method to use to secure the necessary money would be an appeal to the negro populace to support a worthy cause an average contribution of one dollar for every negro in the united states would furnish working capitalsixteen or seventeen million dollars but will enough negroes contribute sufficiently generously to a single university i fear pessimistically that this ideal institution must continue to depend partially upon contributions from white patronsfederal or private who traditionally weaken in generosity as a negro institution gains in affluence of course in a black state or a black nation it would be possible to secure sufficient money by a minimal tax but i must make clear that i am not considering a black state or nation on the continent of north america although i would be happy to be part of a nation where a black man might be elected president in  i do not judge such a nation to be practicable in north america where it would begin  years behind the other countries where its creation would require uprooting settled people and where its existence might depend upon consciencecontributions from people notoriously untroubled by conscience when comfort and cash are at stake no i must discuss the possibilities of an ideal institution for negroes within the united states to secure sufficient money such an  institution must discover a way to tap the pocketbooks of moneyed negroes as no other negro cause has succeeded in doing all methods must be usedcollections in churches dances by fraternal organizations door to door soliciting telephone and mail canvassing raffles and the solicitors must have substantial arguments to offset the prejudice against higher education the disinterest in national causes and the suspicion of solicitors   ?   ¦          i      curricula in considering second the question of what the negro student should learn i am merely giving high priority to the complaint of negro students that they learn too little about themselves and about ways to improve their community although i admit the justice of the charge i cannot blame anyone except negro faculty membersmyself included unimaginatively we like thousands of white educators have reproduced for our students the same education which we received we have wanted our students to possess the kind of knowledge respected by the semiintegrated society which will surround them after graduation but we have failed to realize sufficiently the need to provide them with additional knowledge required for the segregated society the black society the little circle inside of and ignored bythe large circle we can blame ourselves nothingto my knowledgeprevents predominantly negro colleges from offering any course that is desired i am fully aware that some southern legislators or governors have applied pressure to some negro college presidents in an effort to curb demonstrations i know also that some negro college presidents have succumbed to such pressure or timidly have restricted student activity in anticipation of such pressure certainly having taught in north carolina for nine years i know how legislators may try to restrict freedom of speech fearful of communism the legislature of north carolina banned from appearance on campuses any acknowledged communist or anyone who had pleaded the fifth amendment educators in north carolina understood however that this law was not aimed at the predominantly negro colleges the white legislators scarcely knew nor cared who spoke to the negro students the legislators and their constituents concerned themselves with the speakers who came to the campuses of the large statesupported universities i do not know any instance in which a state official has opposed an attempt to introduce any raciallyoriented course at a predominantly negro college of course i have no primary knowledge of what happens in education in mississippi or alabama those bastions of confederate racism i do know teachers in those states however and have no reason to believe that courses have been denied the fact is that negro educators and i must include myself have not conceived courses oriented to the negro aside from the history of the negro in america a course in literature by negro american writers and possibly a course or two in sociology including a discussion of the problems of minority groups few educators have proposed courses studying the achievements of black men i know no course in the history of art or music of negroes no history of education which includes a study of predominantly negro segregated public schools and colleges no linguistics course which analyzes the socalled negro dialect there should be sociology courses analyzing the structure of the negro community business courses describing methods of organizing cooperative community businesses more courses concentrated on practices in small businesses these courses are desirable can be established and must be established even at the predominantly negro colleges as currently structured the irony is that they may be established first and condescendingly at predominantly white institutions this new information however cannot be substituted for other more traditional knowledge it must be additional i hesitate to use the term supplementary only because some readers may assume that i regard it as less important to the contrary it is significant however if the negro student is provided only with knowledge about negroes then his education will be as restricted as it has been in the past his vision true will be black instead of white but the revisers of the curriculum will be guilty of the same colorblindness and narrow vision for which they condemn the planners of the present curriculum research despite the extravagances committed in its name research is the consort of good teaching a teacher must have information about his subject before significant changes can be made in curricula for negro students considerable research will be needed for shamefully facts about negroes are not known or have been gathered by white researchers too frequently in quickly published studies where a limited sampling was used to substantiate a preconceived generalization about an entire population just as predominantly negro colleges have been compared unfavorably with the ideal of a college or with the prestige institutions rather than with predominantly white colleges of comparable size and endowment so negroes as individuals and groups have been evaluated against the ideal rather than judged in comparison with white peers of similar economic educational and social background new research is needed extensive research is needed there are negroes qualified to perform such research but ways must be devised to provide researchers with the time needed and to persuade foundations to  trust negro researchers to conduct scholarly studies of negroes without such research the new courses cannot be offered for it is better to teach nothing than to teach something which is known to be merely a guess  f m    «  publishing the black university needs to publish the research of its scholars today white publishers respect research into problems of negroes primarily when it is conducted by white men a negro scholar
faculty curriculum research

s i see it the black university may exist in the following forms  as a new institution  as an institution already existing in toto and  as an institution already existing in part both physically and intellectually now it strikes me that the first choice for practical men is unrealistic and wasteful since the need is immediate and the founding and supporting of a strong institution so costly and timeconsuming that it would unduly diffuse the already too meager financial and professional resources of the black community can we turn then to a black university which already exists in toto the question of course is rhetorical for if one such institution existed there would be no need for a discussion of the desirabilitv of such an insti or tution this consequently leaves us with the third possibility an institution already existing in part physically and intellectually it appears to me that although the black university does not at present exist anywhere in toto it does exist in part in that residue of blacknesssocial cultural and philosophicalwhich is found in the socalled predominantly negro colleges or to use another circumlocution in the historically negro colleges the problem becomes then a matter of modifying some one or more of these institutions personally i have no doubt that such modification is necessary indeed it seems to me inevitable some perhaps many of these schools will survive with relatively little change others will perish either absorbed into their various state budgets or through consolidation or through absorption into the cloudy american mainstream strangely enough this lastnamed fate seems to be eagerly anticipated by many institutions which with few exceptions have sizeable white numbers in their faculties but virtually no white students in their enrollment riesman and jencks have already analyzed this phenomenon so i am content to observe that schools are for the education of students not for the employment of teachers once we accept that simple fact the pathetic absurdity of calling our schools predominantly negro becomes altogether too clear it indicates a curious ambivalence which is characteristic of all of our relationships with the rest of the country we say predominantly negro meaning perhaps that this is a temporary situation that what we really want is to be integrated ie to be a minorityin our own schools why is it that we doubt our own capacity to give our children a quality education or even to raise our children at all that same ambivalence lurks behind the whole thrust of the recent civil_rights movement another aspect of this ambivalence is perhaps the secret wish to retain the schools as predominantly negro ie to retain power and control and decisionmaking in our own hands if that is what we mean then why do we apologize for it god knows its natural enough and its a salutary develop ment to see as a practical expression of black consciousness that parents and teachers and pupils in northern urban high schools are demanding just that kind of control if such a desire is natural then why do the negro colleges equivocate i submit that they do so out of confusion or out of fearconfusion as to their role in a society marked by constant crisis confusion as to the nature of the changes taking place in that society fear of offending their white supporters and faculty and fear of reevaluating the premises on which the institutions themselves are predicated by nature of the problem to which i address myself the schools which best illustrate this anxiety are our socalled liberal arts colleges they represent the heart of the problem since their ultimate function is to shape the students mind and soul in such a way that he can perform most efficiently and happily in his world glancing at random through statements of institutional purpose of many of the schools one discovers quite soon that the purpose actually if stated in fashionable language is to help the student discover his identity through acquainting him with the history the culture and the forms of belief of western civilization even this limited aim has never been carried out on any large scale and it hasnt been done chiefly because as educators we took the passive role and assumed that the experience of blackness is irrelevant to western history and civilization and hence to our students and our own search for identity the single revolutionary concept that has emerged in recent years is that the black experience is not only relevant in such a search it is fundamental and crucial one might almost call it archetypal for from it can be derived not only americas quest for selfhood but indeedsince the black experience is also the type of the colonial experience and reaction to itthe whole modern experience of europe as well how absurd it is then to assume as some critics do that a black university would exist in a vacuum when the question of identitythe question of blacknessis more than a matter of pigmentation when it is ultimately a moral and philosophical position in other words one finally wills to be black this is what the fuss is all aboutalbert cleage adam powell walter white frank silvera willed in varying degrees to be black my firm belief is that by willing to be black in that philosophical sense our schools can make a greater contribution to our personal wellbeing and to the world at large than by any other means that i can presently see what does this willtoblackness entail it entails a certain double vision not the double vision of du bois but a shift in perspective in which one looks inward into himself and the group and sees outward with sharper msight in which one looks backward into his history and his cultural roots and discovers that he is looking forward it is like looking backward in time though one is looking forward in space through a telescope if through this process one discovered god in the actual act of creation and with a new physics we might ones knowledge would be complete vaughan the poet said there is in god they say a deep and dazzling darkness and it is for the reason of this liberating god within us that we must confront our blackness immediately we must confront it because we have to no inconsiderable extent africanized this country that time it was unconscious and passive this time it must be otherwise for unless the values inherent in soul and negritude are made to prevail in this country we may yet find ourselves at armageddon across the seas in our skies and in our own city streets assuming then my estimate of the importance of the black university to be valid i shall briefly discuss what seems to me the feasibility of such an institution first if black college presidents willed to be black the problem would be very much simpler though by no means simple for to some extent philosophical blackness or soul exists in all of our institutionsif not in individual courses then in faculty or students our immediate problem thus is to bring this blackness as it were to a saturation point this means conscious reorganization and concentration of human and other resources preferably as i see it in several regional centers which already exist in the baltimored c area in the norfolk area in the durhamgreensboro area in the nashville area in the atlanta area in the tallahassee area in the new orleans area and in the houston area depending on the degree of cooperation they would become centers of black consciousness or units of a single de facto suprainstitutional black university the simplest thing to do of course would be for college presidents to recognize the schizophrenia implicit in being predominantly negro and simply declare themselves to be black people working especially for the good of black people though excluding no one because of color or ethnic origin their mission being to capitalize on the unique importance of the black experience to this country and to the world if we were honest with ourselves and if national spokesmen for cultural pluralism were serious then presi dents would have no fear of losing financial and moral support indeed the federal government and private industry in such a case should have no qualms at all about paying some interest on that great invisible national debt the vast backlog of salary which they owe us for almost  years of economic exploitation but this is too much to hope for and too naive since recent pronouncements by some of our presidents indicate their determination to die the white death while others indicate an unfortunate confusion of a personal revulsion for extremes of pigmentation with the legitimate concern which black students have with the ultimate purpose of liberal educationfreedom through selfknowledge the recourse then must lie in the willtoblackness of the faculty and the students when this will becomes strong enough when it becomes informed in all senses of the word with soul when it reaches the saturation point or better still when it reaches critical mass it will demand institutional restructuringin faculty in general resources and in acknowledged aims some of these changes may take place comparatively rapidly and thoroughly in a few strategic institutions in others they may not occur at all in some to pursue a figure the energy will be harnessed for the good of all in others the result may well be destructive social explosion that the resistance is formidable is obvious to anyone who reads the newspapers that the change will come is equally obvious to all but the blind and the deaf who really have no business at all in the crucial task of educating this new black generation who well may be our last hope for sanity and decency in this country some of the changes i speak of may occur through the following structures  regional organization  shared resources  systematic and continual faculty and student exchange and  black humanists and specialists in blackness by regional organization i mean several things the first is the establishment of honest and creative relationships with nonacademic black intellectual communities i mean the establishment of new and respectable relationships with the black nonintellectual communities i mean the establishment of genuine lines of communication between academic institutions in the same region that is exchange below the administrative level this type of organization is admittedly difficult but models do exist the atlanta university center is moving in this direction from this type of regional reorganization could come more concrete objectives shared resources both general and human let us take an example of each first the general by this i mean nonhuman resources such as library holdings art collections and the like i submit that the average black student has no real notion of the richness of the fisk negroana collection or the howard library or the atlanta university negro collections of books manuscripts and paintings fewer students still know anything of the schomberg collection and honesty compels me to say that altogether too few professors know very much about these collections whose fault is it our own but fortunately structures already exist which could make it possible for even the smallest the poorest negro college to will itself to a saving state of blackness as i have suggested its contours above if a panel of artists and critics comparable to the one which set up the recent exhibit of afroamerican painting at city college new york could cull the best and the most representative examples of african and afroamerican art which our colleges possess it should be a relatively simple matter to make slides and reproductions available at a nominal fee even to these colleges both it seems to me lie within the possibility of a title iii grant manuscript material and other comparatively rare items could be made available on microfilm with provisions made for printouts this is just an obvious example a more thorough going proposition would be the establishment of an information retrieval system connected with the regional resources of our best schools and even with the special resources of the nations largest graduate schools i see the irony in this latter statement but what do you do at a black university if someone else has your ancestral artifactsraid the british museum ultimately the purpose of such a system would be to stimulate students and faculty alike to visit the institutions where the originals exist this brings us to the next point human resources these resources are naturally faculty and students the problem of course is to get them together on a meaningful basis across institutional lines now some few students and faculty might be stimulated enough or may have the financial resources to visit schools with special library or art holdings but this is not enough what is needed it seems to me is some plan whereby a continual interchange of ideas and opinions may be insured on a personal facetoface basis this can be done by a system of student exchange between centers of blackness and negro colleges oddly enough a good deal of this was done a few years ago only the exchange was in effect between centers of whiteness and negro colleges i remember a boy from the midwest who left after a few days on my campus suffering i was told from culture shock obviously such a system can work only if the administration of the negro school is sympathetic or apathetic it remains for students and faculty to will the change to create the structure at any rate the visits could last anywhere from a weekend to a semester depending on the academic standards of the institution and other such sticky business a visitation period of a semester would presuppose that the student would find something worth his time in one of the regional black centers what he should find is a group of gifted black humanists who have assembled or have been assembled at a center for the express purposes of the black university as stated above presumably at first there wouldnt be enough of these people to staff all of the schools which may require them presumably some of the schools may not be able to afford to pay them and one couldnt expect them to starve black starvation is still starvation no matter how soulful still it would be possible especially for the politically aggressive and the academically and artistically talented for a sizeable number of students no matter how poor to be brought into dialogue with this group of dedicated and gifted teachers the student might even spend time in two or more such situations obtaining the kind of experience 
the black university and its community
by j herman blake
order to become a viable institution and to make a meaningful contribution to the black community the black university must be cognizant of the varied and complex developments among black people these developments should become an explicit part of course offerings in an effort to develop a philosophy and ideology which will permit us to analyze and evaluate social change in the black community from a perspective of blackness the decade of the s will certainly go down in history as one in which major contradictory trends developed in black communities across the nation this is the decade that has seen black people achieve higher political offices than ever before two of the nations major cities have elected black men as mayors another black man was elected as senator from a new england state a black man sits on the cabinet of the president and another black man sits on the supreme court all of these are dramatic and significant firsts for black people in the sixties and they portend further changes with these developments have come other phenomena which indicate the perplexing and troubled situation within black communities for this is also the first decade to see major urban insurrection for four consecutive summers with the most recent outbursts far more severe than any previous ones this is the decade that has seen more and more black militants take up the philosophy of selfdefense when attacked viewing violent action as an effective approach to black dignity and manhood this is the decade that has seen more and more black youth refusing to serve in the armed forces of the united states on the grounds that the nation is engaged in a program of genocide against black people in other lands and within its own confines the nation is also practicing genocide against blacks these contradictory trends amongst black people in americaon the one hand some black men getting more rewards for participating in the system and on the other hand black men refusing to participate regardless of the rewardsmust be taken into consideration by a black university for the contradiction requires some resolution in this paper we shall review several recent and major demographic trends in the black community to shed some light upon some of the underlying variables in this perplexing situation there are a variety of ways in which these changes can be analyzed but we choose to focus upon two general approaches  where we were at the beginning of the decade or an earlier point as compared to where we are now and  the relative changes in the black and white communities and where these changes leave us in relation to those who so utterly fail to understand our condition the varieties of variables that one might select the different statistical measures that might be applied and the different base populations or starting points make it easy to prove any point one wishes to prove about the black community we hope to avoid this problem in some instances notably income by presenting several measures to show the trends in the black communitv  one of the most significant twentiethcentury trends among black people has been the redistribution of the population from the country to the city and out of the south to the north and west this trend has continued into the sixties between  and  the proportion of black people in the south declined from  to  percent we should not ignore the fact however that despite a vast migratory trend the majority of the black people still live in the south and blacks make up onefifth of the total population in the southern states in addition to the movement out of the south black people have been moving into cities and the large ones at that in both north and south the recent appointment of a black mayor in washington d c and the election of black men to mayoralties in gary and cleveland is a direct manifestation of the presence of large black populations in these cities over half  percent of all black people now live in the central cities of metropolitan areas and the population increase has been fastest in the largest cities in metropolitan areas with one million or more persons black people comprise onefourth of the central city population and the experts estimate that in  black people were at least  percent or more of the population of  of the  largest cities in the country these cities and the proportions of their population which are black are as follows washington  newark  atlanta  new orleans  memphis  baltimore  st louis  cleveland  detroit  philadelphia  chicago  the evidence indicates that more black people than ever before are both interested in education and are taking advantage of every opportunity to increase their knowledge the statistics on the proportions of blacks completing high school and college show some interesting and significant trends in   percent of all black males and  percent of all black females between the ages of  had completed high school however by   percent of all black males and  percent of all black females in the same age category had completed high school not only was there a dramatic increase in the proportion of young adults with high school diplomas the number of young males completing high school now exceeds the number of young females although the proportions are much lower the same trend holds for those completing college in   percent of all black males between the ages of  and  and  percent of all black females had completed four or more years of college by  these proportions had increased to  percent for males and  percent for females if the dramatic increase in high school completions is any indicator we can expect substantial improvements in the number of black youth with college degrees in the next few years it is not at all insignificant in considering a black university to recognize that the educational experience of black youth still takes place in predominantly black schools where the culture of black people is maintained in the inter action of the youth if not in the educational curriculum sixtysix percent of all black youths in the twelfth grade in  were in schools which were predominantly black so these youth would probably be more comfortable and at ease in black institutions of higher education despite the movement into cities where occupational opportunity is said to be higher despite higher levels of education the employment situation of black people has changed little from the last hired first fired status since the early fifties the unemployment rate for black people has been about twice as high as that for whites and it has remained this way until the present day although unemployment rates have fluctuated considerably in  the unemployment rate for black people went up to  percent the highest since   but it has dropped steadily in subsequent years it went down to  percent in  and the decline continued to  percent for the first nine months of  black people are overrepresented in every category of unemployment during the first nine months of  blacks comprised  percent of the civilian labor force but were  percent of all unemployed workers and  percent of those persons unemployed for at least three and a half consecutive months teenagers still suffer the most of those without jobs for in the first part of  the unemployment rate for black youth between  and  was  percent more than twice the rate for white youth between  and  there were substantial increases in the number of black people holding white collar positions and less dramatic but still increases for blacks holding blue collar positions the increase in white collar employment shows the largest gain in clerical and sales positions blacks are still underrepresented in the skilled white collar positions as of  with the situation for black males and black females showing some significant differences in professional and technical positions black males represent  percent as many as there would be if there were full occupational equality while females in the same category represent  percent as many as would be found in a situation of full equality on the other hand in the clerical positions black males represent  percent as many as would be found in a situation of full equality while black females comprise only  percent these and other data which we have analyzed indicate that the black female has a better chance of obtaining a job consistent with her education and training than the black male in the professional technical and managerial categories while black males are more likely than females to be adequately represented in clerical positions the chronic problems black people face with education employment and occupational levels are reflected in the income levels of the population although the sixties have seen changes in income for blacks there are varying interpretations of income changes in the black community and they produce different conclusions some analysts talk about the income of families while others talk about the income of persons and then differentiate between males and females furthermore income changes can be analyzed in terms of the percentage change in median income the ratio of black to white median income or the absolute blackwhite differences in income let us see how the black situation in the sixties stands up in terms of all these measurements in   percent of all black families had incomes under  per year  percent of all white families were at this level but by  this had declined to  percent of all families  percent for whites the proportion of black families with incomes between  and  went up from  to  percent white families declined from  to  percent between  and  black families with incomes over  went up from  to  percent in the same period of time with a corresponding increase from  to  percent for white families these figures are ad

ne of the most insistent themes in the  literature of black america is the attempt to articulate our awareness of the presence of a certain dividedness in our deepest beings an inner tension which w e b du bois referred to as a twoness of spirit and soul while all americans even those who were here when the others came half a millennia ago are people of a broken past nowhere is the tension so often obvious as within the afroamerican community we are the largest single segment of the nation which holds within itself both east and west both africa and america both developed and developing societies for many of us the tension has been so unbearably painful that we have collapsed it on one or the other side until recently it was more often the western developed side which triumphed now of course there moves among us a renewed consciousness of our nonwesternness and in the ghettos of the land one easily senses that many black men are seeking to build and celebrate a newold nation in the midst of the worlds most developed society any university which grew with integrity out of the ground of our black experience in america would have to reflect and bear the creative agony of that tensionno matter how great the temptation to escape it the life of such an institution would in many ways testify to the westernization of our lives but if it is to make a major contribution to its students and their world the western experience cannot be its most important emphasis more than  colleges and universities in this country and hundreds more in europe already perform that task though predominantly negro institutions have long imitated such a direction those of us who seek to build faithfully out of the materials of the afroamerican experience are called to other paths  one major strength of a black university would be its internanationalism but its focus would not follow the style of the scores of international studies programs which have burgeoned in american institutions since the korean war instead the uniqueness of our approach to the world would be found in our vision through an unashamedly blackoriented prism in the academic program and in a hundred other less structured ways the black university would seek to explore celebrate and record the experiences of the nonwestern world because of much that we  have lived through our focus would be upon that segment of the nonwest which has existed under western domination for the relatively brief span of  years or less and which now shakes the world with its efforts to wrench free even within that group our specialty would rightfully be found among the peoples of africa both those who remained on the continent and those who were forced into the new world through the diaspora of slavery this in a peculiar way is our thing and we would have no less reason to build on it in a university setting than brandeis has for building on jewish studies or minnesota on immigrant studies or oklahoma on studies of the american indian in an article of this length it is possible only to suggest some of the directions such a blackoriented internationalism might take in a university context but certain lines are suggestive of the whole in the academic program one of the most attractive aspects of this focus would be comparative intercultural studies of many kinds especially in the humanities and the social sciences for instance in music we would try to develop an understanding of the continuities and discontinuities among the musical styles of africa and those of its scattered children in the northern and southern portions of the black new world the dance and the drama would present obvious analogues for possible study we would also attempt to explore the implications of the strong similarities which a noted literary authority claims he has found in the literature recently coming out of harlem and out of black johannesburg what fascinating insights might courses in comparative black literature produce when we realize that there are sections of cuba and other parts of latin america where african religious practices are alive and prospering it is obvious that the study of comparative religious development is also filled with new possibilities in such a context especially as those who know black folk religion in the united states remind us of the persistent presence of a belief in religious magic here or it may be that in such a setting careful elaboration would be done on a significant interdisciplinary as well as intercultural academic monograph such as lanternaris the religions of the oppressed for here in a study of the messianic movements of the nonwestern world it is clear that history political science sociology psychology and religion encounter and enrich each other few settings would be more congenial to such mutual intellectual fertilization than the kind of institution we envision indeed such a study as lanternaris strongly suggests that the blackoriented university could present a marvelous opportunity for the social sciences in america to break out of their nationalistic trap sociology might include such matters as urban development among black people in nairobi chicago and rio political science could well analyse the forms of resistance to colonial domination in harlem cuba mozambique and vietnam so too might specialists in education try to understand the ways in which indians africans and afroamericans have attempted to rescue their educational systems from the domination of structures and ideologies shaped in england france and white america seminars in nonwestern cultural nationalisms of the modern world might be filled with excitement and profit for those who are trying to discern develop and sustain an afroamerican style of life the academic curriculum would be of course only one of the places in which the unique internationalism of the black university might be expressed special institutes on afroamerican using american in the hemispheric sense culture would abound colloquies on a subject like slavery would engage scholars from all over the new world especially those who still bear the marks which were first painfully known by their ancestors conferences on such topics as the role of women in reemerging societies would simply be part of the breathing of such a school symposia on strategies for social change in the former colonial societies would be sponsoredbut not by the american state department think tanks filled with the varied but constant experience of blackness might be established for the sole purpose of analyzing specific conflict situations from detroit to angola and beyond and suggesting directions of actions and ideology for those who are struggling to break away from the hegemony of the west from such a university there would go out teams of specialists in development whose primary concerns would not include the opening of wedges for american influences rather their search would be for ways in which modernization might be purged of its synonymous relationship with westernization and americanization throughout the black university and in all of its special projects the emphasis would be on the search for new models for new systems for new ways of life free from the suffocating grasp of the most current forms of imperialism not only would specialists be sent out in such a search but other kinds of specialists would be brought in representatives of the anticolonial forces members of liberation fronts religious and educational leaders from the re borning nations would be invited and welcomed in order to give deeper meaning to the searching indeed such a university might well become a sanctuary of sorts for some of the worlds revolutionaries what better way to raise the hard questions which many revolutions often force honest intellectuals to ask such an institution would selfconsciously be orienting its students toward an understanding of and an appreciation forthe myriad ways in which our experiences here as colonials who were brought to the mother country parallel those of our brothers who had to receive the emissaries of countless white fatherlands it would of course also stress the uniqueness of the afroamerican colonial experience as a part of developing this sense of common experienceand common roots summer study and junior years abroad in europe would likely become the exception and black students would move toward latin america africa india and asia for their experience of intercultural exchange and overseas study this direction would of course have significant implications for the languages taught in the institution german for instance might have difficulties both student and faculty exchanges with the nonwestern world would become a regular part of the black universitys life the journal of such a center might well seek to ally itself with the new world publication of the caribbean with presence africaine and with other lesser known publications of the nonwestern intellectuals the university would be serviceoriented in the largest sense of that term it would set up skills banks for developing nations and it would urge those students who do not return to the black american communities to offer their skills in africa latin america and wherever else they are needed and desired conceivably a blackoriented overseas service corps might develop and this would not only provide excellent nationbuilding opportunities but it could become an alternative to action with the united states military forces for it is likely that the international orientation of a black university will create many dissenters to the foreign policy which our armed forces now enforce should it refuse to enter the lists of american foreign policy supporters should it become a significant source of dissent and the center of a search for new ways of international life it is not easy to know how the black university would be funded indeed if it saw reason to move beyond experiments in nationbuilding to the search for a new world society in which nations played a far less significant role its enemies might come from the nationalistic left as well as the right certain monies would not be available others like some connected with black chicago slums or african diamond mining might not be accepted a free black university might be forced into existence for the present that is the problem of other writers and other moments at this moment it may suffice to say that the black university must seek to be faithful to the best dreams of our greatest twentieth century black dreamers from du bois to frantz fanon it should at least attempt to place the rise of the west in proper historical perspective refusing either to do homage toor to be terrified bywhat may well prove to be no more than a hyperactive aberration in the context of mankinds long essentially nonwestern pilgrimage such a service to truth would be no mean accomplishment in itself nevertheless to speak of fanon is to suggest even more for it may be that in its international aspects such an institution might well take as its fiercely driving theme the call of his last chapter in the wretched of the earth there his words were a call out of the darkness of hopeless cynical reaction on the one hand and out of ersatz brightness of imitative european styles on the other it was a call to the lightfilled sometimes blinding gruelling search for new shapes and forms for patterns which deal wisely with the longer lines of history and the deepest needs of men ultimately of course he urged for europe for ourselves and for humanity comrades we must turn over a new leaf we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new man ? as such his call is heir to all the pitfalls of messianism at most and to the disillusions of aborted hope at least nevertheless it may well be far better that a university should search and reach and possibly fail at the practice of such hope than that it sell out to the highest bidder and live on in the style to which america has accustomed us if it is better to try to do our thing then let us press on towards the black university

oward uni versiv t ty spreads like a il i complex of cancerous sores on a breastlike m  hill in the heart of one of the worst sectionsby most criteriaof the district of columbia the university which is drably cached in subdued majesty midway the census tracts heaviest in social disorganization was founded in hypocritical contradiction by an ambivalent general oliver otis howard apparently a godfearing religious fanatic who forewent his ambition to become a minister later a lawyer to gain power through military might and position my office during my first three years as a professor at howard was in a third floor corner of what once was general howards mansion on the campus from there i could see the washington monument and the capitol building just beyond the squalor of washingtons ghetto on the way to the office each day i passed through the confusion and anguish of students waiting in the building to gain admission to the counseling center where their educational fates would be dictated to them by hostile clerks hoping somehow to piece together the debris from overly zealous administrative decrees today viewing howard from a distance of more than a mile yet from the vantage point of an intimate exposure to its inner workings i am able to watch it writhe and quiver caught in the contlict between the new surge for black equality and the deathbed contortions of white supremacy and oppression it is a condition i have known first hand for more than six years and have studied thoroughly with the combined tools of the sociologist and the journalist i learned that howard university which acquired its first set of buildings illegally and became a monument to general o howard and his scheme has never broken entirely free from the grips of a militaryreligiouspolitical corruption with this influence criticized also by the great frederick douglass a colored member of the board of trustees who described the ring as hungry sharks with professions of piety upon their lips there developed in the words of john mercer langston who eventually resigned in protest from his position as dean of the law school the entire law school faculty with himbefore going on to become the first negro ever elected to public office in the united states appeared and grew the feeling that the negro whether as trusteee or member of the faculty is of small account indeed rather a pest only as he serves to give color to the enterprise    and with this feeling has constantly grown the idea that the colored youth attending the university are incapable of high intellectual achievement still by  the university which opened in  with an allwhite faculty and student body had a student body onehalf of one per cent white and a faculty less than nine per cent white today the graduate and professional schools notable in the medical professions where white rejects from white schools frequently have high enough scores to outdistance poorly trained black applicants are fast developing a white majority and this is also the trend for the liberal arts faculty where the average salary is higher for white professors than for black professors at the same rank just prior to the emergence of this trend as howard became the capstone of negro education it also became an epitome of political docility and academic nothingness groveling at the feet of outside mainly government expectations real or imagined and fawning upon white congressional appropriators however in an era of greater access to white colleges and rising negro expectations this footshuffling was proving inadequate as the centennial year approached in the competition for top students and professors faced with this predicament administrators merely intensified their stepin fetchit tactics then in september  president james nabrit announced in the washington post a plan to make howard sixty per cent white by  a plan opposed by virtually every student on campus to accomplish this goal the university had devised an ingenious program for excluding or and removing black students while attracting white ones some professors were warned by the deans office through departmental chairmen instructed to counsel them that their grade distributions should approximate a normal distribution regardless of the caliber of a given class and specifically should include a minimum of failing marks at the same time it was decided to raise standards by raising by  points the required score on entrance tests standardized on children of urban middleclass white exposure many culturally deprived black students would not of course be expected to manage such a score white students who flunked would not need to humiliate themselves enrolling in a precollege sequence at howard hence a proposed special division for students who fail the test would invariably be black these subnormals would have to spend a year preparing to enter the new white howard having failed the test as individuals their selfesteem would further be decimated for they would be set apart as failures and subjected to an egomortifying curriculum first they were to receive a speech course already incorporated at howard frankly calcu lated to force black students to lose their ingroup dialects despite the fact that president nabrit himself has been successful in supreme court presentations in a classical negro dialect such students also were to be given a course in reading skills and simultaneously one in masterpieces of world literature it goes without saying that masterpiece authors would be invariably if not exclusively caucasian still another course was history of western civilization not world civilization as in the case of the masterpieces this curriculum would say to black students who already were failures as individuals that they had no ennobling ancestral roots their kind had produced no civilization worthy of attention no literary achievements and indeed are guilty now of the wrong mode of speech it is true even now at howard within the normal curriculum that a liberal arts student cannot take a course in negro history unless he is a history major anyway i wrote a letter mocking the idea of the whitewash program and the letter appeared in the hilltop the campus newspaper the first issue in september of the centennial year immediately i came under pressure losing first a promotion to chairman of the division of social sciences and other privileges which publicly had been promised me and this was an early object lesson of relentless pressure including subjection to a network of student and faculty spies one day toward the end of september while discussing the effects of urbanization on social norms i criticized the obsolescence of some professed codes of sexual conduct then as if to salvage the class from its shock gave assurances of my abiding adherence to them i told of my efforts the previous year to launch an association of virgins on the campus and that one member grew sick and dropped out and the other flunked out i also explained that the reason howards wall clocks always differed as to time of day was because every time a virgin at howard passes a clock the clock stands still within  minutes after that class was over the chairman of my department was calling me in excitedly to say that the dean had said that a student had said that  had said that i was the only virgin on howards campus the superiors then proposed to observe my classes and when i refused this unique attention threatened to fire me but backed down when i remarked during the hearing that i had once been the best cottonpicker in creek county oklahoma and that should it ever come to that i could always burn my doctorate and go back to picking cotton after the hearing they sent a letter reappointing me mainly because as they later said  in court they feared student disruptions should they fire me during the school year but they nonetheless persisted in threats and harassment warning that if i did not fall in line there was going to be a war late one evening after a heated confrontation with a superior  ducked into a middleclass bar near the campus where i encountered a number of older professors their plights surprised and horrified me i decided from then on that if there was going to be a war then i was a soldier and should act like one meanwhile students had been staging protests for grievances which typify universities everywhereagainst curfew regulations and other aspects of the right not to be treated as children the law school students were prominent here led chiefly by jay greene later expelled and now on scholarship in the yale law school and art goldberg a jewish student from berkeley now in rutgers law school their activities consisted mainly of rallies where jay greene and other students would rap to a crowd of several hundred then read resolutions drawn up in legal language and the crowd after being told that the resolutions were to be delivered to president nabrit would joyfully clap their hands and disperse nabrit practically never acted on the resolutions except for a few faint promises even when he was on campus but the procedure was always repeated anyway simultaneously there arose a hybrid political partyprotest group called the student rights oragnization inspired in part by art and jay i accepted the invitation to be its faculty advisor sros membership covered the political waterfront their leaders mainly the editors and feature writers on the hilltop staffwhich later was to prove invaluable  regarded themselves as black militants in the responsible sense of the category and had as their heroes the national leaders of sncc though their own style approximated more the style of national core when un ambassador to the un arthur goldberg exboss of nabrit came to howard sro staged a walkout in which i was able to persuade five other professorsall white of courseto take an active part shortly after that some sro members dissatisfied with the moderation of its leaders came to me late february by now with a plan to form a black_power committee they were all freshmen largely unknown on campus except in their dormitories and among their classmates and accordingly asked my aid in composing and reading at a press conference a sort of black university manifesto we called for the complete revamping of negro colleges as they now exist spoke against the emerging desire to make negro colleges predominantly white and generally setting forth a program for transforming negro colleges into black universities with relevance to the black community and its struggle against white racism and imperialism cultural or otherwise this kicked off an onslaught of student demonstrations with now and again some faculty participation and the first real confrontation between howard students and an oppressive administration a rumor grew prevalent on campus that i was going to be eased out in the summer and by midapril it had slipped into television and radio broadcasts one night on the way to my population class i encountered a number of students who inquired anxiously whether the rumor was true i assured them that no such word had come down to me and that the deadline for nonrenewal of twoyear contracts december  already had passed inside the classroom i sensed the downcast spirit of the students brought up the rumor and suggested that if there was a howard in september i would very well be there all at once they burst into applause but i knew even then that probably i was passing through my last days at howard and perhaps as a college professor anywhere student uprisings rocked on including a confrontation with a police riot squad behind a girls dormitory the sponsorship of a black is best lecture by heavyweight champ muhammad ali after the administration closed down the auditorium leroi jones in a reading to frequent applause of some of his cathartic poetry on the steps of the school of religion the breaking up of a hearing in which naturallook homecoming queen robin gregory was being tried ostensibly because she had helped me and student huey labrie read the black_power committees manifesto and the interruption of selective service boss general hersheys speech eventually students hanged hershey nabrit and dean frank snowden in effigy and followed this with a successful boycott of classes curiously planned for one day only and reportedly representing efforts on the part of moderate student leaders to grab the protest ball from the black_power committee by now we were nearing final exams and it was decided to wrap up protest until the following fall although a series of six mysterious fires which may or may not have been connected with student activities broke out on campus during the last week or so of school one of them causing a general emptying of the administration building school closed and in the dead of early summer about  students and six professors received registered letters of dismissal the manner of selecting the victims was indicative of the general confusion hysteria and inefficiency of the adminstrators who held several  ? private meetings with student spies and faculty informants there were no hearings for dismissed faculty members or students amounting to a direct denial of due process and the chance to confront accusers violating the first and fifth amendments of the constitution of the united states true some middlelevel administrators including clyde ferguson dean of the law school and frank snowden dean of the college of liberal arts went on record as opposing the dismissals dean snowden who reluctantly signed the letters dismissing the professors and who up to that time had risen from one of the favorite howard professors of the late forties to the most hated administrator wrote two letters both prior to the close of school opposing the dismissals one of dean snowdens letters to acting president wormley pleaded in part    serious anxiety will arise among other faculty members as to the good faith of the university  i believe that the whole matter should be reconsidered before any announcements are made    because there seems to me to be a strong possibility that the contemplated action may result not only in serious harm to the universitys position in the academic community but also in creating obstacles for our recruitment of faculty in the future  more obnoxious by anybodys 
the man who cried i am
 i have often said before to the point of repetition cramps criticism of writine by afroamericans is and should bethe responsibility of afroamerican critics not that black critics are more perspective or analytical or for that matter better writers of criticism but white critics have not in the past as in the present been able to explain or translate black literature accurately this is not heresy but fact and the few reviews that were written by whites of john a williams the man who cried l am little brown  support this statement explicitly most good fiction borders on truth iey it is a reflection of the truth if newark and detroit of  had not happened one could have in all likelihood read mr williams book with less fear and indeed could have smiled at the uncommon ending one could have contentedly put the book aside as an excellent work of fiction and of course recommended it to friends and associates you know like we recommended the stranger portrait of the artist as a young man black boy et cetera et cetera one could have suggested this book with the same ease and delight as one suggested the early john coltrane however the summer of  was not fiction therefore it added a new dimension to this novel the dimension of prophesy as with black music black literature continues to grow extend and ceases to be invisible our literature now cuts and you do bleed mr williams

was so hot that summer that the air stood still and i had trouble breathing sometimes i would sit on the front porch and breathe slowly i felt as if i were breathing the same air over and over again i turned two shades darker that summer i almost got as black as miss mabel the grownups said it wasnt really the temperature it was the humiditywhatever that is anyway it was a blistering hot summer and i hated it our house was probably the hottest one in town we didnt own it or anything like that we only rented three rooms of it miss mabel and her two children mike and jim lived upstairs over us mike was  and i think jim was a year younger mike was dark like his mother and jim was almost white looking some of the folks in the neighborhood said that jims father was a white man i dont know anything about that i never saw mikes or jims father mr frank and his wife miss sally lived upstairs on the other side of the house tina their daughter was about the same age as mike and jim the three of them were always hanging around together since i was only seven at the time they didnt want me around in the first week of june miss ruth moved into the downstairs apartment on tinas side of the house i was happy because miss ruth had a daughter janice and i just knew she was going to play with me janice was much closer to my age than the others besides the others swore in blood that they wouldnt play with her naturally i thought she didnt have anyone to play with except me well it didnt turn out that way janice didnt want to play with anyone she was a reader and every time i turned around she was reading her father was a soldier mike said he was in saigon i dont remember the last names of any of the people who lived in the old house we were told to put mr or miss before the first names of grownups and address them that way we didnt know it was wrong until we had grown older by then it didnt matter everybody thought miss ruth was pretty men liked her they were always coming around to see her there was one who used to come around a lot he was very tallmuch taller than my dad who was five feet ten he had curly hair mama used to say that men like that are blessed with the hair their sisters should have had after all whats good hair to a man curlys yellow skin was smooth and soft looking i always wanted to touch it to see if it were really as soft as it looked one of curlys eyes was smaller than the other when he looked at you it seemed as if one eye was looking at you while the other one was looking at something on the other side of the room i used to hang around waiting for curly sometimes i played jacks on the front porch and watched miss ruth and curly out of the corner of my eye she said he was her cousin but one day i overheard miss mabel tell mama that they were the funniest cousins she had ever seen then she laughed mama shook her head sadly and talked about the lord mama knew all about the lord because she was saved i think she was the only person in the whole house who was saved most of the time curly came to see miss ruth at night he usually  brought a carton of beer with him we would stay up late playing hide and seek and curly would still be around when we went inside once i even saw him leaving miss ruths house early in the morning then for no reason at all mike jim and tina started whispering and giggling every time curly came to the house on that day the game started i dont remember who started it probably mike he was always thinking of things to do anyway i wanted to play too one evening while mama and dad were looking at tv i went out to play on the porch janice was already there she sat in a kitchen chair on her side of the porch her head was buried in a book and her feet were propped up on the bannister i looked at her with envy she had on a pair of old blue jeans which someone had cut off at the knees and a dirty white shirt my mother wouldnt let me wear shorts i sat down on the top step and took a small rubber ball out of my skirt pocket i tossed the jacks on the floor janice didnt pay any attention to me i bounced the ball on the porch several times but she didnt even look up i waited until tina came out hey tina i said will you play jacks with me tina shook her head no why i asked gotta talk to mike she said cant you play until he comes no hes coming now tina said she rushed to the screen door as mike and jim dashed down the steps just one game i begged listen honey tina said turning to face me do you wanna play hide and seek with us tonight sure okay keep quiet when were talking business she said business i mumbled hey you hey girl i said calling to janice i stopped when i saw tinas dirty look and pretended i was talking to myself i picked up my ones i heard the screen door open as i started my twos i glanced up and saw miss ruth standing next to janice mike whistled softly miss ruth smiled as she looked across the porch at us she was a short thin woman just five feet tall in heels and she always wore heels she looked cool in her pink sleeveless dress i smiled at her shyly she looked like a fragile toy like something you would pick up carefully and hold gently with both hands hello she said in a soft voice she always spoke softly around us i mumbled and looked down at her tiny feet hi miss ruth mike said hi tina and jim said at the same time they looked at each other and giggled miss ruth turned away from us and leaned over janice why dont you play with them she asked i wanna read janice said her voice sounded hard compared to her mothers you read too much miss ruth said she put her hand on janices shoulder honey you ought to play with other kids janice didnt say anything she didnt seem to be listening im going to get some beer miss ruth said shouldnt be gone long if curly comes before i get back tell him to wait aw right janice said miss ruth walked down the steps her small hips swayed slightly from side to side i watched her until she disappeared i looked over at tina she was standing in a comer talking to mike and jim i looked at janice she was watching us with strange dark eyes i held the jacks up and beckoned to her but she seemed to be looking through me i threw the jacks on the floor and picked up my threes im glad to see you back from the army front mike chanted i picked up the jacks and stared at him curiously he marched across the porch hey now he continued im glad to see you back from the army front tina put her hands over her mouth and giggled jim laughed out loud something funny was going on as usual i was left out of it hey hey jim said im glad to see you back from the army front janice looked up at mike and then at jim and tina at first she seemed puzzled then mike began to switch his hips the way miss ruth did janices mouth swivelled up until it became very small her eyes narrowed they were almost closed she jumped up from the chair and slammed the door as she went inside the house mike and jim marched over to janices side  of the porch i hesitated only for a few seconds before joining them im glad to see you back from the army front i shouted in a high pitched voice the lights went out in janices living room im glad to see you    i stopped abruptly janices skinny face peered out the window facing the porch she made a fist brought it up to her nose and shook it at me startled and frightened i backed over to our side of the porch jim mike and tina were still chanting when miss ruth and curly walked into the yard curly was carrying a sixpack of beer under his arm his light skin was brightened by his yellow shirt he didnt wear a belt his hips held his brown slacks up and they looked as if they were going to fall down wheres janice miss ruth asked looking around aw she went in mike said miss ruth thanked him with a smile before entering the house she and curly stopped at the door and whispered together for a few minutes afterwards they went inside of the apartment and janice dashed out as quickly as she had dashed inside  mike never stopped when he had a good game going army front was a good game every time one of us marched across the porch janices eyes would get narrow and her mouth would shrink we didnt have to say anything all we had to do was march one afternoon when we were all on the porch mike jumped down the steps and ran down the sidewalk for about a block he turned and marched back toward us he stopped in front of the house and looked around then he marched into the yard and up the steps jim dashed over to janices side of the porch and stepped inside of the screen door he put his left hand on his hips and patted his hair with the other one well hello wife mike said he stopped in front of the screen door tina and i giggled it aint hello wife  i said its hello darling  only white folks talk that way mike said i started to disagree but then i had never heard dad call mama darling maybe mike was right hello wife mike said again im back from the army front jim opened the screen door and stepped out on the porch hello husband he said he put both hands on his hips im glad to see you back from the army front he chanted softly ohhhh tina said running her hand through her short nappy hair oh my hair is so curly so curly janice looked like an animal about to attack i really do have that good stuff tina continued its so curly hey now aint i got curly hair she marched across the porch with mike and jim suddenly i was acting crazy too im glad to see you back from the army front i shouted we thank the lord for your return tina said she threw her hands up in mock prayer oh were so glad to see you back from the army front yes lord were glad to have him back aint we glad to have him back yes lord we is i still love curly hair jim said sadly i just love curly hair do you love curly hair everybody loves curly hair mike said shut up janice screamed throwing her book on the floor shut up you say one more word about my mama whos talking about your old mama mike asked you just say one more word one more word she whimpered and ill knock the shit outta you im gonna tell your mama i said impressed in spite of myself you said a bad word janice enjoyed herself for a few minutes be too late after i knock it outta you im really gonna tell now i said you gonna knock the shit outta me too mike asked he strutted up to janice and pushed his chest out until his body touched hers go on hit me i dare you he said as he looked down into her face hit me hit me i dare you you say one more word about my mama she said we aint talking about your old mama tina said yeah i said drawing courage from the others were just playing a game were just playing army front aint we just playing army front mike thrust his face into janices and laughed im glad to see you    janice grabbed him by the throat he tried to pry her hands away from his neck she wouldnt let go then he hit her in the face she swung at him so hard that they both fell on the floor cmon mike jim shouted get her get her tina shrieked i was shocked mike was on the bottom janice was sitting on his stomach bashing him in the face with her fist jim couldnt stand it any longer he jumped on janices back and pulled her off his brother then tina leaped on janice and the three of them wrestled her janice bit kicked and swung her fist wildly the noise grew louder and i was afraid mama would hear us i backed to our side of the porch and sat down on the top step all at once i looked up and saw mama standing at the screen door she stepped out on the porch her face was wet with perspiration and her stomach stuck out so far that it looked as if she had swallowed a watermelon whats all the noise for she asked crossly tina mike and jim released their hold on janice and stood up i stood up too janice rose slowly her nose was bleeding she wiped her face on the bottom of her blouse we all looked ashamed and guilty the way youre supposed to look when grownups catch you doing something wrong but janice put her hands on her hips and glared at my mother with blood still dripping from her nose she looked as if she were going to attack mama mama looked at her with distaste well mama said she waited for an explanation its all her fault mike said quickly sure was mama i said we was out here playing minding our own business miss dorothy tina said then she starts fighting and carrying on sure did mama she said a bad word i said shes always causing trouble miss dorothy jim said cant nobody get along with her do you know what she said mama i said eagerly  i dont want to hear none of her nastiness mama said you little heifer why dont you stay on your side of the porch if you cant play nice like the others i am on my side janice said if i had spoken that way i would have been whipped dont you talk back to me mama snapped i dont play with children janice closed her mouth tightly even though she was silent she looked defiant mama was furious she couldnt bear to have anyone stand up to her again i was impressed with janice i dont want to hear no more foolishness from any of you mama said i looked away from mama to the other side of the porch and i saw miss ruth peering through the screen door at us i didnt know how long she had been there nor what she had heard my face grew hot with embarrassment and shame for the first time i really began to feel the summer heat miss ruth opened the screen door and poked her head out of it apparently she had been sleeping for she wore a red bath robe which was unfastened she held it together with one hand whats wrong she asked in a soft voice these kids are fighting again mama said she looked at miss ruth as if she were looking at sin itself i done told em i dont want no more of this foolishness if they disturb me with their noise one more time im gonna give every one of them a good whipping no matter who they belong to she looked at miss ruth to see how she would take her threat miss ruth came out on the porch and let the screen door close she put her arm around janice miss dorothy miss ruth said quietly i know you mean well but i dont let no outsiders touch my child if she does something wrong you tell me and ill punish her miss ruth mama lowered her voice to match miss ruths a body cant be everywhere all the time we cant always see the devilment our children start miss ruth smiled faintly thats true miss dorothy she conceded her small mouth lost its softness i try to do right by everybody mama continued when a body sees betty doing wrong they know they can chastise her its gonna be the same for this one here she touched her stomach you do what you think best for your children miss ruth said but nobody better touch my janice why i dont whip her myself i can believe that mama said i suddenly had a vision of miss ruth attacking my mother the way janice had attacked mike could little miss ruth beat up mama or would mama beat up miss ruth what would daddy say when he came home and found that mama had beaten up miss ruth i didnt like what was going on she dont have no bringing up at all mama continued youd rather carry on with that oneeyed boy than to do right by your own child mike exchanged a glance with tina and they laughed jim with his hands jammed in his pockets leaned against the wall i began to feel uneasy and hot i didnt want to play army front any more i just wanted everybody to stop talking dont talk about my mama janice said suddenly her voice was almost a plead see there talking back to her betters already mama said i always say you reap what you sow and somedav this child here is of  gonna pay you back for not doing right by her dont say no more   hush miss ruth said to janice i dont mean no harm mama said but i believe in telling things the way they is now you can live the wild life in this world but youre gonna have to come before the lord in the next one mamas voice rose as she began to feel the spirit miss ruth was speechless everybody was quiet i was getting hotter i felt water running off my back for a minute i was afraid that mama would feel the holy ghost then she would begin shouting and thanking the lord for being good enough to feel the holy ghost ive lived a good life mama continued didnt go running around and carrying on and leaving a child to go every which way dont talk about my mama janice said she was breathing hard now mama looked at her sadly i dont fault the child none its your teachings thats making her what she is look at betty she never talks back knows better than to try it miss ruth glanced at me quickly and i tried to back away from her look dont you say   be quiet miss ruth said harshly then make her shut up janice screamed make her shut her damn mouth miss ruth released her robe and slapped janice across the face bewildered janice backed away from her mother they looked at each other for a long time they looked as if they both were going to cry janices mouth trembled she jumped off the porch steps and ran down the street miss ruth looked at mama with tears in her eyes im sorry she mumbled i dont know whats wrong with me i know better than to fuss with you in your condition i know i aint living right miss dorothy she said but i dont mean no harm i just cant help myself i dont mean to hurt nobody  never hit the child before in my life dont know whats wrong with me pray for me miss dorothy pray for me mama wiped the perspiration off her forehead with the back of her hand ill pray for you she promised i looked around for mike he was whispering something to jim and tina they were probably making up a new game or thinking of new ways to play the old one i didnt want to be with any of them anymore while mama and miss ruth were discussing mamas condition i walked off the porch then mama yelled at me i didnt run or anything i just kept walking down the street betty mama yelled you get yourself on back here i didnt turn around i just kept walking i found janice in the alley about a block from the house she was lying face down in the middle of the street whatre you doing i asked as i walked up to her go away she said i hate you too she looked funny there was dirt and blood all over her face cmon get up im gonna stay here forever she said until i die you gonna get run over i said i dont care i wanna die why i asked who cares she asked i thought about her question for a while i didnt know what she meant by it but i knew that i didnt hate her and i didnt want to make fun of her anymore i    i    care i said cmon janice get up as usual janice didnt pay any attention to me i hate everybody she said i hate mama too im gonna stay here till i die then shell be sorry i was already sorry about everything please get up i said fighting back the tears she wouldnt move i walked over to the sidewalk and sat down i wasnt in any hurry to go home i knew i was going to get it when i got there it wouldnt be any little old slap either besides i knew janice couldnt lie in the street forever people drove their cars through that alley and one way or another they would make her move i sat for a long time thinking about janice miss ruth and mama finally janice got up and came over to the sidewalk she sat down next to me i didnt know why she moved from the street maybe she thought that someone cared after all maybe she just got tired of lying there anyway she moved we sat there for a while longer i didnt look at janice because i didnt want to cry and i think maybe she didnt look at me because she didnt want to cry either 
especially one at a predominantly negro institutionis suspect his intellectual inferiority is assumed if he is writing about negroes his bias is presumed it is a painful jobbut a factthat when a white man studies the culture of negroes his work is sent to another white man for appraisal when a negro writes about negroes his work is sent to three white men what is published and publicized consequently generally repeats whatever white men already believe about the negro what is needed is a negro press a black publisher that will publish and publicize the booklength research of negro scholars i first heard such a request in  after a decade negro educators and businessmen have not taken the first step towards such a company negro publishers of magazines evidence their fears that negroes will not buy scholarly publications for they have concentrated their effort and money on periodicals with popular appeal unfortunately they may be correct langston hughes was among those who  years ago deplored the unwillingness of negroes to buy books hughes of course referred to popular booksfiction and poetry interest in scholarship is even less  faculty negro teachers are needed but the task of securing them is not as simple as might be presumed from listening to the bright young educators who demand a black university let us assume that we are considering establishing a university of  studentssmall by standards of the prestige universities colossal for a negro institution let us also propose one teacher for every  students certainly not a farfetched standard for an ideal institution that amounts to only  teachers plus administrators and secretaries only  but that number will not be found among negroes who earn graduate degrees in  i do not propose to exclude arbitrarily any candidate who lacks a doctorate degree nor do i wish to denigrate the intellectual ability and the enthusiam of people who may apply but desire is not sufficient knowledge and teaching ability are required furthermore because instruction must be provided in all areas of the curriculum even the capable and welltrained instructors must be screened to make certain that their qualifications are supplementary rather than duplicating for instance it is useless to have four teachers welltrained in zoology if there is no one sufficiently trained in botany since sufficient teachers cannot be secured from new graduates not already committed to particular institutions it will be necessary to raid the faculties of established institutions as anyone knows who has tried it money does not always prove sufficiently strong to pry a teacher from an institution and a community where he has planted roots for himself and his family in time a new institution with sufficient money and satisfactory fringe benefitssuch as geographic location adequate library limited teaching load and cultural activitiescan build as satisfactory a faculty as did duke and chicago to name only two institutions which competed successfully with wellestablished institutions but time is required a decade may not be an unreasonable minimum meanwhile it may be necessary to develop the program at an institution already established for one may strengthen a competent faculty more quickly than create a new one naturally the institution must be selected carefully and means must be devised to exclude from the programor at least minimize the influence oftenured faculty members who apathetic incompetent or hostile cannot contribute wholesomely administration negro administrators have been criticized for incompetence autocratic behavior and egocentricity although the charges are often justifiable competent administrators can be secured from among those already in higher education like teachers however administrators may be unwilling to abandon established posts to gamble with uncertainty i cannot easily condemn a manblack or white who hesitates and finally refuses to dedicate himself to a cause which may require his sacrificing everything which he has spent a lifetime building perhaps therefore the proposed program should be placed under the jurisdiction of a president who has demonstrated excellence at an institution already established before rejecting this suggestion let us examine the major objectionsthat is the criticisms traditionally hurled at negro administrators autocrats have governed and do govern some negro colleges but the negro race owns no monopoly on tyrannical presidents autocratic administration may develop wherever a weak insecure faculty surrenders its rights there is little need to fear that autocratic practices will govern the ideal black university first the president will already have demonstrated excellence competent administrators recognize that educational programs work best when the faculty assists in determining policy second the strong faculty required for the ideal institution will not surrender its rights negro administrators also are accused of incompetence again the failing should not be identified with a particular race incompetent white men preside over colleges just as incompetent negroes do conversely many negroes administer programs effectively just as white men do the fact that some presidents have proved to be incompetent merely emphasizes the need to select a president carefully some men cannot cope with the rapid expansions of colleges today for example an administrator who has governed successfully as a fatherinresidence for a family of five hundred students and seventy teachers may learn that his methods fail when the population doubles traditionally ministers and professors have been selected as presidents of negro colleges ministers are presumed competent to guide the moral as well as the intellectual development of students it is further assumed that brilliant professors can reshape the curriculum imaginatively and can stimulate academic performance characteristic of their own work the fact is however that the complexity of college administration today requires the talents of a corporation executive rather than those of a scholar or a spiritual counselor higher education is big  business some key administrator on the campus must know how to secure grants how to organize staff how to handle personnel how to prepare and present budgets and proposals in short someone must know how to operate a big business successfully ideally therefore some top administratora vicepresident perhapsshould be experienced in business management but how many negroes have been given the opportunity to exercise their talents as executives in large corporations whereas some white colleges may complain that they cannot find business executives willing to accept lower salaries as vicepresidents negro colleges must complain of the scarcity of negroes with sufficient executive experience to serve even as visiting consultants an ideal institution needs a triumvirate of key administrators one man experienced in managing a corporation who manages the operation a second man  an imaginative scholarwho spearheads the academic program a third man knowledgeable about budgets taxes and law who serves as financial officer naturally as a scholar i would name the academic man to the post of president each of the three however is essential to a successful operation and each must find sufficient prestige and satisfaction in his own position that he will not seek to usurp the responsibilities of the other two new programs and experimentation the new courses proposed earlier do not complete the academic reforms which are needed new curricula must prepare negro students for occupations previously closed to them many predominantly negro colleges starving financially cannot afford the additional expense of new programs no matter how desirable they may be for example if only five students seek training for college personnel positions an impoverished institution may argue that it cannot afford to offer such a program instead it will continue to prepare the fifty students interested in elementary and secondary school counseling thus colleges economically forced to perpetuate the traditional fail to prepare negro students for new occupations the black university may suffer similar financial hardships yet it must offer new programs otherwise it will betray its students and in fact may lose prospective students to larger universities which can afford such programs the black university also must discard the characteristic conservativism of most negro institutions fearing criticism for failure negro institutions rarely have gambled on educational experiments many of the socalled experiments in curriculum and method merely revive antiquated and abandoned practices or these experiments abandon academic standards under the pretext of respecting the socalled culture of the negro experimentation must be encouraged there should be experiments in methods of teaching experiments with nongraded courses experiments with tutorial sessions but experiments must be conducted systematically control groups should be compared with the experimental groups and student performance should be tested and evaluated always the experiment should be designed to discover the most effective means of achieving desired results never merely to confirm the validity of a predetermined hypothesis possibly experimentation will prove that many students cannot reach the required level of competence within four years if so the students must be retained longer college education thus will not be envisioned as four years of courses producing a diploma as automatically as nine months of development produce a child instead it should be viewed as the movement toward a goal the duration determined by the knowledge stamina and quickness of the student the need for new programs and experimentation is a problem for all of higher education not merely for negro institutions i must reemphasize however that the term experiment or curriculum development should not mask a condescending acceptance of inadequate performance by negroes for example some educators currently advise teachers to respect the dialect and the culture of negro students since no studies have determined what that dialect is some educators would accept all habits of language usage no matter how far they deviate from the standard since studies do not describe the negros culture some educators excuse irresponsibility for example as characteristic of that culture such permissiveness further injures the negro student who after graduating seeks a professional or technical position the professional world expects that college graduates will use language identified with professional people and that they will demonstrate responsibility for example few employers will hire secretaries who will say i aint got none of them whether the secretary speaks with the accent of boston or charleston does not matter but the employer expects a different level of usage the employerblack or whitedoes not care whether the secretarys parents and friends speak that way he assumes that if she wishes to retain that pattern of usage she should work among them rather than impose her dialect on his business similarly no one whether a white man or a raceproud black manwants an irresponsible doctor or even an irresponsible plumber theatre music art the black university should provide a training ground for young actors playwrights composers musicians and artists no theatre today provides adequate opportunity for struggling actors and playwrights to develop their talents once again the problem is not restricted to the negro a young white playwright experiences equal difficulty in gaining experience by staging his dramas we are concerned however with the development of negro artists an adequately financed university should be able to maintain a resident company of young writers and performers who could share with students their professional experiences limited though they may be and who would have a stage on which to develop their talent similarly the black university must house a substantial collection of works by negro writers and scholars and a museum of art by black men both collections require money and the services of fulltime directors who have time and travel expenses to search for the necessary materials the resident company the library and the museum can be established and maintained as easily at a predominantly negro institution already established as at a new institution trustees if i seem indifferent to trustees the reason is only that as a teacher and quasi or semiadministrator i have considered trustees only as businessmen who give the blessing of the practical world to the dreams of educators i foresee less difficulty in securing trustees than in securing anything else for the black university jackie robinson ralph bunche mayor carl stokes of cleveland or mayor richard hatcher of gary publisher john h johnsonthese are only a few who are possible trusteesallblack or allnegro or allafroamerican or whatever you wish to call those peoplecan be found prestige the final need of the black university is for prestige even newly established white institutions require time to build reputations but i fear that in america a black university will never earn national reputation as long as it uses only black teachers to instruct only black students and i wonder how long negro students will retain pride in their institution unless that pride is respected by nonblacks this is perhaps the final reason reaffirming for me my original conclusion that the desired results may be obtained more effectively by building upon an already established predominantly negro university rather than attempting to establish a new institution secure the necessary money whether from black men or white men and add this to the money already in the budget of a school secure administrators whose talents supplement those of a competent administrator who already has experience secure teachersblack or whitewho have the knowledge and the ability to teach the desired courses and use them to strengthen a staff which already has numbers and competence accept students white or blackwho wish to experience the education provided then revise the curriculum to meet the needs and demands what results will not be the black university for it accepts white money white faculty and white students but it should be the kind of institution best designed to provide adequate opportunity for black teachers and students to develop their capabilities fully to serve the black community effectively to gain pride in and knowledge of their heritage and themselves and to achieve recognition for their ability and these after all are the major purposes for which a black university is proposed 
standards were the methods of selecting dismissed individuals dr nabrit saidall the people have uniformly said weve used the scholarship methodweve read in the paper somewhere rightly or wrongly that these people were in some way associated with the disturbance and thats a scholastic way to approach the situation george hayes howard attorney assumed a lawyer calhoun demeanor and wailed that there has been a suggestion of black powwuh delivered in the baptist preachers fireandbrimstone tones he further insinuated that i had caused the fires reading a statement from an article on howard i had

two wellknown novels about the racial scene in a confidential report to his superior the associate dean of students carl anderson set forth ludicrous and needless to say erroneous conclusions based on the viewing of a film by  members of the staff and two students employed as spies the film of a hershey hearing had been turned over to howard by a local television  station whose white reporter had gotten into an argument with black militant students outside the building and was knocked down and hospitalized the trouble with this was that the howard investigators had a film with no sound consequently they watched anthony gittens in the room legitimately as a witness and jay greene who sought to bring the militant crowd under control and concluded from that that they were inciting the crowd to rebellion the confidential report also erroneously declared the black_power committee under the control of sncc and the communist party and labeled the father of one student a communist the report listed the names of  members of the black_power committee only one of them was actually a member one student who was listed as a member art goldberg was white from this kind of evidence an ad hoc kangaroo disciplinary committee of  faculty officials meted out punishment from dismissals to warnings and dormitory purges to  students including andre mckissick daughter of cores floyd mckissick faculty members dismissed were merely outspoken faculty members whose contracts conveniently expired that year they had violated the cult of mediocrity originated in howards early years when christian character and republican principles were just as political docility is now the prime prerequisites for employment and promotion the only other accusations aside from acting president stanton l wormleys labeling of me and prof ivan eames as fellow racists came from president nabrit who was almost never on campus who said that there had been shovings and some kind of physical contact these teachers had been involved in this kind of activity this of course was a baldfaced lie in the recent months four additional professors of unquestioned professional performance have been refused reappointment apparently for political views more retaliations are to come with each years expiration of contractsas things now standuntil all persons of a divergent political hue have left in disgust or been dismissed when news of last summers firings reached me i had been lecturing at the university of wisconsin at milwaukee after some weeks i returned to washington and suggested in passing when responding in the local press to nabrits boasts of his past civil_rights legal work that at least now having outlived his usefulness after serving well in his day and receiving his reward he should have the decency to get out of the way i left town again shortly and nabrit who had one year left before reaching the mandatory retirement age and who had spent half of the previous year officially working away from howard as a salesman of lbjs foreign policy announced his retirement i was sitting at a conference breakfast table when i read this in the washington post and i immediately exclaimed to my companions that it was a propaganda a public relations stunt my skepticism was based in part on long exposure to the conniving dishonest approach of the howard administration later i was to learn that howards public relations director who highlighted the hershey affair when the selection of student defendants clearly indicated that the black_power committee was the target had received a special citation from the american association of college public relations officials he also played up the black_power issue after the firing of six professors four of them white and i the only black_power advocate in the six unfortunately a group of dismissed students and faculty members misread nabrits resignation as did just about everybody else and called a press conference to announce it as a victory for our cause they also suggested kenneth b clark a member of howards board of trustees as a successor to nabrit which caused me to exclaim unconsciously aloud as soon as i had read it i was aware that if you write a book called tan ghetto people will think you moderate dark ghetto a militant and black ghetto a flaming radical hence it did not surprise me a few paragraphs later when i read that clark had denounced our movement as psychotic while commending the ways of nabrit in september nabrit was to announce that he had never written a letter of resignation and would not indeed that he might defy the mandatory rule and stay on several years then the day after the first fight of my current boxing comeback in december in which i won by a knockout in  minutes and  seconds of the first round nabrit announced in the press for the second time that he would not retire we went to court in augusti belatedly and reluctantly for i felt that that would turn the matter over to the mercy of the great white courts which might rule on a legal technicality rather than on pure justice also howard students and teachers should any still care or remember by september would tend to accept the courts decision as infallible or equally as bad await it passively our lawyers assured us that the case would be over by september and i felt i had to go along because other faculty members thought that my staying out would hurt their case the judge who handled it an octogenarian had a reputation for conservatism as well as for making the wrong decision in the opinion of the courts of appeals where the case is now we did not therefore expect a favorable decision and time and again during the courtroom proceedings the biased and illogical comments of the elderly judge brought down the courtroom in laughter i discovered meanwhile that the members of the black_power committee had been imprisoned in a summer riotprevention roundup of black militants in this case for conspiring to incite a riot as bail money could not be raised for them at the time they could not return to howard this left me standing on the battlefield with no forces and so i worked along with other student leaders who planned a boycott for september i also remembered all the help local black leadersnot to mention howard students and professorsunsolicited by mehad promised throughout the preceding year and i planned at last to solicit their aid however student leaders were strongly against outside forces then just before school started the students were reinstated though most of them went elsewhere generally to better schools one of them is said to have told the other students to work on forming a student judiciary committee instead of risking protest i personally heard a dismissed professor discourage rebellion before he left for another college student leaders and professors posing as militants echoed this advice now students who previously had urged me not to round up and bring in outside forces informed me that there would be no boycott and suggested that i use the outside forces they had just learned that members of the black_power committee which had stolen the campus leadership from the liberalmoderate student establishment the year before were now away in jail at about this time the local affiliates of newarks national black_power conference formed a washington committee for black_power of which i was elected chairman i sought help with the howard movement from them and from other black militants but none came forward nor did any black group raise funds or contribute to the bill for court costs although some area white professors held a fundraising party and some american university students held a fundraising concert howard students did nothing along these lines although the militants put on a party to raise bail money for a person never connected with howard and who had in fact help persuade the washington committee for black_power to evade the howard struggle on the formal opening of howard a walkout was planned by militant students for president nabrits address only three professors again all whitecould be persuaded to take an active part keith lowe harvardtrained english professor who had been part of the summers purge stood with me on the sidewalk to greet students and faculty members walking out of the auditorium as students gathered round and cheered the voice of professor lowe an oriental reared in jamaica grew hoarse as he implored i have seen you act as full human beings    dont let your struggle slip back i warned the students that the only hope is to close howard down indefinitely until a ruthless helterskelter administration buckles under in repentance i did not know that that also had been the view of mordecai johnson former president of howard when the congressional appropriations committee attemped to suppress academic freedom at howard early in the mccarthy era but as in the case of last years boycott student militants mistakenly seeking wide participation had turned the leadership of the protest over to establishment students i know now that the major reason for the black_power committees relative strength last year rested in its exclusiveness although this angered many students who regarded themselves as black radicals and had reputations for constant espousals of the glory of blackness and revolutionary rhetoric these students may still be found at this game beating their chests and reading and parroting frantz fanon and maotse tung and it is clear now that they cannot be expected to do much else then there are the grand organizers i recently attended a unifying meeting of the representatives of  different groups each proposing to have the cure for howards ills when i finally left the meeting at midnight they had not managed to get together on anything other than the prohibition of campus activity by any single membergroup later  learned that they agreed on a collective name whose acoustics formed an african word but they have done nothing since which rememberis what they agreed that no membergroup should do anything this nothingness pervades the air at howard although steve abel student chairman of the united black peoples party appears to try hard and to mean business but he has little or no help and freshman class president michael harris who has much promise but has not yet had the time to lose his faith in the lies and promises of howards administration and establishmentstudent leaders did stage a sitin in president nabrits office protesting compulsory rotc against abels will the  students were persuaded by establishmentleaders to break up the sitin on the promise that nabrit would eliminate compulsory rotc this promise may  yet be fulfilled but in any case at best it is a paper victory in more than one sense of the word understand me there still are maybe  truly militant students left at howard which would be enough to detonate the movement should they ever manage to shake off the control of the administrations student flunkies studentlounge radicals and other phonies adrienne manns editor of the hilltop for example has done a brilliant job along with anthony gittens chairman of project awareness in making students aware also it is said that time makes more converts than reason and it may come to pass that the next time nabrit announces his retirement howard students  per cent of whom oppose his administration according to a hilltop survey may have the courage to run him out of town as of this writing the atmosphere at howard appears to the casual visitor to loom thick with the sickness of a strange and eerie apathy administrators cling to the erroneous notion that a university can stand upon guns cunning and connivance unwary it seems of the fact that history is a vengeful lady and when once it retaliates can be a vicious executioner students and professors walk around virtually wrapped in a cautious trance as if ready to run at the sound of boo some wear the faces of grinning mummies hucklebucking no less in mock glee in and out of the punch out and other student hangouts i walk through the campus on occasion and now and again students wave or grin at me or come over to shake my hand and to inquire about my welfare and it saddens me to see that they are not concerned about their own it is sadder still to see in their faces and reactions and frequently frank apologies and rationalizations a recognition that they have played into the hands of dishonesty and disgrace to their own heritage bartered away selfrespect for insulation against the risk of delay or inconvenience in getting themselves ratified no pun intended for the rat race they feel lies ahead some of them may never realize how cheaply they sold out but students unlike professors are not stuck forever in the cesspool of howards mediocrity many will be able to shake off the crippling influences of their college years and someday reclaim their lives elsewhere and make full contributions to the world and to their race the professors who remain must either face dismissal or be left to quiver aimlessly in the quicksand of induced docility i have watched them day by day young professors with style and promise already losing their spark grumbling in the dark but falling silent and teethy when administrators walk by old men now dissatisfied but powerless at this late date to move driven to drink in bars near the campus discussing the books begun five to  years ago which their frozen pens will now never finish the day before christmas eve i stopped by an asylum to visit a former howard professor and friend incarcerated there he had been one of the deans of negro literature and black thought in the days when howard was in its heyday sought out for guidance by a generation of black students when howards faculty directory read like a whos who among negro scholars in late november someone had told me how he stood in a faculty meeting and angrily threatened should howard go through with a proposal to give all this years honorary degrees to white individuals he would write exposes which would make nathan hares seem mild within two weeks they compelled him to retire leave of absence beginning the second semester until the end of the year and then goodby after over thirty years on the faculty in a few days he was taken by force to st elizabeths hospital coming down the corridor on the day of my visit he looked well for his age and in good health on approaching closer he recognized me and refused to see me stating that he did not wish to see anybody from howard again i am glad i was a howard professor but i also am glad that howard fired me 
penniless writer he travels the gamut from beans and ham hocks to plush meals in europe he leaves the negro paper for a more profitable position on a liberal white one his published novels become a measured success so successful that one eventually goes into paperback he joins the white house staff as a speech writer for a kennedytype president and leaves unhappily because the president doesnt use any of his speeches he emasculates his manhood through his relationships with black and white women and soon becomes a carboncopy of that white boy lillian patch who is killed because of an abortion was of course the prototype of the negro professional woman one who had acquired all the white values of her society and who wished to live those values lillian and max would have gotten married had max had a better paying job and had he moved more swiftly into the american mainstream max made the mistake of letting lillian wear the pants and in effect lost himself and lillian after a short depression period brought on by the death of lillian max is regenerated through a job with the new york centurya liberal white paperand the publication of his third novel after a successful stay at the century max leaves and joins pace a timestyle magazine and works his way up to chief of its african bureau the scene of the novel shifts from the united states to africa and europe while in africa we learn such things as the truth about the african slave trade that black africans own a very small percentage of their land that the black masses of south africa with its own system of apartheid have a higher standard of living than the masses of africans in other areas of the continent we learn that the majority of black leaders in the independent nations of africa are just as devious selfish and prowestern as the black middleclass in the united states in europe we have glimpses of jeanpaul sartre albert camus and the whole frenchblack intellectual association as in the europe of hemingway pound eliot joyce and fitzgerald black writers are not wanted or needed finally while we are in europe we come to the revolutionary discovery of the king alfred contingency plan for the detention and systematic extermination of the afroamerican people while attending the funeral of harry ames max is given this highly secret information by harrys white mistress as max reads the letter from harry explaining the plan his physical pain cancer of the rectum leaves him and is replaced with the pain of knowing too much and we share this pain as max reads panic in washington ensued when it was discovered that jaja not only had information on the alliance but on king alfred the contingency plan to detain and ultimately rid america of its negroes mere american membership in the alliance would have been sufficient to rock america but king alfred would have made negroes realize finally and angrily that all the new movesthe laws and committees to gain democracy for them were fraudulent just as minister q and the others have been saying for years your own letter to me days after you left the white house only underscored what so many negro leaders believed the one alternative left for negroes would be not only to seek that democracy withheld from them as quick and as violently as possible but to fight for their very survival king alfred as you will see leaves no choice have black people ever had a choice no yet the new york times reviewer said of the king alfred plan   here believability falters the saturday review adds to white americas illusions with the assertion it reads rather like an antiwhite protocols of the elders of zion the nation said of the contingency it is an unlikely possibility that deflects attention from the ways power and prejudice actually work inevitable black genocide is a risky thing to  base your whole vision upon a white critic reviewing a black book feels that the king alfred contingency plan is not only fiction but borders on science fiction were detroit and newark fiction were the deaths of three college students in south carolina two shot in the back fiction is the formation of one thousand vigilantes posse in chicago to fight off rioters fiction and what about the purchasing of armored cars mace an eyeirritating nauseous gas banana peel a chemical that makes a street too slippery to walk on polycarbonate riot shields grenade launchers for gauge shotguns and other weapons by city and state governments one can go further even after reading the socalled scholarly criticism in transaction and refer to the report from iron mountain the report not only legitimizes war but suggests that the government reconsider the reintroduction of slavery another possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction in some form consistent with modern technology and political processes of slavery as a black writer i can look at the man who cried i am from a different perspective and indeed see king alfred being implemented today no doubt about it mr williams can write he proved that with night song and sissie but the williams of this novel transcends the artist and becomes the seer the prophet one of the poor points of the book was the authors main characters consistent relationship with white women max and harry had white wives and max forever wanted a redhead when will we stop hating ourselves and start loving our own women as one black woman put it williams makes a fool of himself in this respect i guess he couldnt write any other way since he has one for a wife it is interesting to note that the black man will share his hard times with the black woman but when it comes to fame and fortune it looks better with a white woman at his side williams is ambiguous when he states that it was one thing to sleep with white women but quite another to marry them yet the two main figures in his novel had white wivesa part of being accepted i guess after seriously thinking about the ending for some time my conclusion is that it could happen    mainly because we know for a fact that black fbi and cia agents do exist they are being used today in africa and in the black communities of the united states as for the minute transatlantic call max makes to minister q malcolm_x to tell about the king alfred contingency i regard it as extreme stupidity but then again what else would a negro do max as king negro had in actuality lost meaningful contact with his people he had left home a long time ago and had no intention of coming back if max had been in tune he would have had brothers in europe who would have helped him the value of this novel cannot be measured in terms of copies sold or reviews written to date it has not sold as well as confessions of nat turner for obvious reasons and most of the major white critics completely overlooked it this i believe is an indication of its importance ramparts magazine called it the toughest novel of the fall and ran an excerpt in its december  issue this too indicates its value for this is the first time if i am not mistaken that a novel by an afroamerican has been excerpted in a major white publication yes john a williams has written a dangerous novel and when the order comes down from the regime that books with dangerous teachings should be publicly burnt the man who cried am will start the firedon l 
justed for price changes in  dollars so they show the actual situation for all families during the sixties the data on family income are related to the number of persons within the family who are producing an income in  more black than white families had two or three persons within the family bringing home paychecks but still a black family with three persons bringing home a salary median income of  made less than a white family with just one earner  between  and  median family income for blacks went up from  to  and from  to  for whites in statistical terms the median income for black families increased by  percent while the increase for white families was  percent consequently black families made  percent as much as white families in  and  percent as much as white families in  it would appear from these figures that black families were overtaking white families in their quest for a more equitable share of the nations resources but if you look at the statistics again and do a little calculating you will see that in  a white family made  more than a black family and in  white families made  more than black families the data show  continued from page  clearly then that in relative terms black families are overtaking whites but in absolute terms the situation is getting worse one of the most profound and perplexing problems which has plagued the black community for generations has been the conflict between males and females the income picture for persons as differentiated from families shows one underlying aspect of this conflict between  and  median income for black males  years and older increased from  to  and for white males from  to  the percentage increase in the median income of the black male was  percent as compared to a  percent increase for the white male in  a black man made  percent as much as a white man and in  he made  percent as much in actual dollars the black man made  less than a white man in  and  less in  just as it was in family income the relative situation for the black man improved between  and  while the absolute situation declined of even greater interest to our understanding is that higher levels of education did not significantly improve the relative or absolute situation of the black man in  a black man with eight years of school made  percent as much as a white man with a similar education a black high school graduate made  percent as much as a white man with a high school diploma and a black man who had some college made  percent as much as a white man with some college in actual dollars this meant that in  a black man with an elementary school education made  less than a white a black with four years of high school made  less and a black man with some college made  less in  a black man with elementary school education made  percent as much as a white the high school graduate made  percent as much and the black man who went to college made  percent as much and in actual terms the income differences were    and  less respectively as we indicated earlier the picture is a confusing one but let us summarize the income situation of the black man in  as compared to  and black men as compared to white men in  black men had a higher median income than in  and this was true at all educational levels in  the relative situation between black and white men had improved at all educational levels but the absolute situation had improved only for black men with eight years of education it had worsened for those with high school diplomas or who had attended college furthermore the relative situation had improved least and the absolute situation dedined worst for those who had college training this means that at the higher educational levels white men are moving so rapidly in america that black men at the same levels are barely keeping up the situation for black women for the same period of time and in the same age category is quite different median income for black women went up from  in  to  in  and for white women the change was  to  respectively in relative terms the income of black women increased by  percent and that of white women by  percent so that while black women made  percent as much as whites in  they made  percent as much in  in  black women made  less than whites and  less in  therefore in both relative and absolute terms the income situation for black women has improved since  the nature of the relative and absolute improvement is seen more clearly when we analyze changes by educational levels in  a black woman with eight years of school made  percent as much as a white woman with similar education a black woman with a high school diploma made  percent as much as a white woman and a black woman with some college made  percent as much as a white woman with similar education by  a black woman with eight years of school made  percent as much as a white woman a black woman with a high school diploma also made  percent as much and a black woman with some college made  percent more than a white woman with similar education median income for a black woman with some college education in  was   more than the median income of the white woman with similar education  although the data on income trends for blacks is confusing we believe several conclusions are justified in terms of family income the black population has made some relative improvements in the sixties but our absolute situation has remained virtually the same if we remember that it takes at least three earners in a black family to produce a median family income anywhere close to that of a white family with one earner we can certainly say there has been no improvement in the income situation of the black family we have to work three times harder and we still do not keep up with the majority of americans when we consider income of persons it is apparent as it has long been apparent that the black female is much more capable of matching and exceeding her white counterpart than is the black male furthermore while black females with higher levels of education exceed white females  black males with higher levels of education fall further behind white males this economic picture aggravates so many of the subtle psychological problems facing the black family and the relations between black men and women earlier we pointed to two contradictory trends in the black population during the sixties the general social and economic picture of black families in the cities gives some foundation to the belief of some experts that black people may be moving in two directions recent special censuses in many of the major cities of the country are showing that since  there has been relatively little improvement for many black families and in some cases a reversal in our situation in many cities the unemployment rates for blacks have been virtually the same throughout the sixties there has been no improvement in family income and often there is a rise in the proportion of families which are headed by women a notable example is the hough area of cleveland where the male unemployment rate was virtually unchanged from  to  and family income declined by  percent the situation is not getting worse for all black people in major cities however and the trends bear very close observation and cautious interpretations there is no doubt that a larger black middleclass is coming into existence and there are some who would hold that these blacks are better off but we must ask better off in relation to what are they better off in relation to their previous situation in relation to lowincome blacks or in relation to whites in the same areas in which they live some limited data from cleveland provide us with some tentative answers to what may be happening to black people in various parts of the large cities of the nation while most of clevelands black population is generally found in nine neighborhoods some black people live outside of these areas in  some  percent of the black people in cleveland lived outside of the black community area and in   percent of the black people lived outside of this area if we assume that in general those living away from the black community are middleincome people and those within the community lowincome blacks we can compare some of the characteristics of these two groups of blacks and then compare them to middleincome whites in cleveland the table lists some of the social and economic characteristics of these three groups in cleveland for  and  in  middleincome black people had a fertility ratio the number of children under five for every  women aged  much lower than that of lowincome blacks indicating that poor blacks had more children to care for and less money with which to do so than their more prosperous brothers the proportion of children under  living with both parents gives some indication of family stability and here the middleincome blacks were also better off for a higher percentage of their children live in stable families furthermore middleincome blacks had a full year more of completed school than did those in lowincome areas although middleincome blacks have an employment rate lower than that of lowincome blacks both groups have high levels of employment the difference between the two groups is most clearly seen in the income statistics middleincome blacks have a much lower proportion of families and the very low income category and a higher proportion in the category of those families making from eight to fifteen thousand dollars per year therefore the median income of the poor black families was only  percent as much as the median income of the black families living outside of the black community we can confidently say that in cleveland in  middleincome blacks were better off than lowincome blacks by  the fertility ratio for all black families had declined considerably but the middleincome blacks still had much lower fertility than lowincome blacks the proportion of stable families in two communities went in opposite directions it got worse for the low income blacks and better for the middleincome blacks while both groups improved in their educational levels the middleincome blacks improved so much more rapidly that by  they had over one and a half years more of completed education than did lowincome blacks the unemployment picture in  was most interesting for the relationship of the males to each other did not change even though the general rates were lower for both groups the lowincome black women had a higher level of unemployment in  while the unemployment rate for middleincome black women plummeted to below  percent the effect of these diverging trends in female employment is seen in the income data in the lowest income category there has been virtually no change for lowincome blacks and a dramatic improvement for middleincome blacks while both groups saw improvements in the upper income categories there were twice as many middleincome black families making from eight to  per year as there were lowincome blacks consequently the poor black families had a median income only  percent as high as that of their more prosperous brothers a decline from the  situation in  the median income for middleincome black families was  more than it was for lowincome black families and by  it was  more the evidence  suggests that not only were middleincome black people in cleveland better off than lowincome black people in  in the period since  the middleincome blacks were moving further away from lowincome blacks in terms of family organization education employment and income the black population in one of americas major cities is moving in two different directions it appears  given the comparative standing of middle and lowincome black families to each other in cleveland in  and  how do the middleincome black families compare to the white families who live in the same area as they do here we are unable to obtain all the data necessary for comparison like that above and the available data are not as satisfactory as we would wish for there were significant changes in the number of black and white families in the area under consideration while the number of black families living outside of the black community doubled in the five year period an increase of  percent the number of white families declined by  percent apparently as whites moved further away from middleincome black families in  black families in middleincome areas of cleveland had a much higher level of fertility than white families and a much lower level of family stability black people were twice as likely as whites to be unemployed and consequently they had much lower income levels than whites over a fourth of the black families fell into the lowest income category as compared to a fifth of the white families and in the higher income categories the whites consistently outstripped the blacks some rather profound changes had taken place by  the fertility level of the blacks was much closer to that of the whites as a consequence of a slight rise in white fertility and a large drop in black fertility black families were still characterized by more problems than white families however as only  percent of all black youth under  were living with both parents as compared to  percent of the white youth the most significant change was in the unemployment levels black men were still twice as likely as white men to be without employment but black women had a much lower unemployment rate than white women finally there was a considerable equalization in the distribution of families by income levels it is true that more black than white families ? were in the lowest income category but the difference between the two groups was reduced greatly on the other hand the difference in the proportion of families in the highest income category was increased in favor of the whites while in the middlerange categories the black and white families were almost equitably distributed the general point we have been trying to articulate in this discussion of middle and lowincome black families in cleveland and their comparison to white families is in answer to the question if things have been getting better for some black people in the sixties what does getting better mean the data would suggest that middleincome black families are outdistancing lowincome black families in cleveland so in relation to each other the absolute and relative situation of middleincome blacks is getting better and that of lowincome blacks is getting worse however in a comparison of middleincome blacks to whites in the same area the data are suggestive if not conclusive in  middleincome black families were in a rather unfavorable position as compared to white families by  the situation had improved for two possible reasons  many white families had moved out of the city in flight from the influx of black people and those whites who remain behind may fall into the lowest and highest income categories and  black women carried a considerable portion of the incomeproducing activities of black families thus making it possible for their families to exist in some reasonable comparison to the white families who remained in the area the situation for black men as compared to white men had not improved at all it was the continuation of the feminine practice of supporting the family which has apparently made it possible for the black families in cleveland to improve their situation in relation to the white families in this paper we have tried to specify some of the major demographic trends in the black community in the sixties to underscore some of the issues that must be taken into account in the development of a black university the  data indicate that black people are becoming a larger portion of the population in the nations largest cities and we have moved into a situation of influential control in at least one third of the  largest cities other data which we have not discussed here indicate that the blacks moving into the larger cities tend to be young people who are better educated and more likely to engage in whitecollar occupations than the whites who remain in these cities furthermore the data indicate that in the sixties black people have been seeking education more than ever before however in occupations and in employment there has been no substantial improvement for the black population with the exception of some notable changes for black women while black people have shown improvement over previous periods in income in relation to whites in america the situation is not as favorable black men particularly those with higher levels of education are no more able now than they were previously to match white men in income on the other hand black women compare much more favorably with white women in producing incomes and at the higher educational levels black women clearly excel white women in income when we can separate middle and lowincome blacks we see that middleincome blacks are improving their social and economic situation much faster than lowincome blacks thus the two groups are getting further apart and there is evidence that middleincome black families have been able to make gains on middleincome white families but primarily because of the incomeproducing ability of black women a black university must address itself to the changes taking place in the black community and two profound conditions have been presented in this article we must carefully consider the consequences of the fact that in these times the burden of family support still falls heavily upon the shoulders of black women how this affects black men in particular and black families in general must be given very close attention as we attempt to respond to the conditions and needs of the black community secondly we must consider the significance of the split between middle and lowincome blacks that has clearly developed in the sixties it would seem safe to say that many prosperous blacks are being rewarded in this country while many poor blacks are taking to the streets there must be a philosophy and ideology which will unite the black community regardless of economic condition or social status if our prosperous brothers continue to prosper by putting their wives in the labor force and begin to forget it may well be that in the s one century after the emancipation decade of the s we may see the reinstatement of the old houseslave versus fieldslave dichotomy using income education and place of residence as the basis of differentiation lord have mercy 
black art
by jon  lockard
on onye lockard is a selftaught artist a fact which might have something to do with his choice of subjects for as an artist mr lockard is not much concerned about the art class geometries and the delicacy of shadow on a rose his art is directed toward human beings and to delineating their beauty their anguish and their joys the impact of mr lockards work is evident on the next three pages but it is to be regretted that negro digest is unable to reproduce the three paintings in color for colorin more than one senseis most important in mr lockards work the faces and the hands are black very black but touched with that deep umber which suggests the earth and the backgrounds which appear merely dark in black and white are shades of blue red and flameorange in the original mr lockard a detroit native currently lives and works in ann arbor mich where his studio ann arbor art centre  s fourth ave is located he formerly operated studio  in detroit specializing in commercial art and illustrations and attended wayne state university as an art major he now concentrates on portraits color prints of the paintings reproduced here are available through mr lockards studio they are  by  inches in size and sell for  each they also are available framed at additional cost framed  x  prints are available for s the unframed prints also are available at vaughns book store in detroit and at ellis book store in chicago that something is gravely wrong with the conventional approach to the education of black children no longer is arguable much of the problem of course is general there is something gravely wrong with american education period however as always in a society whichbeing racist by natureassigns opportunities and rewards according to race and color those people suffer most who are regarded least and those people in the american society are black people it is a hopeful sign that some of the brightest young people who have chosen education as their profession are deeply concerned about the deficiencies of existing educational institutions particularly as these institutions relate to black students and the communities from which the students come these educators are no longer willingas so many of their predecessors were to sit back comfortably and garner laurels and enjoy status while the talent and potential of the masses of black children are criminally wasted the idea of a black universityan institution designed to serve the real and total needs of the black communityhas taken root and there is every reason to believe that the idea will grow and eventually take concrete shape the special issue of negro digest devoted to a consideration of the concept of the black university developed through discussions with gerald mcworter a recent phd graduate of the university of chicago now an assistant professor of sociology at fisk university in nashville in his outline letter to the other contributors to this special issue of negro digest mr mcworter said that the articles dealing with facets of the proposed black university would concern themselves with a vision the articulation of an ought    for the future    he made it clear that the concept of the black university as envisioned by himself and the editors was concerned with the entire spectrum of social economic psychological and cultural imperatives which characterize influence and control the black community in a further clarification by the editors the black university concept was described as also being concerned with the art of black people and with the development and articulation of a black esthetic it is concerned with the conscious strengthening of those institutions which make the black community viable and it is dedicated to the liberation of black students and black people generally from the inhibiting and crippling presumptions which have been imposed upon black life and culture from outside the black community  the projected special issue on the black university was conceived with five basic articles in mind plus two case studies of existing black educational institutions the proposed areas of concern for the five articles were as follows  the black university toward a conceptual model  policy and support trustees administrations and funding  the academic process faculty students courses research  the black university and its community social change in the sixties and  the international perspective the third world that the articles as presented fall short of the goal set for the special issue of the magazine is testimony more to the inflexible demands of deadlines and the preciousness of time than to any failing on the part of the contributors all educators of the highest competency despite the inadequacy of time however they have presented here an urgent and imaginative educational prospect one which will surely engage black students and educators more deeply in the days to come for their efforts and for their service to the community negro digest is most grateful hoyt w fuller managing editor 
what is this thing called negritude
for africa in particularand for much of the rest of the world in generalthe era of western discovery exploration and occupation constituted a long night of exploitation and domination and while colonialism scourged most of the nonwhite world only the black men from africa were massively enslaved corralled by the millions and transported in chains across the seas to alien lands torn from their roots forbidden access to their cultural sustenance assigned roles as eternal drones the black men from africa drawing from some uncommon racial reservoir nonetheless found the strength and the strategy to endure the long night is now receding before a new dawn but the coming light alone cannot heal the deep affliction induced by the prolonged darkness strong medicine is required to cure the disease of degrada  tion and negritude has been offered as antidote to the ancient evil of antiblack racism it was a group of black intellectuals in paris who first advanced the idea of negritude cesaire aime a poet from the french antilles and leopold sedor senghor a poetstatesman from senegal chief among them senghor now president of the republic of  senegal remains the principal proponent of negritude and he sums it up in these words negritude is the whole complex of civilized valuescultural economic social and politicalwhich characterize the black peoples or more precisely the negro  african world  in other words the sense of communion the gift of mythmaking the  gift of rhythm  a myth which evolves with its circumstances into a form of humanism    united nations president alex quaisonsackey of ghana defines negritude as an acceptance and affirmation of the quality of blackness   a psychological gathering together of all black peoples in the spiritual bonds of brotherhood and american  professor st clair drake terms negritude a soft and resilient rather than a hard and mechanical approach to life  a deep resentment over subordination to white people during the  years of slave trade and the subsequent structuring of caste relations here and in africa i negritude then is also a form of racialismyes but in the words of french philosopher jeanpaul sartre antiracial racialism therein lies the difference and dr drake explains antiracist racialism was brought into view by its opposite which is aggressive exploitative racism and the whole concept of negritude assumes in its dialectic that antiracist racialism is destined to disappear
