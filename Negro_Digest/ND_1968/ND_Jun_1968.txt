if anyone originally y doubted the prospects for success of the old civil_rights movement his initial suspicions have certainly materialized in the events of the last two years the revolutions in the black ghetto the waning influence and effectiveness of oldguard negro spokesmen and the increasing antiblack mood of congressall of these events have signalled the end of an era the old movements engine of change guided as it was by the integrationassimilation school of social engineers is on its way to the junkyard of social movement apparatus and perhaps black historians will render the following autopsy having promised the black community far more than attainable with its ineffective propulsion system the derailed engine of change succumbed to dual assaults from militantly impatient blacks and tenaciously adamant whites sursum corda in spite of the inability of the old engine to muster the powerful propulsion necessary to sustain itself it has nevertheless given birth to forces which look most promising in terms of being capable of moving the black community toward human dignity and respect and a much fuller participation in americas economic and political systems the flames of black consciousness and black identity are spreading through the community like wildfire the new mood symbolized by this refreshing black awareness provides us with clues as to what will be the most effective components in the new engine of change that must be constructed for the next phase of the movement all great social upheavals have had their theorists and indispensable vanguard of intellectuals and the new movement must have a similar core of those who are comfortable in the world of social theory on an organizational level such persons are comparable to engineers whose function it is to ferret out elements in a given problem according to esoteric quantitative methodology and when the appropriate methodology is inadequate such professional engineers create new quantitative frameworks that will aid in the solution of the problem a technical organization without its engineering department is likely to be a shortlived entity doomed to failure because of a predictable lack of imaginative and innovative solutions to its complex technical problems similarly a social movement without its theorists can move only so far before it begins to suffer from lack of spirit and clearly defined goals perhaps much of the problem with the old engine of change was that the avowed goalsintegration now and its accompanying accoutrementswere largely irrelevant to the vast majority of blacks as the old engine creaked along its tracks it became more and more obvious to the black masses that the right to live in suburbia was less urgent than the right to man a decent job wherever that job was located so one extremely healthy result of the derailment of the old engine is that goals have been reevaluated and new priorities are being assessed for the vehicle which will propel the new movement and no matter what those goals may turn out to be it is clear that grass roots participation in the black community will be crucial to the success of the new movement and it is on the level of grass roots participation that the new movement could be vulnerable social theorists and intellectuals invaluable and indispensable though they are are not noted for their willingness to dig deep into the practical mechanics of social revolution such is necessarily not the nature of their calling again the new movement can be compared to a technical organization once the engineer has specified or created the quantitative framework within which the problem is to be solved he turns it over to his technical assistantsthe technicians it is the technician who adapts the engineers framework so that it be   comes a viable means of accomplishing the task and the same type of division of responsibilities job specialization if you will must be evident in the new movement the technician in the movement is as yet a rare breed partly because far too many blacks have not done enough serious thinking to realize that they too have a definite place in the new engine of change our task then if we wish the new engine to have the necessary internal propulsion is to define the role of the technician and identify those who are qualified to fill that role the technician within the framework of the new movement deals with the task of increasing of the power base of the black community on its most basic most mundane level whether he is involved in a school betterment project or in a training project for existing and potential black businessmen his role remains that of working with the people where the people live at times he may be required to be a provocateur prodding the community into action on issues which have been the focus of much lively discussion but little direct action and this may well be the most frustrating task of the technician because of the apathy that still afflicts the black community overcoming the apathy of the black masses will not be an easy task but it is a vital step in the  liberation process the psychological shackles that bind our peoples minds must be loosened before we can hope to remove the more blatant shackles of economic and political deprivation once the walls of apathy are destroyed the technicians role gravitates from provocation to organization it is axiomatic that a social movement will falter and crumble unless there is a viable nexus of grass roots organizations that channel the objectives of an aroused community although the black community is beginning to respond to this historically oppressive system with a new resolve to control its own environment and make those whose actions affect the community responsible to it i have grave misgivings about the direction of the response like an escaped tiger the black community may lash out with such devastating fury that it may well engender white retaliations of such brutal massiveness that hitlers systematic genocide of the jews will seem like a german lovein by comparison and this very point deserves a further comment despite all the assertions about the efficacy of riots look at all the money they poured into watts after the revolution we delude ourselves and do our posterity a grave disservice by recommending or embracing riots as a longrun solution to our oppressive conditions there is a distinct logical inconsistency in the notion that riots which we quite rightly assert are brought on by the brutality and callousness of white society are the appropriate means of bringing that society to its senses for given the callousness and viciousness of white society the inevitable result of successive riots will not be to shock whites into reasonableness rather it will be to cause them to move swiftly to equip their police forces with more efficient weaponry and those of us who watched closely the white reaction to the recent revolutions and to the april outbreaks realize that even now police forces in nearly every major city are being supplied with such weaponry as armored vehicles special gases and electric nets to speak of riotous intimidation to a society which is wellversed in the arts of hideous oppression is to provide that society with an excuse to do what  years of slavery and  years of de facto slavery could not doannihilate black americans this is a harsh fact but one that must be borne in mind when we consider the particular engine that is to go into the new movement when seen in proper perspective riots are only a shortrun means of exposing the seriousness of the american race dilemma at the point that awareness is aroused in the white community and active concern developed in the black community riots as a tool of social change must be relegated to the tool shed already in the shed are many tools of the old movement including the genus of sitins lieins demonstrations and polite begging failure or reluctance of the engineers and technicians of the new movement to relinquish ineffective weapons will result in psychological disaster in the black community when the people realize that the movement isnt moving witness the fate of those who chauffeured the vehicle of the old movement  and consider the disillusionment that permeated the community when it became evident that the putative civil_rights movement was not only riding in the wrong vehicle of change but also was headed in the wrong direction and there was undoubtedly a causal relationship between the two erroneous strategies what then is a possible new tool for the movement an assessment of recent eventsie the sporadic revolutions and the subsequent reactions of the white communityindicates that tactical militancy and veiledthreat diplomacy are potentially potent weapons for the immediate future the riots have shaken the entire fabric of the society the white power structure has finally roused itself to the fact that recurring seasonal disturbances are a distinct possibility furthermore whites realize that short of complete extermination of blacks the riots can never be totally prevented given the power structures desire for law and orderwhich is functional tor a prosperous economic systemwe can expect whites to use a combination of coercion and concessions in attempts to obviate riots thus the new engineers and technicians must be adamant in demanding meaningful concessions and competent in meeting subtle coercion with equally subtle reminders that city hall can be ravaged just as easily as the corner grocery store this is the dangerous game of brinkmanship and there are those who will denounce it as radical but is the problem itself any less radical malcolm_x was quite correct when he stated that the history of this nation is but a study of the efficacy of raw power mercilessly and relentlessly applied nothingsave perhaps the dollar and law and orderis as highly respected in america as raw power if we must wave the bloody shirt to minimize the possibilities of more shirts being bloodied and if this strategy proves effective then the ethnics and morality of doing so become highly irrelevant the day of fighting white power as manifested in police brutality ghetto retroeducation job discrimination etc with love power is behind us the essence of leadership is the ability to use whatever power the constituents have as  a fulcrum in winning greater power the black communitys greatest power at the moment is not the fact of a riot but the omnipresent threat of a riot for the reality of a riot can be swiftly crushed but to crush the threat of a riot entails removal of the oppressive conditions which cause them this distinction must be borne in mind our definition of the role of technicians requires that these persons command those skills which are in short supply in the black community it is only too evident that these technical skills are in greatest abundance in the great middleclass specifically the negro middle class nmc a careful analysis of what the new black has wrought the ghetto in terms of white assistance reveals that success in recruiting nmc technicians may be crucial to the viability of the entire new movement when whites found their grip on the old engine slipping they couldnt get out of the ghetto soon enough to be sure some whites have been drawn into the ghetto as a result of the revolutions but the exodus has exceeded the influx and this causes us no real regret because the black community can do without the type of white assistance which arrives with too many strings attached eclectism in receiving white assistance is in keeping with the new mood of the black community the very nature of the new spirit demands that whites who would serve the black community in various capacities be in the words of roxburys brian rollins properly sensitized the black community must be certain that white teachers as an example who would instruct our youngsters know enough black history to counterbalance george washington with the great kings of ancient african empires abraham lincoln with nat turner and marcus garvey eli whitney with charles drew and george washington carver and so on and since teachers impart culture as well teach subjects perhaps the black community should demand that they be properly tuned into afroamerican culture before they are allowed to go prancing down to the neighborhood school we must be certain that we do not attract a new flood of slum tourists and dilettantes who upon discovering that blacks no longer worship at the altar of white society haul themselves off to haightashbury for pot pleasures or back home to rejoin physically the society they never left psychologically the necessity of sensitizing white technicians is an integral part of the surge to place complete control over the destiny of blacks in the hands of blacks while whites muse and debate over the advisability of surrendering themselves to a sensitizing process as a condition for being technicians in the new movement the construction of the new engine must go on hence we return to the previously mentioned negro middle class nmcthe black bourgeoisie as e franklin frazier dubbed them how can we tap the reservoir of technical skills that lie dormant in the nmc can the traditionally aloof and indifferent nmc be drawn into the new engine an unmistakable result of the sporadic revolutions was the terror that gripped the nmc communities the insecurities and vulnerabilities that accompany the social statuses of the nmc were heightened by the fiery demonstrations of the lumpenproletariat the black bourgeoisie has been knocking on the door of white society for decades yet the revolutions found them still pounding frantically for admission the fact that the walls which surround the nmc psyche were shaken is a testimony to the efficacy of the black_power mood indications are that the nmc is no longer sure that its goal of complete assimilation into the white society is realistic or even desirable no less a personality than the president of the national congress of negro women has admonished her convention to cut back on the teas and fashion shows and to get involved in a meaningful way in the problems of the ghetto and even ralph bunche phd has become more willing to identify with the chronic problems of the black community it would appear then that the new mood of black militancythat sanctus spirituo of the new movementis a very powerful mover indeed if we have read the nmc signs of insecurity correctly then we can appeal to them on at least two levels the most basic level is that of enlightened selfinterest the nmc can be shown that their vulnerability is of a dual nature they know only too well that had baldwin hills been located near watts it is probable that the nmc would have suffered both the ravaging strokes of the revolutionists and the savage retaliation of the police forces and the possibility that future riots may spread beyond the ghetto causes the nmc even more discomfort hence this dual vulnerability becomes a wedge by which we can pry them loose from the steppes of pseudowhite society and make them effective components in the new engine of change on another level they can be recruited on the basis of appeals to their desires to be a part of something significant there is undeniable status attached to meaningful activity of any sort and the nmc members seek that status as vigorously as does white society they can be shown that accomplishments in the new movement of black progress can be as personally rewarding as achievements in other  spheres of nmc life couple this appeal with the previously given choice of acting or being savagely reacted to and we eventually compel them to drive their long cars right down funky funky broadway where they will emerge trembling and illatease unaware that they have indeed finally arrived as implied in everything that we have said about the nmc and their role in the new engine of change the black community will not accept the nmc as spokesmen for the movement if the cause of dignity of full participation for the black masses is to be promoted with the candor and vigor that is necessary the nmc is hardly qualified to tell it like it is their role must remain that of providing technical assistance to the largely underdeveloped and overexploited black community spokesmen for the new movement will emerge from the black ghetto itself so white society and the nmc should ready themselves to accept these indigenous spokesmen there is no choice the remaining largely untapped source of technical assistance are the expanding numbers of black collegians whounlike the present nmchave been reared under two ideological phases of the movement for black equality they have witnessed the little rocks the impressive march on washington and the selmas and they have seen the old guard of integrationists fall victim to the very goals for which they were strivingassimilation having experienced a far more intimate and sustained encounter with the working of white society than had the older generation these students find the charms of the majority group wholly superficial hypocritical and generally irrelevant black students increasingly reject the notion that everything and anything of value necessarily lies in white society more willing to be critical than their parents black students have proclaimed defunct the integrationassimilation apparatus constructed by earlier engineers of the movement they seek salvation outside the loss of identity of that integration must entail the emergence of allblack organizations on predominantly white campuses and the new surge of black militancy on predominantly black campuses see robert a malsons article on the black_power rebellion at howard university in december negro digest are manifestations of the restive nononsense mood of black collegians finding a heretofore unrecognized common bond of strength that makes for a new esprit de corps black students appear anxious to involve themselves in community projects while some black student groups have found their own projects to work others have been content to let the sanctus spirituo of the new movement drift around the halls of academe like a drunken apparitionelated but anomalous the massiveness of the task and the paucity of black resources necessitate a more economical and efficient use of these black student organizations the skills which they are learningwhether those skills be in business law sociology engineering or whatevercan be readily utilized in the black community if existing programs do not provide the framework within which black student skills can be effectively utilized then it is the duty of the new movement engineers to construct frameworks in new programs equipped with a drive shaft of black engineers the new engine of change is set to propel the new movement in directions which the black community must move ie toward economic and political power the drive will not be an easy one and casualties will occur but for the vision of a better tomorrow the new movement will move ondriven by an indomitable engine of black unity
during the last years y n  of the life of w e b du bois i had the good fortune to live just a few garden hedges away from the great man and his wife shirley graham every afternoon he insisted on taking a ride through ghanas countryside and occasionally i went with him i never got over my awe of him and i was usually tonguetied in his presence feeling i was sitting not with a mere man but with history sometimes though i summoned enough courage to ask him if he had known this or that black intellectual or political figure from the late th century when he had begun his lifes work usually dr du bois had known the person mentioned and more often than not he would say a very fine man he did very good work but and here he would shake his head sadly he never wrote enough the good doctor believed that a tragic shortcoming of black men of affairs had so often been their failure to leave behind them the written record of what they had done a legacy he knew to be so much more valuable than wealth and property because upon it future generations could plan and build with a knowledge of what their fathers had done today most of us are keenly aware of these shortcomings and the appearance of a new book by a black author is almost always an event to be hailed especially is this true when the book is a work of criticism an area in which we have not yet achieved distinction if its author is a man of mature years whom we know has been a close observer of the scene he describes we open the book with great expectations the crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruses first book begins with such promise it is a thick book nearly  pages expensive  liberally sprinkled with footnotes and supported by both an index a list of supplementary biographical sources and a postscript on black_power its subject matter plus its impressive production guarantees that it will be a brisk seller especially on college campuses where interest in what black intellectuals are thinking is high but books about them very scarce for these reasons one regrets the painful necessity of having to report that the crisis of the negro intellectual despite its promise and all its builtin advantages is a glaring failure and worse a ship that has sailed into port under false colors it has come not to lead us into serious inquiry about the basic problems facing black intellectuals and black people in general but to destroy the victims of this destructive thrust are not the valid ones of wrong obsolete and untenable ideas and attitudes but a long list of artists and intellectuals many of them dead whom mr cruse happens not to like we have the authors own word for it almost alone of black intellectuals he has kept the flames of black nationalism burning while the rest have been dancing the boogaloo to alien ideologies cruses main thesistrue enough as far as it goes but not at all originalis that there have usually been two political tendencies which have existed in black communities the drive towards full integration and equality in the majority white community as opposed to the separatist black nationalist movements according to cruse the nationalist movements have been continually frustrated by an evil coalition conspiratorial in nature between the whites of the communist party and a succession of notsobright black writers acting as willing or duped agents of the communists among these agents he manages to include nearly every black writer who has published a book or had a play produced since mr cruse himself began his long apprenticeship as an author it may seem unkind to suggest that the author has labored over this long work primarily to settle old scores with more successful colleagues but even a casual glance at his table of contents and index makes this conclusion inescapable for example the life of du bois spanned nearly  years he wrote so much that no library in the world has succeeded in compiling a complete bibliography of his works he was unquestionably the greatest intellectual ever produced by black america and outside his own country he is generally recognized as one of the great western thinkers a product of the age before specialization his work ranged over a large number of disciplines and arts from philosophy psychology sociology and history at the one end to journalism novels and poetry at the other he was not only the father but the grandfather of us all and his impact on the black american whether intellectual or not was so profound that we all bear his stamp it goes without saying that any author purporting to seriously analyze the crisis of black intellectuals throughout american history must devote major attention to such a giant how then can one explain that there is an entire chapter devoted to the crucifixion of the late lorraine hansberry author of two plays a raisin in the sun and the sign in sidney brusteins window while there is no chapter on du bois of course mr cruse must refer to the old man but there are only  references to du bois while there are  to a young woman whose artistic life tragically spanned less than five years although lorraine was not noted for maidenly modesty she would have been the first to protest that cruse was giving her too much attention and she would have been too kind to draw the conclusion that what really bothered her critic was not her ideological peculiarities but the tremen dous commercial success achieved by her play a raisin in the sun to be fair mr cruse may have some justification for the dislike of miss hansberry at the height of her success mr cruse asked her to read a musical play he had written presumably with the idea that she as a new celebrity and rolling in bread might help him get it on the boards lorraine with characteristic candor declined the honor of reading it saying she didnt know anything about musicals as a fellow writer i can imagine how annoyed cruse must have been for just now i have a play knocking around which i know is the greatest thing written since will shakespeare checked out but even some of my socalled best friends persist in being jackasses by stubbornly disagreeing with me and i am considering devoting a chapter to each one of them in my next book many of the new militants are excited about the cruse book and impatient with greybeards like this reviewer who refuses to confine himself to the issues raised within the book naturally the new militants want to get on with it and like most of todays students are not much interested in anything that happened before they got out of high school but to concentrate only on the issues would be as simpleminded as to confine a discussion of the johnson war in vietnam to mr johnsons latest state of the union message in the book as in the message there are so many distortions spiteful inferences and downright lies that serious intellectual exchange becomes impossible because we are forced to speculate on the basic honesty and integrity of the author there are plenty of eyewitnesses to the murderous fiasco being acted out in asia but the ranks of those who were present at some of the events mr cruse describes are thinning and it is imperative that while a few of us are still about we set the record straight for example it is impossible to understand many of the postworld war ii events in harlem the clash of ideology between black and white marxists on the one hand and the black nationalists on the other unless one understands the vital role cruse himself played in these events yet the author after describing nearly everybody else as a ccc cardcarrying communist especially personalities who might be harmed by the charge shows a strange reluctance to appear on stage himself to anyone who doesnt know writers such reticence may at first seem admirable but the rest of us detect a peculiar and not very pleasant smell so lets take a closer look at the chapter origins of the dialogue cruse describes how in august  the harlem writers club a dissident group which had split with the more orthodox marxistoriented committee for the negro in the arts demanded that the harlem political left wing establish a harlem cultural commission to oversee the complicated and aggravated situation in the community    the rejected strain of nationality consciousness was in conflict with the integrationist trend over community cultural policies backed to the hilt by the party line this heated battle was carried into the communist partys harlem headquarters by the chairman of the club myself that is to say cruse and the cochairman unless the reader actually knows he may get the idea that this is a confrontation between black nationalists and communists with cruse a lonely churchillian figure arguing for black autonomy from the backbenches but it isnt that at all this is an intracommunist party struggle which could only have occurred between communists for why on earth would a dedicated group of black nationalists seek the permission of the interracial communist party to operate in harlem where presumably they the black nationalists would have deeper roots and greater strength this is where the question of honesty comes in at no point does mr cruse tell his readers what they have a right to know what indeed all of us who were there already know certainly it is no secret from the interested intelligence agencies of the federal government from whom presumably mr cruse is not now seeking employment this knowledge is that in  he was an upandcoming marxist theoretician not a black nationalist and not a mere rankandfiler like the rest of us i can remember how we youngsters looked up to him because he functioned on a policymaking level speaking from a background of such authority cruse could no doubt tell us more than he has in his book and the average reader would understand how he came to know so much as we have already decided i hope not prematurely that cruse is not bucking for a job in washington my only conclusion is that he wants to be sure he is in step with the younger militants by establishing a background that he has always been antiwhite and antiintegrationist if i am right this is a great pity for there is no reason for any black intellectual of mr cruses age to be ashamed of the fact that he once believed in the possibility of american social and political regeneration which could be achieved by something less than total revolution men are not born revolutionaries nearly always they become that long after they have considered attempted and finally abandoned every other option i think it is a healthy development that militant black youths set the pace today but it ought to be generally recognized that the world they are determined to change was not created in  and that they and their conclusions are the end products of several generations of struggle and development thus it seems to this reviewer that mr cruse ought to be proud of the fact that in the late forties he was among the first of the young blacks to challenge white power in the american communist party the fact that he did not at the time coin the slogan black_power is no mark against him catchy phrases seem to drop from heaven franklin roosevelts ringing declaration that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself is said to have been lifted bodily from a macys department store advertisement  mr cruse and some of his friends were among the first to recognize that the party slogan negro and white unity was inconsistent with the realities of the black community by this i mean that the ideal of the u s communist party of uniting under one banner black and white urban and rural workers was simply beyond realization because it did not take into account the profound and qualitative importance of race in the american situation that the most miserable white considered himself the superior of the most accomplished black that in a time of crisis the whites would be bound to throw in their lot with the white power structure and that blacks had to be organized as blacks under black direction these conclusions which seem so obvious now were a long time in the making spanning several generations and my only point here is that if one happens to have been unfortunate enough to have been a gleam in his daddys eye in the twenties instead of the forties he has nothing to be ashamed of especially if he played an honorable part in the development of black political thought here is the rub here again is where the knowledge of what actually happened on a personality level prevents this reviewer from considering only the issues raised in the book and forces him to question the motives of the author at the time to which we are referring mr cruse had written a play im sure it was a very fine play but the left wing offbroadway theater groups which were the only ones encouraging black writers then had all turned it down naturally the aspiring playwright was very bitter understandably so and a reviewer in  cant help but wonder whether or not the authors current and bitter antimarxism is not more personal than ideological otherwise how are we to explain these contradictions that in  when he was leading an anticommunist black nationalist struggle he was at the same time asking the white communistcontrolled theatre groups to produce his play that more than a decade after lorraine hansberry as cruse implies revealed herself to be hopelessly integrationist and a puppet of the white marxists he was asking her to lend her name prestige and money in support of his musical play these questions far from being petty probably reveal the wellsprings of the book a phenomenon of our age is that men trapped in the rush of events are frequently forced to hide or denounce the noblest acts of their lives thus people who understood the growing threat of world fascism in the nineteenthirties are hesitant about acknowledging that they once supported the republican cause in spain and some of the men who took up guns and  went away to risk their lives in the faraway hills near barcelona and madrid are ashamed to admit it today because the prevailing american attitude is that it was all a communist plot yet those were to use the maudlin phrase the best years of their lives it is a curious twist of history that middleaged black men should also hide their past ideological commitments for they have nothing to gain by it except the contempt of their colleagues and of their white enemies who could not care less what these blacks did  or  years ago in the crisis of the negro intellectual the author frequently calls attention to apparent contradictions in positions taken by w e b du bois inexplicably writes cruse on page  he dubois joined in  the decimated ranks of the american communist partya violent aboutface for a man who had spent the s and the s rejecting communism and again on page  the reason that the debate on black economy has gone back and forth for years with no conclusions reached is because the idea is closely linked with nationalism and the integrationists would rather be tarred and feathered than suspected of the nationalist taint this was the great weakness of w e b du boisthe only real flaw in the mans intellectual equipment du bois upheld the idea of a separate black economy as not so easily dismissed because in the first place we have already got a partially separate economy in the united states yet he remarked in  that his economic program for negro advance can easily be mistaken for a program of complete racial segregation and even nationalism among negroes    this is a misapprehension  if one can so completely miss the point about the greatest black intellectual whose thoughts are mostly gathered in libraries available to cruse there is small wonder that he is constantly off the beam about lesser mortals a man who lived from  to  and whose entire productive life was concerned with the advancement of his people might very well be  expected to have changed his mind frequently far be it for me to remind mr cruse of the philosophers admonition that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds the du bois odyssy spreads over the entire history of the united states since the first civil war which ended in  he was neither an integration nor a black nationalist he was too great a genius to be encompassed under petty labels all of his prodigious energies were devoted to bringing the human race especially the ethnic section of it to which he belonged from darkness into light he was never a man of fashion and it would not have bothered him for one moment that a position he had taken on monday turned out to be wrong on tuesday he would simply have changed his position for he was in the best sense of the word a social scientist who drew his conclusions from all of the available hard evidence fully cognizant as the genuine scientists are that todays conclusions may be proved false by tomorrows discoveries du bois never claimed to have found a solution to the economic problems of the black man in the united states economics was not one of his disciplines and even if it had been in all probability he would have failed to anticipate as did all the master thinkers of his time the nations incredible technological achievement that would dislocate the traditional relation ship between labor and production and make the black worker and not a small number of white workers not only unwanted but obsolete this development alone not to mention the concurrent and related worldwide expansion of the american empire creates profound and complex problems for those attempting to chart the future of the black man in the united states happily mr cruse is keenly aware of the implications of these developments and reveals himself at his intellectual best in the chapter capitalism revisited where he offers a devastating analysis of the economic philosophy of the black bourgeoisie as represented by businessman hope stevens and the ultraconservative journalist george s schuyler who has never forgiven roosevelt for the new deal quite rightly mr cruse calls to our attention the best if limited contribution that du bois made in the area of economics in his  autobiography dust of dawn where in the words of cruse du bois outlined a whole new concept of what he called the cooperative commonwealth for the american negro yet this very important aspect of du boiss thinking is never even mentioned today by the various black intellectual worshippers of the du bois tradition cruses main contribution in this chapter is to call attention to the poverty of serious analysis of the black mans economic situation by writers and politicians  of either the left or the right as the reader may have gathered my reaction to the crisis of the negro intellectual has been mostly negative and i welcome the opportunity to applaud a section of the book in this chapter serious inquiry replaces the settling of old grudges and mr cruses prowess in the area of economics suggests that he may have a good deal more to offer certainly we need all the help we can get elsewhere in the book mr cruse makes another positive contribution when he calls attention to our unhealthy tendency to worship and praise our heroes and spokesmen uncritically the best of our leaders and the cause of liberation would have been better served had all of them been subjected to searching analysis of the quality mr cruse calls for in his book like most men who have lived full lives du bois probably did a lot of things he would not want to take any credit for today after dinner with him one evening in accra i was in the process of making some rather angry remarks about roy wilkins who i believe is still the executive secretary of the naacp i have forgotten what idiotic act prompted my emotional outburst but i recall very vividly that the old man held up his hand and asked me to keep quiet i wanted to know what right w e b du bois had to curtail julian mayfields freedom of speech he explained that it made him feel guilty to hear me attack roy wilkins for in the s he du bois had been responsible for bringing mr wilkins a middle western journalist to the attention of the naacp hierarchy in new york i was astounded for all i knew about his relations with roy wilkins was that the younger man had dropped du bois when the whites in washington had decided finally and forever that they didnt like him i apologized for speaking angrily against mr wilkins and sought to console the good doctor after all  said if it should turn out that dr du bois and i were both wrong and that there was indeed a heaven somewhere st peter would probably forgive w e b du bois for the wilkins error even the greatest of men make mistakes the point of this story is that there is nothing in the life which has been honestly lived that should be ignored if history happens to take any account of you i dont of course mean petty things but those aspects of your life that touch on your work if a man like du bois could confess that he was responsible for bringing roy wilkins to new york then certainly people like cruse and myself ought to have the guts to admit to murder or rape backing the cause of racial integration and the correction of social injustice whether the victim is white or black may be unfashionable and uncle tomish now but there was a time not so  long ago when it was downright dangerous as i approach the age of forty i dont want to blot out many of my most cherished experiences merely to seem current or camp i dont regret that i was at least a face in the protesting crowds a signature on petitions and finally a mourner at the funeral during the crucible of julius and ethel rosenberg not for a moment do i feel regret that with hundreds of others i trudged around the white house with my miserable signs protesting the death sentences passed on the martinsville seven black boys condemned for the rape of a white woman in virginia willie mcgee executed for raping a white woman or the trenton six whose alleged crime i dont remember mindless and emotional some of this may seem to those who stood aloof but i like to think that we would still pile into cars and speed headlong up to the peekskill riots to challenge incipient american fascism which was trying to prevent paul robeson from giving a concert not for anything would i trade the ugly and bizarre memory of watching peekskills negro elks standing between the local ku klux klan and the american legion all of them shouting at us to go back to russia where we came from it was good to be alive then and committed to the ideal of destroying political and social injustice just as it is now mr cruse would have us believe that the reds and the integrationists conspired in the destruction of the american negro theater ant and that the principal instruments of this destruction were the actors who deserted for the greenerlooking fields downtown such an assertion is transparently ridiculous i recall those days very well and no black actor in the country was so busy that he could not have accepted engagements uptown and across town and still have had time to spare there just werent that many roles available as there arent now except for a few individuals moreover anyone who has been on the periphery of the theatre as long as mr cruse has ought to know that there is never a shortage of actors playwrights and producers yes actors never but let us assume for the sake of argument that mr cruse is correct that the departure of certain actors had a disastrous effect on cn awhat was to prevent those who remained from carrying on or even organizing a new theatre you certainly didnt need communist party permission or money to operate in harlem in those days all you needed was faith in a play the will to try and plenty of elbow grease maxie glanville ossie davis and i embarked on disastrous theatrical ventures more than once the intrepid gertrude jeanette was practically a onewoman company writer producing and directing her own plays writer loften mitchell was the busiest legit theaterperson in harlem neither asking nor needing the permission of anyone to write produce direct and fail as we all did actressplaywright alice childress had a number of plays produced in little theaters one of them florence is i believe a permanent addition to our literature as actors and writers we worked on broadway and off way downtown and way uptown wherever we could find work and get training in our crafts we lost every penny we could beg or borrow but at least a few plays got done some of them not without artistic merit it is now nearly  years since the collapse of the american negro theatre surely within this time mr cruse and his associates could have come up with a play hired a hall called the actors together and put it on however if this thought has occurred to them there is no evidence of it but except for his chapter capitalism revisited mr cruse is not concerned with constructive effort he is clearly out to settle scores with those who it seems to him have made it up the ladder apparently at his expense thus of this impressive number of hopefuls in ant only a small handful are around today to boast of some success in the theatreruby dee ossie davis sidney poitier alice childress maxwell glanville harry belafonte and frederick oneal interestingly enough with the exception of oneal all these survivors found their pathway to later prominence in the integrated theatre through the harlem political left wings   cruse even professes to see something sinister in the fact that some of these people later worked together the left wing cultural forces had moved into postwar prominence sidney poitier was soon to be seen on the stages of a theatre operated by cna the committee for the negro in the arts he was also featured offbroadway in longitude  written by a white left wing playwright some ten years later poitier along with ruby dee and later ossie davis were stars of lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun it is hardly coincidence that to this day the names of poitier davis dec and others repeatedly turn up in juxtaposition what are we to make of such a statement is it paranoia or simple ignorance of show business realities that the names of davis and dee repeatedly turn up in juxtaposition should surprise no one they follow the same profession and have been married to one another for nearly  years and surely harold cruse knows that no black actor not even academy awardwinning poitier and only a handful of white superstars are in a position to make basic decisions in  the motion picture or television industries that the very nature of commercial show business in our system requires that the producer think first of the biggest names he can get if he is to be able to raise the money to make his picture or get his show on the boards and that the fact that there are so few black actors of any prominence makes it inevitable that they will appear together over and over again if it is all a left wing conspiracy as the author suggests we must be prepared to believe that the great banks of wall street are involved in it for it is they who ultimately determine what pictures are made for the mass media like mr cruse i envy those who have made a bundle of money and won fame in the business to which i once aspired but as a student of the american system he should understand that they are no more to blame for their success than they are for his failure such a system will never permit the emergence of more than a limited number of firstclass black talents and that is  why over the generations we have lost so many brilliant artists who simply had to give up because there was no place for them the crisis of the negro intellectual is a long book and an adequate review of it would have to be about as long for on almost every page and in almost every footnote there are distortions malevolent misinterpretations andit must be saidoutright lies in the rest of my space i can call attention to only a few of these concentrating on matters about which i have personal knowledge unfortunately i wasnt born when claude mckay was working on his poem if we must die and it never occurred to me until  read this book to wonder if the poem had been written under the influence of the communist party but apparently this is a question of inexhaustible fascination for mr cruse and on page after dreary page he offers extensive documentation on the communist connections of every major and minor black figure in literature the number of people on mr cruses crap list is inexhaustible and includes an entire ethnic group west indians whom the author holds largely responsible for the downfall of marcus garvey himself a son of the islands the inestimable enrichment of afroamerican culture and intellectuality by west indians amounts to nothing in mr cruses eyes because some of them had the good sense to read and be influenced by the ideas of karl marx shooting from the hip the author draws his pistols and fires two chapters one at west indians in general and the other at richard b moore now an elderly bookshop keeper in harlem who was a socialist as far back as  and according to cruse a founder of the american communist party to make matters worse he is also a west indian this reviewer with the historian john henrik clarke novelist john o killens and political leader robert f williams come in for special attention from mr cruse the author reminds me that in  i interviewed miss ruby dee for the newspaper freedom and that i neglected to ask her why she left the american negro theatre in  that happens to be the year i was graduated from high school and fully two years before i ever heard of miss dee or ant his inference is that her departure was part of the red integrationist plot to destroy ant that is of course a possibility but isnt it more likely that she left broadway for the same reason that mr cruse took his book downtown to a white publisher there are hardly any black publishers just as until recently there was not a single black producing company that could offer anything but occasional work to black actors one should also remember that in  miss dee was hardly a star and wonderful actress though she is there was no reason why a healthy theatre company should have collapsed just because she left on page  mr cruse claims he visited the offices of freedom and left with a feeling of desolation and angry disgust at the cliquish remoteness from changing reality that pervaded this newspaper one could plainly see that its writers were intellectual prisoners of the dying left wing movement dutifully and blindly obeying the mandate to hang on but at the same time they were preparing for their own grand exit into the integrated cultural world and what in fact could one expect the sentiments of killens hansberry dee mayfield clarke and company to bewhen the great intellectual scholar dr w e b du bois had given his official sanction to freedom newspaper in  miss hansberry was just over  years old and very junior at freedom none of the rest of the company he mentions was ever on the staff of freedom though the writers among us might have contributed an occasional article but here the wary reader will ask himself what was harold cruse doing at the office of freedom in the first place this is  three years after the ant betrayal the newspaper is marxistoriented and on the staff are a number of people who mr cruse knows to be hopelessly committed to the cause of integration why is he there among the enemy the answer is partly obvious like the rest of us struggling writers he has taken his manuscript to wherever there was a chance of getting it printed and the editors of freedom have been shortsighted enough to reject yet another cruse creation no wonder he left with a feeling of desolation  and angry disgust  every rejection slip affects me the same way to harold cruse the selfdefense movement of robert f williams in monroe north carolina was a monumental fiasco unquestionably he is right if he means that we did not win our ultimate objective which was to gain more power for the blacks of union county and that some were forced to flee the country if victory could be vouchsafed to militants our ranks would no doubt be overflowing on the other hand if young black militants have any idea that mr cruse as critic represents the wave of the future that he is a sort of latterday frantz fanon they had better read page  where he reveals that he is now just as terrified of whiteys power as he has been over the last two decades no vision of the proletarian revolution whether in mayfields black tones or in white leftist tones can seriously project overthrowing the federal structure it is so powerfully big that even the conservative right wing is worried to the point of extreme apoplexy    the cumulative effect of the charges mr cruse levels against the present reviewer is that i have not yet succeeded in formulating a comprehensive ideology of struggle for black americans of course he is absolutely correct i dont want to quibble but neither has he formulated such an ideology and as a writer he has had many more years in which to accomplish this than i have i have left the cuban experience until last because the incident is to me the key to what makes harold cruse run it is july  and a group of american writers are guests of the revolutionary government in the sierra maestra among the writers are john henrik clarke cruse leroi jones and myself for weeks fidel and his comrades have exhorted the cuban people to make a pilgrimage to these mountains from which he launched his revolution the target number to make the pilgrimage is  but the new government does not expect that many people and has made no plans to get them off the mountains however there is an euphoria over cuba and the people take fidel at his words weeks before the july th celebration they begin to make their way up the roads to the mountains nearly a million people a sixth of the entire population are there posing a monumental problem for the young leaders who have underestimated their own popularity when the celebration is over the narrow roads are jammed and the single railroad taxed far beyond its capacity because everyone is trying to leave at the same time there is hardly any food or water and to make matters worse the carbine of a young militiaman has been accidentally discharged and shot up the main water pump so everybody is hot dirty hungry and thirsty despite the use of helicopters and trucks screaming up and down the roads it remains an almost impossible task to meet the gastronomic and sanitation needs of so many people guests of the government are taken care of first but still there is considerable inconvenience and discomfort because there is nothing to do about it john henrik clarke and i go off to search for a place to sleep having found an abandoned oldsmobile of about  vintage and made our beds we return to the mess hall to find a riot in the making of all the delegations from a score of nations only one of them is creating a disturbance and it is to our shame the north americans the chief spokesman of the delegation is harold cruse and his two subalterns are very pale young white women all of whom are screaming at the harassed cuban aide assigned to us that they are starving to death and dying of thirst the profuse apologies of the poor aide whose command of english is practically nil are of no avail the fact that half a million people in these mountains are experiencing the same discomfiture has no impression on cruse and then i hear him the black nationalist cruse backed up by the two white women scream at the cuban youd damn well better get us something to eat and drink or ill go back to the states and write the worst things i can think of about you and your damned revolution i wrote down these words of cruse before i went to sleep that night and before reporting them here i have checked them against the recollection of others who were there the man who screamed that blackmail threat merely for food and water is the author of the crisis of the negro intellectual the political pundit who presumes to sit in moral judgment on almost every black person who has written and published a book a play or a poem i often disagreed with my friend lorraine hansberry and i still have differences with the american communist party which may one day be reconciled but there is one thing for which i shall never forgive either of them and that is that on the two occasions i have mentioned they did not help to produce harold cruses plays if they had he too might have become rich and famous that is he might have got his ration of food and water and we might have been spared this spiteful book
james  weldon johnson who was poet diplomat and j y civil_rights leader was also mentor to many young writers of the literary renaissance of harlem one of his friends was claude mckay a young jamaican poet of promise whom johnson met in  mckay like some other artists of that era went into exile abroad it was while mckay was working with max eastman as an associate editor and drama critic for the liberator that he had the unpardonable experience that no doubt climaxed his growing disenchantment with america he and an artist friend attended a new york play opening as part of the invited guests and the press corps the usher who was supported by the manager refused to seat mckay in the press box although not a member of the communist party but certainly interested in communism and the recent russian revolution of  mckay decided to go to russia it was james weldon johnson who helped him make financial arrangements for the trip that took him to various parts of europe and eventually to morocco johnson gave a gala farewell party at his harlem residence for mckay and guests included many of the black literary personages of that era  mckay describes his colorful experiences abroad in his autobiography a long way from home in a chapter entitled hail and farewell to morocco he brings the reader up to that phase of his life when he decides to return to the united states it is interesting to note that mckay gives very little information about his decision to reum especially since his citizenship was periled there is evidence that it was johnson who played a major role in persuading mckay to return to harlem johnson wrote in a letter to max eastman that mckay    does seem to be anxious to come back to the united states we know that johnson even went to washington d c to speak to officials at the department of state concerning mckays return in the same letter to eastman johnson stated that he had    secured a copy of home to harlem and sent it to the assistant secretary of state with whom i had the conference regarding claude i sent it backing up my statements to him regarding claudes literary status  the following three documents are interesting sidelights in that they answer some questions about claude mckay the proletarian poetnovelist and james weldon johnson the creative and genteel black american both men lived in an era of great social upheavals that are now significant historical events january   my dear mr mckay i have just written a little biographical sketch of you for harper and brothers for bringing out your book they are going to send me a copy as soon as the book is off the press i am very anxious to see it and i hope it is going to have quite a sale i have been wanting to write you for some time i should like very much if you were back in the states in fact right in new york you ought to be here to take full advantage of the great wave of opportunity that negro literary and other artists are enjoying in additionwe need you to give more strength and solidity to the whole movement i wish you would think about coming back and if i can in any way be of any assistance whatever please do not hesitate to call on me with kindest regards i am 
his nigger was never supposed to learn how to write but he did and eldridge cleaver in the infancy of his new groove is already performing dearly needed surgery on this sickest of nations with his higher uneducation brother eldridge in soul on ice mcgrawhill  cuts through all the nooks and crannies where hide the desperate secrets of the american madness to the essay cleaver brings scholarship passion and a freewheeling turnyouon style and not even the polemist hunters can deny the literary achievement in his works leroi jones reminded an audience of the way white gym teachers used to tell black youngsters to quit dribbling and shooting the basketball so fancy imploring them to do it natural but that was natural for you you know said jones likewise with cleavers prose we should know by now that eldridge cleaver was for some  years a prisoner having been busted for getting caught with a shopping bag full of    love in this land where youre only supposed to get high the way the crooks get high and for being a rapist cleaver just as certainly as he knows the one was not a crime knows that the other was and in his writing explores that experience including his motivations concluding that he had gone astray not so much from the white mans law as from being human civilized even the smallest insight into america reveals her extraordinary absence of depth blindness where there ought to be vision tradition where the need is imagination and the form of delusion that assumes longevity to be experience cleaver the fortunate victim of circumstances that forced him to get to himself in the process peeped the card of the populace this surgeon is not content to carelessly bandage the little cuts that irritate us into a more awesome fascism but instead takes his knife and cuts all the way to the ass where everybody says the pain is and brings to the surface even the secret secrets one has no choice but to witness his terrifying depth blowing away the puritan left in thee and rejoice for having discovered this youthful trailblazer who is as fresh as the next young girl who smiles your way and as wise as the school board decided we would never be they will accuse indeed they already have brother eldridge of being hungup on sexof course not once realizing that they have accused him of being hungup on lifewhich  is only the logical course for those who so skillfully created a god that disdains the act of love reading cleaver and the murder of jesus christ by wilhelm reich at the same time it is impossible to believe that the two did not communicate for they both the essayist and the psychiatrist the black man and the white man shared that liberating knowledge of the connection between mans and womans inability to function as whole sexual units and their helpless succumbing to the fatal mandate of the warlords cleaver could have as easily quoted reich as norman mailer in his assertion that the upper classes exchange sex for power in his brilliant essay the primeval mitosis cleaver scientifically examines that which underlies the white man s having rendered himself sexless and given to the black man all such powerswhich of course makes the destruction of that power ie black man essential to his own frank james jesse james l b james supremacy of the universe cleaver believes as poetsociologist calvin hernton opined at a new york conference a few years back that a good piece would go a long long way to more good pieces perhaps notes on a native son is without question one of the more important critical looks at james baldwin however much it might affront the sensibility of the baldwin lovers and it does at first struck by baldwins power at combining the alphabet with the volatile elements of his soul cleaver allows that he was among we brothers who lusted for everything that came out of baldwins mind but suddenly he finds himself appalled by what he calls baldwins shameful fanatical fawning sycophantic love of the whites he speaks with more sensitivity than did sylvester leaks a few years ago of baldwins hatred for blacks which was of course rather obvious in his earliest writingsalthough neither cleaver nor this reviewer recognized it as such at first because and sometimes cleaver seems to avoid this horrible truth our love for black people was still rather dubiousand gradually gets to what really outrages him baldwins quarrels with norman mailer and richard wright and baldwins homosexuality while one accepts that the homosexual is offcenter which is perhaps taking a gutless position one must tell an otherwise perceptive cleaver to go straight to hell with that crap that would equate baldwin with the white mans most valuable tool in oppressing other blacks believing that men do not simply become homosexuals any more than they simply become prisoners one is quick to wonder if perhaps the power in baldwin which cleaver honors is as much the product of his experiences as is eldridges own one grows tired of being reminded that baldwin hated black people because they failed to produce rembrandt because one thinks that that favorite cliche of his critics has lost validity except as an historical reference do we really believe that baldwin because of our image of him has not grown and are we convinced he has grown less than those of us who indulge in the kind of emptiness that rewards us with a womandespising manhood some of us hate ourselves because we cannot find a meaningful relationship with a woman and because we are addicted to heterosexuality are doomed to the familiar wandering and frustration we get plentyof what cleaver talks about baldwins contradictions and giving reason to believe that he understands the value of meaningful relationships between man and woman it seems rather a contradiction that he could dismiss baldwins essay on andre gide with out confessing that it was instructive for him in terms of his own manhood cleaver on baldwin is penetrating consuming and not without the ambiguity one comes upon in the best of art but it leaves you feeling that he saved his most vicious screams for the man he really loves as indeed he should which says something else about eldridge cleaver something beautiful and one can only hope to someday read baldwin on cleaver eldridge the ofay watcher is another gas ofay watchers anonymous we might be called because we exist concealed in the shadows wherever colored people have known oppression by whites    he writes before putting together a compact but full treatise on the crimes of the american white man and the lifestyle grown out of those crimes black nationalist cleaver ironically brings seldom observed insight into the dilemma of the young whites who would be caught up in the web of blueeyed lies that is their inheritance and in spite of his militant friends who dont yet understand that what made the beast a beast can make others beasts which has nothing to do really with reverse racism that jive term cleaver is courageous enough to not save for an easier time his understanding that all that black those young folk are getting next to will also blow blue eyes out of this patch in the pasture which reminds me that one afternoon in a tv studio i watched brother cleaver take notes and found it hard to believe he was the same cat whose writings had turned me not just on but loose there was something going on in his head that i naturally then could not see but we should all see and eldridge knows it and he would help us what more can you say about a brothers work

rannie toomers little baby boy snooks was dying from double pneumonia and whooping cough she sat away from him looking into the low fire her long crusty bottom lip hanging she was not married was not pretty was not anybody much and he was all she had lawd why dont that doctor come on here she moaned into the fire tears sliding out of her sticky eyes she had not washed since snooks took sick five days ago and a long row of whitish snail tracks laced her ashen face what you ought to try is some of the old home remedies sarah urged she was an old neighbor lady who wore magic leaves round her neck sewed up in possum skin next to a dried lizards foot she knew how magic came about and could do magic herself people said we going to have us a doctor  rannie toomer walked over and shooed a fat winter fly from her childs forehead i dont believe in none of that swamp magic she said all the old home remedies i took when i was a child just come short of killing me snooks under a pile of faded quilts made a small gravelike mound in the bed his head was like a ball of black putty wedged between the thin covers and the dingy yellow pillow his little eyes were partly open as if he were peeping out of his hard wasted skull at the chilly room and the forceful pulse of his breathing caused a faint rustling in the sheets near his mouth like the wind pushing damp papers in a shallow ditch what time you reckon that white doctorll git here asked sarah emphasizing the doctors color and trying to catch the childs breathing above the wind outside not expecting rannie toomer to answer her she sat with her old knees wide apart under many apron tails and long dark skirts heavy with stains from time to time she reached long cracked fingers down to sweep her damp skirts away from the live coals it was almost spring but the winter cold still clung to her bones and she had to almost sit in the fireplace to be warm her deep sharp eyes set in the rough leather of her face had aged a moist hesitant blue that gave her a quick dull stare like a hawk if she had ever lost faith in magic nobody knew about it for nobody  could remember old sarah without her roots and dead cats she just appeared suddenly when something strong was needed the greatest piece of magic in itself some said that they had ever seen now she gazed coolly at rannie toomer and rapped the hearth stones with her stick white mailman white doctor she chanted darkly under her breath as if to banish spirits they gotta come see bout this baby rannie toomer said wistfully whod go and ignore a little sick baby like my snooks she asked some folks we dont know so well as we thinks we do might the old lady replied what you want to give that boy of yours is one or two of the old home remedies arrowsroot or sassyfrass and cloves or a sugar tit soaked in cats blood rannie toomers face went tight we dont need none of your witchs remedies she cried grasping her baby by his shrouded toes trying to knead life into him like she kneaded limberness into flour dough we going to git some of them shots that makes peoples well curesem of all they ails cleansem out and makesem strong all at the same time she spoke upward from her sons feet as if he were an altar doctorll be here soon baby she whispered to him then rose to look out the grimy window i done sent the mailman she rubbed her face against the glass her flat nose more flattened as she peered out into the rain rannie toomer had gone down to the mailbox in the rain that morning hoping she hadnt missed the mailmans car she had watched from across the pasture since seven although she knew it wouldnt be along until a few minutes after ten like it always was she sat down on an old milk can that had been abandoned near the mailbox and turned her drooping face in the direction the mailmans car would come she had no umbrella and her coat was as thin and as short as a denim blouse her feet shivered inside thin clear plastic shoes that let in water and mud finally she saw him coming howde rannie mae the redfaced mailman said pleasantly as he always did when she stood by the car waiting to ask him something usually she wanted to ask what certain circulars meant that showed pretty pictures of things she needed did the circulars mean that somebody was coming around later and give her hats and suitcases and shoes and sweaters and rubbing alcohol and a heater for the house and a fur bonnet for her baby or why did he always give her the pictures if she couldnt have what was in them or what did the words say    especially the big word written in red sale he would explain shortly to her that the only way she could get the goods pictured on the circulars was to buy them in town and that town stores did their advertising by sending out pictures of their goods she would listen with her mouth hanging open until he finished then she would exclaim in a dull amazed way that she never had any money and he could ask anybody she couldnt ever buy any of the things in the picturesso why did the stores keep sending them to her he tried to explain to her that everybody got the circulars whether they had any money to buy with or not that this was one of the laws of advertising and he could not do anything about it he was sure she never understood what he tried to teach her about advertising for one day she asked him for any extra circulars he had and when he asked her what she wanted them forsince she couldnt afford to buy any of the items advertised she said she needed them to paper the inside of her house to keep out the wind today he thought she looked more ignorant than usual as she stuck her dripping head inside his car waiting for him to take away her dumbness and stupidity he recoiled from her breath before it reached him and gave little attention to what she was saying about her sick baby as he mopped up the water she dripped on the plastic door handle of the car well never can keepem dry i mean warm enough in rainy weather like this here he mumbled absently stuffing a wad of circulars advertising hairdryers and cold creams into her hands he wished she would stand back from his car so he could get going but she clung to the side gabbing away about snooks and newmonia and shots and how she wanted a real doctor to everything she said he nodded that right he injected sympathetically from time to time and from time to time he sneezed for she was letting in wetness and damp and he felt he was coming down with a cold black people as black as rannie toomer always made him uneasy especially when they didnt smell good and when you could tell they didnt right away rannie mae leaning in over him out of the rain smelled like a wet goat her dark dirty eyes clinging to his face with such hungry desperation made him nervous why did colored folks always want you to do something for them one of the reasons he had not wanted to take this job as rural mailman was because he would have to talk to colored people who never seemed to understand that it wasnt the mailmans duty to fetch doctors and deliver babies and set splints and take care of any other mizries they might have  now he cleared his throat and made a motion as if to roll up his window well ah mighty sorry to hear bout that little fella he said groping for the window crank well see what we can do he gave her what he hoped was a big friendly smile god he didnt want to hurt her feelings she looked so pitiful hanging there in the rain suddenly he had an idea whynt you try some of old aunt sarahs home remedies    he suggested brightly still smiling he halfbelieved with everybody else in the county that the old blueeyed black woman possessed magic magic that if it didnt work on whites probably would on blacks but rannie toomer almost turned the car over shaking her head and body with an emphatic no she reached in a wet crusted hand to grasp his shoulder we wants us a doctor a real doctor she screamed she had begun to cry and drop her tears on him you git us a doctor from town she bellowed shaking the solid shoulder that bulged under his warm coat like i say he drawled lamely although beginning to be furious with her well do what we can and he hurriedly rolled up the window and sped down the road cringing from the thought that she had put her nasty black hands on him old home remediesold home remedies rannie toomer had cursed the words while she licked at the hot tears that ran down her face the only warmth about her she turned backwards to the trail that led to her house trampling the wet circulars under her feet under the fence she went and was in a pasture surrounded by dozens of fat whitefolks cows and an old gray horse and a mule or two animals lived there in the pasture all around her house and she and snooks lived in it old sarah dug steadily at the fire the bones in her legs ached like they were sitting through a windy day outside the flesh that encased them white mailman white doctor white doctor white mailman she chanted from time to time putting the poker down carefully and rubbing her shins the young ones will turn to them she said when it is us olduns what got the power ? ? ? whynt you git away from that draff there by the winder she asked rannie toomer she had put together something hot in a dish and was drinking it from between cupped palms making her hands warm you going to catch your death of cold standing there looking for that white doctor that aint coming nohow he is coming too rannie toomer said angrily she wondered why she had bothered to let in the old woman when she came hobbling across the pasture to her m a    a    m a    a a  a door it was less than an hour after she had talked to the mailman that she looked up expecting the doctor and saw old sarah tramping through the grass on her walking stick she couldnt pretend she wasnt home with the smoke climbing out the chimney so she let her in making her leave her bag of tricks on the front porch old woman old as that ought to forgit trying to cure other people with her nigger magic ought to use some of it on herself she thought rannie would not let her lay a finger on snooks and warned the old woman if she tried anything she would knock her over the head with her own cane he coming alright rannie toomer said firmly looking straining her eyes to see through the rain let me tell you child the old woman said almost gently sipping from her dish he aint rannie toomer had not let her near the boy on the bed since she came in and that had made her angry but now she looked at the calloused bare heels of the young woman and smiled sadly marking the rejection of herself and the often queer fact that the young always grow up hoping when would this one know she mused that she could only depend on those who would come she thought the time was near across the room she had begun to pace but i told you rannie toomer said in exasperation i asked the mailman to bring a doctor for my snooks cold wind was shooting all around her from the cracks in the window framing faded circulars blew inward from the walls the old womans gloomy prediction made her tremble he done fetched the doctor the old woman said rubbing her dish with her hand what you reckon brung me over here in this here floodwont no desire to see no rainbows i can tell you rannie toomer paled s the doctor child the old woman turned to rannie with dull wise eyes that there white mailman didnt get no further with that message of yours then the road in front of my house lucky he got good lungsdeef as i is i had myself a time trying to make out what he was yelling rannie began to cry moaning suddenly the breathing of snooks from the bed seemed to drown out the noise of the downpour outside rannie toomer could feel his pulse making the whole house shake here she cried snatching up the baby and handing him to the old woman make him well o my lawd make him well old sarah rose from her seat by the fire and took the tiny baby already turning a purplish blue around the eyes and mouth lets not upset this little fella unnecessarylike she said placing the baby back on the bed gently  she began to examine him all the while moaning and humming some thin pagan tune that pushed against the sound of the wind and rain with its own melancholy power she stripped him of all his clothes poked at his fibreless baby ribs blew against his chest along his flat tiny back she ran her soft old fingers the child hung on in deep rasping sleep and his small glazed eyes neither opened fully nor fully closed rannie toomer swayed trancelike over the bed watching the old woman touching the baby she thought of the time she had wasted waidng for the real doctor her feeling of guilt was a stone ill do anything you say do aunt sarah she cried mopping at her nose with her dress anything you sayjust please god make him git better old sarah dressed the baby again and sat down in front of the fire she stayed deep in thought for several minutes rannie toomer gazed first into her silent face and then at the baby whose breathing seemed to have eased since sarah picked him up do something quick she urged sarah in her mind wanting to believe in her powers completely do something thatll make him rise up and call his mama the childs dying said the old woman bluntly staking out beforehand some limitation to her skill her powers were mostly those of a feeling heart availability and a desire to help that was the magic she had beyond the real doctor but she went on there might be something still we might do  what aunt sarah what rannie toomer was on her knees before the old womans chair wringing her hands and crying she had never been more frightened in her life she fastened hungry eyes on sarahs lips how could she have thought the white doctor could help her snooks she had to believe totally in the powers of the old woman all she could see for saving her snooks was hidden in the deep brooding eyes of the withered old magician before her what can i do she urged fiercely hearing the faint labored breathing from the bed it going to take a strong stomach said old sarah slowly it going to take a mighty strong stomach    and most you young peoples these days dont haveem snooks got a strong stomach rannie toomer cried looking anxiously into the serious old face it aint him thats got to have the strong stomach she said glancing down at the sobbing girl at her feet tom the one got to have the strong stomach  he wont know what it is hes drinking she turned her hooded blue eyes towards the bed rannie toomer began to tremble way down deep in her stomach it sure was weak she thought trembling like that but what could she mean her snooks to drink not cats blood and not some of the messes with chicken droppings shed heard sarah mixed up for people sick with colic what did she mean what is it she whispered bringing her head close to the firm sure knee sarah leaned over and put her toothless mouth to her ear the only thing that can save this child now is some good strong horse tea she kept her eyes on the girls face the only thing her face was grim and if you wants him out of that bed you better make tracks to git some rannie toomer took up her wet outdoors coat and stepped across the porch to the pasture the rain was falling against her face with the force of small hailstones she started walking in the direction of the trees where she could see bulky lightish shapes that looked like cows her thin plastic shoes were nearly sucked off in the mud but she pushed herself forward searching with her eyes for the lone gray mare the gray mare was under the trees with the cows all the animals shifted ground and rolled big dark eyes at rannie toomer she made as little noise as she could and leaned herself against a tree to wait thunder rose from the side of the sky like tires of a big truck rumbling over rough dirt road then it stood a split second in the middle of the sky before it exploded like a giant fire cracker then rolled away again like an empty keg lightning streaked across the sky setting the air white and charged rannie toomer stood dripping under her tree hoping not to be struck she kept her eyes carefully on the behind of the gray mare and after nearly an hour had passed the old horse began nonchalantly to spread her muddy knees at that moment rannie toomer realized that in her grief and upset she had brought nothing to catch the precious tea in lightning struck something not far off and caused a cracking and groaning from the sky and woods that frightened the animals into running away from their shelter rannie toomer slipped down in the mud trying to take off one of her plastic shoes to catch the tea and the gray mare trickling some made a break for another spot of shelter along with the other animals rannie toomer was close enough to the gray mare to catch the tea if she could keep up with the mare while she ran so alternately holding her breath and gasping for air she started after her mud from her fall clung to her elbows and streaked her frizzy hair slipping and sliding in the mud she raced after the big mare holding out as if for alms her plastic shoe    in the house the old woman sat with her shawls and sweaters tight around her rubbing her knees and muttering under her breath she heard the thunder felt the lightning that lit up the dingy room and turned her old wrinkled face to the bed hobbling over on stiff legs she could hear no sound the frail breathing had stopped with the thunder not to come again across the mudwashed pasture rannie toomer stumbled holding out her plastic shoe for the gray mare to fill in spurts and splashes mixed with rainwater she gathered her tea in parting the old mare snorted and threw up one big leg knocking rannie toomer back into the mud but she rose trembling and crying holding the shoe spilling none over the top but realizing a leak a tiny crack at her shoes front quickly she stuck her mouth there over the crack and ankle deep in the slippery mud of the pasture and freezing in her shabby wet coat she ran home to give the still warm strong horse tea to her baby snooks
hold still judy mrs h simmons said around the spray of pins that protruded dangerously from her mouth she gave the thirtieth tug to the tight sash at the waist of the dress now walk over there and turn around slowly the dress judys first long one was white organdy over taffeta with spaghetti straps that bared her round brown shoulders and a floating skirt and a wide sash that cascaded in a butterfly effect behind it was a dream but judy was sick and tired of the endless fittings she had endured so that she might wear it at the debutantes ball her thoughts leaped ahead to the ball itself    slowly i said mrs simmons dark angular face was always grim but now it was screwed into an expression resembling a prune judy starting nervously began to revolve by moving her feet an inch at a time her mother watched her critically no its still not right ill  just have to rip out that waistline seam again oh mother judys impatience slipped out at last nobodys going to notice all those little details they will too theyll be watching you every minute hoping to see something wrong youve got to be the best cant you get that through your head mrs simmons gave a sigh of despair you better start noticin all those little details yourself i cant do it for you all your life now turn around and stand up straight oh mother judy said close to tears from being made to turn and pose while her feet itched to be dancing i cant stand it any more you cant stand it huh how do you think i feel mrs simmons said in her harshest tone judy was immediately ashamed remembering the weeks her mother had spent at the sewing machine picking her already tattered fingers with needles and pins and the great weight of sacrifice that had been borne on mrs simmons shoulders for the past two years so that judy might bare hers at the ball all right take it off her mother said im going to take it up the street to mrs luby and let her help me its got to be right or i wont let you leave the house cant we just leave it the way it is mother judy pleaded without hope of success i think its perfect you would mrs simmons said tartly as she folded the dress and prepared to bear it out of the room sometimes i think ill never get it through your head you got to look just right and act just right that rose griffin and those other girls can afford to be careless maybe but you cant youre gonna be the darkest poorest one there judy shivered in her new lace strapless bra and her old childish knit snuggies you make it sound like a battle im going to instead of just a dance it is a battle her mother said firmly it starts tonight and it goes on for the rest of your life the battle to hold your head up and get someplace and be somebody weve done all we can for you your father and i now youve got to start fighting some on your own she gave judy a slight smile her voice softened a little youll do all right dont worry try and get some rest this afternoon just dont mess up your hair all right mother judy said listlessly she did not really think her father had much to do with anything that happened to her it was her mother who had ingratiated her way into the gay charmers two years ago taking all sorts of humiliation from the betterdressed betteroff lighterskinned women humbly making and mending their dresses fixing food for their meetings addressing more mail and selling more tickets than anyone else the club had put it off as long as they could but finally they had to admit mrs simmons to membership because she worked so hard and that meant of course that judy would be on the list for this years ball her father a quiet carpenter who had given up any other ambitions years ago did not think much of negro society or his wifes fierce determination to launch judy into it just keep clean and be decent he would say thats all anybody has to do her mother always answered if thats all  did wed still be on relief and he would shut up with shame over the years when he had been laid off repeatedly and her days work and sewing had kept them going now he had steady work but she refused to quit as if she expected it to end at any moment the intense energy that burned in mrs simmons large dark eyes had scorched her features into permanent irony she worked day and night and spent her spare time scheming and planning whatever her personal ambitions had been judy knew she blamed mr simmons for their failure now all her schemes revolved around their only child judy went to her mothers window and watched her stride down the street with the dress until she was hidden by the high brick wall  that went around two sides of their house then she returned to her own room she did not get dressed because she was afraid of pulling a sweater over her hairher mother would notice the difference even if it looked all right to judy and because she was afraid that doing anything even getting dressed might precipitate her into the battle she drew a stool up to her window and looked out she had no real view but she liked her room the wall hid the crowded tenement houses beyond the alley and from its cracks and bumps and depressions she could construct any imaginary landscape she chose it was how she had spent most of the free hours of her dreamy adolescence hey can i go it was the voice of an invisible boy in the alley as another boy chuckled judy recognized the familiar ritual if you said yes they said can i go with you it had been tried on her dozens of times she always walked past head in the air as if she had not heard her mother said that was the only thing to do if they knew she was a lady they wouldnt dare bother her but this time a girls voice cool and assured answered if you think you big enough it said it was lucy mae watkins judy could picture her standing there in a tight dress with bright brazen eyes im big enough to give you a baby the boy answered judy would die if a boy ever spoke to her like that but she knew lucy mae could handle it lucy mae could handle all the boys even if they ganged up on her because she had been born knowing something other girls had to learn aw you aint big enough to give me a shoeshine she told him come here and ill show you how big i am the boy said yeah lucy mae whats happenin another younger boy said come here and tell us lucy mae laughed what im puttin down is too strong for little boys like you come here a minute baby the first boy said i got a cigarette for you aw i aint studyin your cigarettes lucy mae answered but her voice was closer directly below judy there were the sounds of a scuffle and lucy maes muffled laughter when she spoke her voice sounded raw and cross come on now boy cut it out and give me the damn cigarette there was more scuffling and the sharp crack of a slap and then lucy mae said cut it out i said just for that im gonna take em all the clack of high heels rang down the sidewalk with a boys clumsy shoes in pursuit judy realized that there were three of them down there let her go buster one said you cant catch her now aw hell man she took the whole damn pack the one called buster complained thatll learn you lucy maes voice mocked from down the street dont mess with nothin you cant handle hey lucy mae hey i heard rudy grant already gave you a baby a second boy called out yeah is that true lucy mae the youngest one yelled there was no answer she must be a block away by now for a moment the hidden boys were silent then one of them guffawed directly below judy and the other two joined in the secret male laughter that was oddly highpitched and feminine aw man i dont know what you all laughin about buster finally grumbled that girl took all my cigarettes you got some leroy naw the second boy said me neither the third one said what we gonna do i aint got but fifteen cent hell man i want more than a feel for a pack of cigarettes there was an unpleasant whine in busters voice hell for a pack of cigarettes i want a bitch to come across she will next time man the boy called leroy said she better buster said you know she better if she pass by here again we gonna jump her you hear sure man leroy said the three of us can grab her easy then we can all three of us have some fun oh yeah man the youngest boy said he sounded as if he might be about  leroy said we oughta get roland and j t too for a whole pack of cigarettes she oughta treat all five of us aw man why tell roland and j t the youngest voice whined they aint in it them was our cigarettes they was my cigarettes you mean buster said with authority you guys better quit it before i decide to cut you out oh man dont do that we with you you know that sure buster we your aces man all right thats better there was a minute of silence then what we gonna do with the girl buster the youngest one wanted to know when she come back we gonna jump the bitch man we gonna jump her and grab her then we gonna turn her every way but loose he went on spinning a crude fantasy that got wilder each time he retold it until it became so secretive that their voices dropped to a low indistinct murmur punc tuated by guffaws now and then judy could distinguish the word girl or the other word they used for it these words always produced the loudest guffaws of all she shook off her fear with the thought that lucy mae was too smart to pass there again today she had heard them at their dirty talk in the alley before and had always been successful in ignoring it it had nothing to do with her the wall protected her from their kind all the ugliness was on their side of it and this side was hers to fill with beauty she turned on her radio to shut them out completely and began to weave her tapestry to its music more for practice than anything else she started by picturing the maps of the places to which she intended to travel then went on to the faces of her friends rose griffins sharp indian profile appeared on the wall her coloring was like an indians too and her hair was straight and black and glossy judys hair naturally none of these things had been done four days ago so that tonight it would be old enough to have a gloss as naturallooking as roses but rose despite her handsome looks was silly her voice broke constantly into highpitched giggles and she became even sillier and more nervous around boys judy was not sure that she knew how to act around boys either the sisters kept boys and girls apart at the catholic high school where her parents sent her to keep her away from lowclass kids but she felt that she knew a secret tonight in that dress with her hair in a sophisticated upsweep she would be transformed into a poised princess tonight all the college boys her mother described so eagerly would rush to dance with her and then from somewhere the boy would appear she did not know his name she neither knew nor cared whether he went to college but she imagined that he would be as dark as she was and that there would be awe and diffidence in his manner as he bent to kiss her hand    a waltz swelled from the radio the wall turning blue in deepening twilight came alive with whirling figures judy rose and began to go through the steps she had rehearsed for so many weeks she swirled with a practiced smile on her face holding an imaginary skirt at her side turned dipped and flicked on her bedside lamp without missing a fraction of the beat faster and faster she danced with her imaginary partner to an inner music that was better than the sounds on the radio she was coming out and tonight the world would discover what it had been waiting for all these years aw git it baby she ignored it as she would ignore the crowds that lined the streets to watch her pass on her way to the ball aw do your number she waltzed on safe and secure on her side of the wallcan i come up there and do it with you at this she stopped paralyzed somehow they had come over the wall or around it and into her room man i sure like the view from here the youngest boy said how come we never tried this view before she came to life ran quickly to the lamp and turned it off but not before buster said yeah and the back view is fine too aw she turned off the light a voice complained put it on again baby we dont mean no harm let us see you dance some more i bet you can really do it yeah i bet she can shimmy on down you know it man come on down here baby busters voice urged softly dangerously i got a cigarette for you yeah and he got something else for you too judy flattened against her closet door gradually lost her urge to scream she realized that she was shivering in her underwear taking a deep breath she opened the closet door and found her robe she thought of going to the window and yelling down you dont have a thing i want do you understand but she had more important things to do wrapping her hair in protective plastic she ran a full steaming tub and dumped in half a bottle of her mothers favorite cologne at first she scrubbed herself furiously irritating her skin but finally she stopped knowing she would never be able to get cleaner than this again she could not wash away the thing they considered dirty the thing that made them pronounce girl in the same way as the other fourletter words they wrote on the wall in the alley it was part of her just as it was part of her mother and rose griffin and lucy mae she relaxed then because it was true that the boys in the alley did not have a thing she wanted she had what they wanted and the knowledge replaced her shame with a strange calm feeling of power after her bath she splashed on more cologne and spent  minutes on her makeup erasing and retracing her eyebrows six times until she was satisfied she went to her mothers room then and found the dress finished and freshly pressed on its hanger when mrs simmons came upstairs to help her daughter she found her sitting on the bench before the vanity mirror as if it were a throne she looked young and arrogant and beautiful and perfect and cold why youre dressed already mrs simmons said in surprise while she stared judy rose with perfect icy grace and glided to the center of the room she stood there motionless as a mannequin i want you to fix the hem mother she directed its still uneven in back her mother went down obediently on her knees muttering it looks all right to me she put in a couple of pins that better yes judy said with a brief glance at the mirror youll have to sew it on me mother i cant take it off now id ruin my hair mrs simmons went to fetch her sewing things returned and surveyed her daughter you sure did a good job on yourself i must say she admitted grudgingly cant find a thing to complain about youll look as good as anybody there of course mother judy said as mrs simmons knelt and sewed i dont know what you were so worried about her secret feeling of confidence had returned stronger than ever but the evening ahead was no longer the vague girlish fantasy she had pictured on the wall it had hard clear outlines leading up to a definite goal she would be the belle of the ball because she knew more than rose griffin and her silly friends more than her mother more even than lucy mae because she knew better than to settle for a mere pack of cigarettes there her mother said breaking the thread she got up i never expected to get you ready this  early ernest lee wont be here for another hour that silly ernest lee judy said with a new contempt in her young voice until tonight she had been pleased by the thought of going to the dance with ernest lee he was nice she felt comfortable with him and he might even be the awestruck boy of her dream he was a dark serious neighborhood boy who could not afford to go to college mrs simmons had reluctantly selected him to take judy to the dance because all the gay charmers sons were spoken for now with an undertone of excitement judy said im going to ditch him after the first dance mother youll see im going to come home with one of the college boys its very nice ernest lee she told him an hour later when he handed her the white orchid but its rather small im going to wear it on my wrist if you dont mind and then dazzling him with a smile of sweetest cruelty she stepped back and waited while he fumbled with the door you know edward im not worried about her any more mrs simmons said to her husband after the children were gone her voice became harsh and grating put down that paper and listen to me arent you interested in your child thats better she said as he complied meekly i was saying i do believe shes learned what ive been trying to teach her after all
the whole damn t thing is berthas fault bertha is my roommate and a very black person to put it mildly shes a revolutionary i dont want to spend needless time discussing bertha but its sort of important before i met her i was ayn randbarry goldwater all the way bertha kept asking how could black people be conservative what have they got to conserve and after a while realizing that i had absolutely nothing period i came around but not as fast as she was moving it wasnt enough that i learned to like the regular mass of colored peopleas a whole as it werebut she wanted me to like the individual colored people that we knew i resisted that like hell but eventually came around bertha is the sort of person where eventually you come around now just be patient you want to know why im late dont you so i got an afro and began the conference beat and did all those black things that we were supposed to do i even gave up white men for the movement    and that was no easy sacrifice not that they were that good  nobody come down with a sister like a brotherbut they were a major source of support for me i agreed that they shouldnt be allowed to support the movement but i believe in income being passed around and if anyone has income to spare whiteys do so i cut myself off from a very important love of mine  money  and that presented a problem no im not going round  robinhoods barn this is a part of it so when my income was terminated for ideological reasons youd think shed say something like ill take over the rent and your gas bill since youve sacrificed so much for the movement youd really think that wouldnt you but no she asked me about a job a job for christs sake i didnt even know anybody who worked but her and here she was talking bout a job i calmly suggested that i would apply for relief you see i believe society owes all of its members certain things like food clothing shelter and gas so i was going to apply to society since individual contributions were no longer acceptable she laughed that cynical laugh of hers and offered to go down with me no says i i can do it myself so i went down at the end of the week now im a firm believer in impressions i think the first impression people make is very important and since i would have to consider welfare my job from now on for berthas sake at least i got dressed up and went down im sure youve applied for relief at least once so you know the procedure i went to intake and met an old civil servant the kind whose been on the job since hayes set the system up she asked me so many questions about my personal life i thought she was interviewing me for a possible spot in heaven then we got to my family i told her mommy was a supervisor in the welfare department and that daddy was a social  worker she shook her head and looked disgustedjust plain disgusted with mehuffed up her flat chest and said young lady you are not eligible for relief and stormed away i started after her what the hell do you mean eligible  i asked ill take somebodys job who really needs it somebody with skills or the ability to be trained with a wife and kids or maybe just an unwed mother will be put out of work what kind of jive agency are you you sure dont give a damn about people as she turned the corner i had to run to keep up with her and who are you to decide what i need you nothing but a jive petty bourgeoisie bullcrap civil servant yes i did i told her exactly that i mean thats what she is going round deciding peoples needs you got needs yourself who decides how your needs gonna be filled you aint god or mary or even the holy ghost telling me what im eligible for and i was laying her out the nerve id come all the way down there and didnt have on levis or my miniskirt but looked nice i mean really clean and she says im not eligible really did piss me off at the end of the corridor where she was hurrying to i saw this figure it looked real small and pitiful like it was mommy i guess someone had recognized me and called her to come down i went over to put my arms around her dont cry mommy itll be all right but she just cried and cried and kept saying oh kim why cant you be like other daughters i got so involved with soothing her that the servant got away mom i said as i walked her to her office theres going to be a black revolution all over the world and we must prepare for it weve got to determine our own standards of eligibility thats all she quit crying a little and just looked at me pitifully then she put her arms around me and said oh kim i love you but why cant you just get married and divorced and have babies and things like other daughters why do you have to disgrace us like this i didnt mind when you got kicked out of school for drinking and i even got used to all those men i didnt like and remember the time you made the front page for doing that gogo dance at the democratic convention ive been a democrat all my life you know that but i was proud that in the middle of johnsons speech you jumped on the table shoes and all to dance your protest to the war in vietnam but this is my job your father and i have worked very hard to give you everything we could mom i cut her off im not against your job i tried to explain it wasnt personal even when i had to throw that rock through her office window that time we didnt fire bomb did we no i told the group dont fire bomb the welfare department and when we had to turn the directors car over you noticed that he didnt get hurt i told the group be sure not to hurt the director thats what i told them but mom im broke now  all my savings are gone and if i dont get on relief ill have to take a job oh mommy what will i do if i take a job locked up in a building with all those strangers for eight hours every day and people saying good morning kim hows it going or hey kim what you doing after work i mean getting familiar with me and i dont even know them how could i stand that then for the first time in the  years ive known her she looked me dead in the eyei mean exactly straightand said youll either have to work or go to grad school it floored me i mean shes never made a decision like that all the time ive known her mom i said you dont mean it youve been talking to bertha youre angry with me for what i told that civil servant ill apologize ill make it up somehow i swear ill get my hair done but she would not budge kim its school or a job mom member when i went back and graduated from college magna cum laude and all member how proud you and daddy were that i had the guts to go back after all they did to me in college member what you said member how you said i had done all you wanted me to do member how you kept saying you wouldnt ask me for nothing else member mom mom member but she wouldnt budge i tell you its something when your own mother turns against you she knew i was working for revolution what would happen to the revolution if i quit to take a job what would my people do i asked her and she looked at me and said rather coldly if i recall your people need you to lead the way not just toward irresponsible acts but toward a true revolution theres nothing irresponsible about chaos and anarchy we must brush our teeth before eating a meal kim ive read everything you have written ive heard on tape all your speeches and what are you talking about now program ive read frantz fanon and stokely carmichael i especially enjoyed burn the honky by h rap brown hes got an amazing sense of humor ive read killens and jones and neal and mckissick ive read most of the books on those lists you gave us havent i always tried to understand you and sympathize with you when i was going to get mother a cook book did i buy la gastronomiquel no i bought the ebony cook book even though mother has forgotten more than freda deknight could ever have known when your father and i went to the social work convention in detroit last year did we stay with the other delegates at the hilton no we stayed at the rio grande ive done all i could for the revolution and ill probably do more but im not going to allow you this behavior you will get a job or you will go to school aw mom i protested you just dont understand    kim thats all there is to it ill give you a surprise when you tell me something definite i was crushed absolutely crushed my own mother turned against me i must have looked terribly hurt because she kissed me again and said oh kim its best really it is if i can read your people and try to understand your way you can try mine i called my father i asked him to take me to lunch i think he knew he didnt know when i called him but by the time we met for lunchhe knew course being a social worker and relating to people and all for a living he didnt just burst in and say i agree with your mother no he sat down and ordered me a drink he doesnt drink anymore since he and his liver made an intellectual decision that negroes shouldnt get high this is his sacrifice for the movement of course he quit five years ago when he was in the hospital he considered it a religious conversion thing his own special sacrifice to jesus we used to ask about it but he always just said jesus had spoken to him through his liver and nothing would shake him he quit church after a couple of months but he continued to tithe every month faithfully and never drank again his tennis game improved and he  got to be a good swimmer again he took up golf and to tell the truth had gotten so damned cleancutamerican that mommy began sneaking gin into his eggs every morning just to keep him from becoming a real bastard he doesnt know that however so we sat down and i had a drink and we ordered lunch whats on your mind chicken he always calls me some sort of animal or inanimate object im not sure what his message is i didnt want to throw it on him right away daddymonmysaysivegottogotoschoolortakeajobandidontthinkthatsfair i said uhmm would you say that again in english  i mean american mommy says i have to go to school or get a job good lambiepie which one is it daddy you dont understand i dont think its fair of course not sugar lump she shouldnt have said it like that you just get yourself a nice job you dont even have to consider school ill call up harry white and see what he can do for you course you can get one on your own    you just let me know what you would like oh daddy i said youre on her side and shes been talking to bertha and nobody even understands me  i try to understand you angel cake ive read almost all those books on your lists and everything youve written and ive heard all your speeches i think youre doing fine work but you must set an example too you just show your people that new systems can be created if you want to destroy something you must first learn how it works and what need its filling after thehow you say black flameencases the world youll want your people to work for the black nation how can you encourage that if you have no idea what youre asking of them thats one thing i noticed about everyone from nkrumah to ben bella to brown they dont really know what theyre asking everydaypeople to do not that they dont work and hardbut do they punch a time clock do they have a  minute lunch break do they dig ditches work in a mine not that they have to do everyone of those but have they labored have they punched a time clock its important that they do and all the readand writing in the world doesnt give a true understanding of time clocks maybe theyll do away with time clocks but they must first understand what purpose they serve before they do oh daddy not that many black folks ever punch a clock im not talking just about a clock and you know it im talking about going to work on time eating lunch on time getting off on time going home on time all those meetings conferences and rallieseven if they are on time are scheduled to your and their conveniencenot the peoples get up at  or  go downtown eat lunch with a couple of thousand people relate to your supervisor relate to your clients relate to the people in your office or sewer get off at  or  rush home read your paper while your wife cooks dinner talk to your children listen to their troubles put them to bed talk to your wife listen to her troubles take her to bed and in your spare time watch tv say hello to your neighbor run to the store go to a rally try to read a book try that and you might understand why the revolution as you call it moves so slowly oh daddy i didnt want a lecture i just wanted you to be on my side is that my name now ohdaddy i am on your side brown sugar thats why im telling you this get yourself a job then do all the things youre doing you may readjust your methods i wont change i wont let the bourgeoisie system get me i didnt say your thinking kim i didnt say you would readjust your thinking i said you may change your methods lunch was ruined for me i went home to type a resume and that wasnt easy it had been that kind of a day i have this really neato pink ibmit was a gift though when i got it it was a downpayment its always worked right ive had it for twoandahalf years and never had a bit of trouble once a year i call the people and they clean and service itthats it its a dream but that day of all days it just wouldnt work right the s was skipping and the a was hitting twice plus the magic margin wouldnt click in and it was just a f    y day i quit and stretched out on the floor i fell sort of half asleep i couldnt decide between school or an agency job and it must have been on my mind cause i had this really terrible dream there was this university chasing me down the streets i turned the corner to get away from it and ran right into the mouth of an agency it gobbled me up but it couldnt digest me when it tried to swallow me i put up such a fight that it belched me back into life as i hit the street there was this university again waiting for me like a big dyke that has run her prey into a corner with a greasy smile on her lips i woke up screaming both of them would destroy me and furthermore what did i need with a masters degree as i brooded on my future the image of educational institutions kept coming back going to school is like throwing the rabbit into a briar patch there would be scores of students that i could convert and because of academic freedom the school would have to accept and support me or at least leave me alone unless i flunked out drank a lot or smoked in public and if i applied in social work both mommy and daddy would be pleased cause id get a degree and agency training and an inadequate paycheck to boot so i sat down at my pink ibm to type a letter for an application blank surprisingly enough the typewriter was fixed i mailed it immediately and sat back while others stronger and wiser than i determined my fate geeze youve got a one track mind im trying to get around to explaining about the delay i was you know accepted in school i thought everyone would be happy and leave me alone that was february and i had nine months of freedom before enrollment day and i fully intended to use them i got my acceptance letter on a tuesday that was so upsetting that all i could do for a long time was just gnash and growl it didnt bother bertha a bit cause she just started running round the house singing kims going to school   you know like she was happy my mood wasnt too positive so i told her dead calmly that if she didnt get the heck out of my half of the apartment id kill her she laughed one of those grand ha ha ha type things then spread her arms and pirouetted out the door it was hard to take after these years of free dom of choice and movement i was going back to school i just cried and cried then i thought what the hell hadnt i survived the time we were playing the prince of wales hadnt i survived the wisconsin sleeper hadnt i been to harlem hadnt i refused to lay a white boy when we were in mississippi on the big march why wouldnt i survive now i was really talking it up to myself much worse things had happened to me and here i was acting like a cry baby why wouldnt i survive i asked myself bravely boldly perhapsbrazenly why would i not survive because  came the answer and i just cried and cried ive got to tell you this no dont be that waylisten if ever something happens to you that makes you real unhappy and youve just got to cry about it dont cry in the same spot move around thats what i learned after i cried and cried there was this shiny puddle around my feet and there were these bloodred eyes looking up at me i learned then never cry in one spot but i was cool with it i never really became emotionally involved in it i cleaned up the mess took a shower got dressed to a t then went out walking the streets i stopped by this bar i know and had a drink one of my brothers soul brothers bought me a drink and we started discussing what would have to come down he and i got into a real deep thing and we talked until the bar closed he kept wanting to kill toms and i still think thats not who we have to kill toms i told him only have power if we let them have power i mean if a tom says get off the streets and you get off the streets then thats your fault not his if on the other hand a tom tells you to get off the streets and you dont well then the power structure has no use for himplus if you can encourage him in a physical way to come on over to your side youve made a friend i mean you can beat anyone or boycott them or something besides killing a brother to get him to either help you or get out of the way there are too few brothers on this shore already to be killing each other off we need to get rid of whitey i mean if we cant kill a whitey how can we ever justify killing a brother thats a hell of a copout to me talking bout killing brothersand sisters tooand not being able to kill a whitey the only way we can ever justify offing a brother is if we have already offed  whiteysthats the ratio i told him for offing a brother so we went to his place to talk farther the next morning all my problems were solved i thought i had figured it all out now this much i knew about social work school they will put up with anything at all except heterosexual relations i mean anything at all and the school where i was accepted was founded by two ladies who had adopted children i just knew if i wrote them and explained that i had not only been screwing but had enjoyed itwell i thought theyd write a nice letter explaining the mistake in accepting me and that would be the end of that so i jumped up and dashed home to compose a letter then i thought that wont get to them soon enough id better send a wire so i did to the school of social work directorof placement please be advised stop i have screwed stop it was good stop so there explanation point yours in freedom kim i thought that they would really be sick of me the minute they receive that i got a long involved letter explaining how proud they were that i was open to new things and that they were very pleased at my level of honesty i tell you i was peed thats the only way to describe it and what the heck did she mean new things id been screwing since i was  ten if you want to count the times before it was serious and he wasnt new anyway i was truly indignant but bertha discouraged me from expressing my feelings to the school by just demoralizing my whole intellectual thing well yes it was a calculated intellectual involvement you see i never act on my unabridged emotions emotions are to be controlled by the intellect even when i act in what could be considered an emotional manner i have thought it out before and have decided this will be the way i act so to have my whole intellectual bag blown sky high right before my eyes well that was frightening i started to give bertha a quick punch in the gut but my whole actionreaction syndrome began to reek of emotion so i just cooled it a bit and dropped a half teaspoon of drano in her coffee later during the day strange about that i was only playing a little joke and there was plenty of milk on hand you see to help offset the effects so bertha drank her coffee and went to the john and never once indicated that anything was wrong later when i asked she did say it had been awfully runny but that was all im a failure i told myselfa failure oh goody im a failure i dont have to deal with it anymore i dashed a telegram off to the director of placement please be advised stop have put drano in roommates coffee stop she lives stop i am a failure you must reject me stop those ridiculous people up there just considered it a bid for attention i got a nice long letter explaining how they realized i hadnt  received my placement yet and they were sorry but that they had a lot of work and sometimes even the best of us get tied down etc plus if you can dig it they think i have ingenious way of letting them know my needs i mean really ingenious goddamit i am a failure if i dont find a decent quick way out of this why ill end up in an institutiona part of an agencybeing decent responsibleall those ugly sick things that i hate id really have to think of a scheme it was way in the middle of april before it even dawned on me i mean it was so simple that i was overlooking the obvious what is the one thing we know for damned sure about white people i mean you know beside the fact that they hate negroes children and sex    what is the one thing we know absolutely and positively about any honkie anywhere in the world that he worships money hes got such a case on money hes transferred it to anything green thats why you see those goddam keep off the grass signs not that he cares about grass but that its green whats the quickest way to turn a honkie off ask him for money hes as nice as he can be as long as he thinks hell get your moneybut the minute you ask him for some well thats like asking a hippie for his pot or a negro for his knife i mean they get hostile you dont believe it go into any bank and deposit five bucks then go back in a week and with draw it when you go to deposit it theyre all smiles the vp will come out and shake your hand the teller smiles and welcomes you to the family and thats only five bucks im talking about when you go to withdraw it the first thing the teller will say is you realize this will close your account just like you didnt know that if you deposit five bucks and you withdraw five bucks that you were closing your account and you just smile at him and say yeah groovy hell frown and say this will cost you one dollar and you say cool gimme my four bucks then he says this will take a minute thats when you look at him very menacingly and say i should surely hope the hell not then hell slam your money down and scream next or hell slap the next window please sign up and turn his back on you and this is a black teller im talking about so knowing this i wrote the director of placement and told her i had no money that i needed a stipend and a tuition grant i just knew for whatever my charm or whatnot that they werent going to pay me to go to their school i mean as tight as they are they are not about to give me any money i was as happy as a yearold turkey the day before thanksgivingi knew i now had them by the assi was just naturally too tough to handle i walked a little taller breathed a little deeper felt a little prouder i was so happy that i went back to my revolutionary work not that i hadnt been working for revolution all alongbut i had really been hung up on this thing about a job we set up a black arts festival and i was working my youknowwhatoff you may have heard about me being on the radio telling all the honkies not to come im sure you heard about lonnie going into the honkie neighborhood with his sign saying youre not ready it was great advertisement for us and we were all really sorry about that kid however though the papers played it down after the first day it is not true that lonnie tore his leg from the jointhe only fractured it and contrary to first reports the kid will walk again i personally tell all the brother black belts i know that they shouldnt provoke white kids then beat on them but well youre not always able to control folks even if they do take a lot of your advice but that was the only incident that could be in some quarters considered unfortunate it was a groovy set the blue beasts foamed at the mouth but it was our day i say again it was revolutionary slavetown usa was back in the movement cause the kim was back into her thing i really forgot all that crap about school and jobs and do i just put it out of my mind our underground press yes it does have something to do with why im late you see we were putting out a magazine called love black it was a group thing you know but it really belonged to all the people we had learned the secret of why the folks dont read cmon see do you know you jive they can too read but nobody ever writes for them or writes anything they can relate to so having figured that out through the very difficult process of stopping every brother we could on the corner one day and asking them what they would enjoy reading we went about getting love black out see most folks dont read honkies especially but people too you think they really read gh or time they look at the pictures and will scan any article they can see the end of most people like to read what they can see the end of so we started a black mag on  vi x  with articles that ran a page or less also it doesnt run over  pages all toto therefore a brother can read the whole damned thing mag and really do two things learn something positive about himself and complete something he started now dont start breaking into my explanation it may well be propaganda but all pieces of paper with writing are propaganda and if i have to deal in mindcontrol its much better to be black washed i mean the honkie press and stuff just naturally screws with any black mans mind cause first it doesnt recognize that there is a black mind it does what it can to a black mindit whitewashes it it  flushes it out of his head thats what it does but we were giving  the people something and we were getting a lot one issue we were late and all kinds of soul stepped up and told me if i didnt get my thing together and get the mag out well they would look upon that with disfavor and they also sent articles in like wed get slightly used toilet tissue with an article on it or brown paper bags with short sayings or just a note to say they dig us some of it looked like our ancestral writing egyptian and we really had to work at deciphering it but when you saw how the man changed after he had published well it would really hit you you see the brother will read if hes writing it or if he knows people who are and love black was strictly ours it wasnt the prettiest thing in the world and sometimes it wasnt too clear ive always maintained that if we lose the revolution itll be because we know nothing about machinery but it was ours it talked about slavetown and what the brother thought and felt and the brother was digging it you got to understand the whole concept of writing like in the east everything is dishonest they do a lot of things but mostly its three thousand per cent b s the people are so used to talking black buying black and thinking black they dont get shook no more every hustler why is it a black capitalist is called a hustler and every panhandler is black so black dont mean nothing its taken for granted and one black thing is like another theyve been saturated with a program that has never come off between garvey and malcolm harlem should be owned lock stock and barrel by usbut we are still trying to get rat control and jobs and paying rent to circumcised honkies in the dupont plantation state they even passed a law that said if building codes arent lived up to you can deposit your money in one of the company banks and leave it then til the cat comes round aint that the jivest crap you ever heard of i mean paternalism with a capital white no wait a minute if you live in a house or apartment and something is wrong with it and you are living there everyday the good lord makes you black well you should fix that place up and whats left over from rent should go in your pocket so the old witch from the welfare department comes down and tries to explain that shell have to hold your check if you dont pay your rent to the rightful owner and thats when you come out of your thing so righteously and whip it on her so beautifully you just light up a joint and calmly explain that honkies have made women bombs and kellogs corn flakes but they have never made a piece of land the land is one bitch that is everybodys woman and i being man and all have got a right to a piece of her you see the honkies whole sex thing is tied up to land no lie land is their love all land except germany is female the motherland her sheall land is woman and they do anything to prove that they are worthy to be lands man only land dont give a crap about white people see land has this memory thing land remembers god stepped out on space and looked around and said ill make me a man god reached down into land a woman and formed this thingyou know a man now land has always been black and you know god well enough to know that he goes firstclass so god got the best land he could find which had to be the blackest land he could find you just dont know about no white land snow maybe some white sand maybe but you just dont know about no white land and land is hip to that land is very put out that we are making her prostitute herself for the beast you didnt hear about no land being raped until the beast came along we live in harmony with land because we are a part of land and we are out of land the honky came from sand and snow now what is that thats nothing it has a place on earth but its nothing snow freezes land and sand dries her up both destroy land and land wants to live and recreate you run it on down to where you are going to free land so that she can go about womans work of taking care of her childrenthe black people of the earth now shell send the law out but that dont mean nothing either the law only means something if you think it does so shell send out the law to make you pay and you smile sincerely and promise to get it in next week after youre alone with your piece of land you remove very carefully anything that cannot be replaced like pictures of your first lay your joints etc and you throw kerosene on everything else you see its yours and if you cant enjoy it in freedom and peace then land wants you to destroy it you cant destroy land because itll always be there but you can destroy the rapists claim stake the only thing about that land that makes the beast think he owns it is the claim hes stakeda house a building a fenceso you destroy that thats when you burn you dont bum to get the thief to fix it up you burn when youve staked your claim and they try to steal it from you and i really believe that after youve fixed it up and made it yours youll kill for it thats the one thing weve got to understand this revolution isnt to show what were willing to die for black people have been willing to die for damned near everything on earth its to show what were willing to kill for yes it is do we love life enough to deal  righteously with key honkies we dont have to deal with king and young and those other three or four if we dont want to we have got to deal with the folks who send them up which means we have to control ourselves i have got to control me and you have got to control you like if i see something that needs to be done and you see something else we dont got to argue about what to do you do yours and ill do mine its like were on a road that forks off then comes back together we just had different priorities and that dont make one right or wrong just different but if i use the fact that you want to do something i dont want to do to keep from doing what i have to do then im not together im b sing and i know it see you and i are never in a conflict situation cause were after the same thingwere after the same honky and however we get him is our business all that jive about coordination and keeping people in line and elites and crap dont really mean nothing thats not revolutionthats not anarchy and anarchy is what we want this country doesnt have anything that we cant build again if we need it but to even try to think of taking over and preserving gm or something what for nobodys trying to make the system black were trying to make a system human so that black folks can live in it that means were trying to destroy the system its not even a question of whether black folks can run it better than white folks we dont have to prove to whities that we canand if we take over their system thatll be the reason we havent got to prove nothing to honkies cause they are nobodys authority on nothing but the whole damn thing i do blame on bertha cause i was just as happy sitting at home twittering my toes and masturbating every now and then i didnt even know that i was colored let alone anything about blackness but she kept bringing those beautiful black people home and they kept talking that talk to me and as i moved i moved toward black_power and i recognized the extent of white power which is so pervasive that the american solution cannot be black_power at all though as a world solution it is a possibility but must be revolutionanarchy total chaosand this should not be so hard for us since we have worked so diligently in every other cause we can now work for our own we have sacrificed our lives and interests for white power and now we can save ourselves through revolutionour baptism by fire but as i worked this out people kept calling me a hater and really im a lover no one knows how much i do love all that is lovable then bertha chimed in to ask do i love black folks enough to trust them to tcb and do i trust black people to do those things necessary by any means necessary recognizing that the means is in fact the ends she kept saying that if they and i are one then i should get out of the way and see where they would go without me and since revolution ages you so quickly and having watched the summer i had to admit that i was old and tired and recognized that already we were moving beyond my vision so maybe i should step aside and regroup so i packed and made arrangements to come to school and everybody cheered and was really pleased with my decision and i kept telling myself that it would be good and that i was dealing with the best the system had to offer and that if i couldnt relate meaningfully enough to them for me to accept them then i could easily go back to destroying it in a very real manner so having made my decision i decided to walk i mean it would have been much too tjh to hop a flight or thumb a ride ana though physical punishment of m self doesnt negate the total import of my act it did serve as a human extension of myself to help offset my total feeling of wasting my time and i had no idea you were so far away from uncle toms cabin in slavetown i had thought i could make it in a day or two but its taking much longer im really sorry about holding you up and all but its done now and here i am see can you handle it
soon one morning the wheels of  years of slavery ceased turn the i dont to know precise way in which it happened but i can sketch the events for you the sun had just started coming the semidarkness the at the gate of up and in men gathered white plantation the fence some elbows some support for their backs no one was nervous the they leaned on resting on their using the fence as a theyd all time a few much waiting though waiting a long make veyed the leaving the and nurtured they had been more minutes couldnt difference they surland which they were land they had coaxed from which each which brought forth seas of cotton none of them supposed that he would miss this place each had been moving all his life trying to find someplace where his work would do him some good where after five or six years of labor he could have enough set aside so that his wife and children could rest from the crippling work in the fields ironically most of them had come over to this place in the miss ssippi delta from the hills expecting to find a land of opportunity they had been told that they could make a lot of money over in the deltas cottonfields so they had left sharecropping in the hills slipping off in the night so that the bossman wouldnt know they were going they owed him money he had furnished them so that they could livethat is subsisteach year to produce another crop for him old man brown twisted around so that he leaned sideways on the gate even though he was in his fifties he was still a handsome man his skin a reddish brown his black hair richly mixed with grey closing his eyes to the growing brilliance of the sun he chewed on a long blade of grass and thought back over the years he had invested in this land it had been a long time since hed done thisthink back mostly he had applied his energies to coping with the present to making it through a day in the field to stretching a dollar to feed  people      the past for the old man was his big girl frankie mae she was his first child bom  years ago shed lain in the fields while he and his wife mattie made their first crop and when they lived in the hills she had gone everywhere with him he had a blue bicycle with a rusty wire basket in the front he used to put frankie mae in the basket and ride her to town with him and to church and sometimes they would go nowhere special just riding she fitted so well into the basket that for a few years the old man thought that the basket was growing with the child but when frankie reached six she became too large to ride with him also he had four more children by then so he bought a car for  not long after frankie mae stopped riding in the basket he became restless he had heard about how you could make a lot of money over in the delta so he decided to go over there he packed what he could carry in one loadthe children a few chickens and a mattressand slipped off one night frankie mae sat next to him on the drive chattering while he drove excited about the promising new place where they would live when a tire blew out she would climb out to help him while the others slept she knew the tools to be used and would bring them to him just the minute before he turned to ask for them at six she was a beautiful black child with delicate limbs and huge green eyes that seemed to glow in the dark she was always alive and happy the only thing wrong was that she got hurt so easily the slightest rebuke sent her crying the least hint of disapproval left her moody and depressed for hours on the other hand she had a way of springing back from pain no matter how hurt she was she would be her old self by the next day the old man worried over her he wanted most to cushion her life to protect her from the sharp points on which he had been cut he understood later that that was why he had moved to the delta maybe he would be able to make enough to get her out of the south get her some clothes and put her into a nice school somewhere two days after they left the hills they drove up to the white plantation in leflore county mississippi they were given a creaky tworoom house and told the conditions of their stay they would work  acres on shares percent to them and  to the bossman the fertilizer the packaging and any other such expenses would be deducted from their  percent they would be furnished  a month for living expenses while they were making the crop the old man and mattie worked hard that year up at  breakfast of grits and syrup then out to the field frankie mae stayed behind to nurse the other children and to watch the pot of beans which was cooking for dinner at noon they would come in and eat with  the children and then be gone again until dark they would drag themselves home eat some bread and syrup and get ready for the next daydo a little sweeping snap some beans wash for the baby then they would sit on the porch together for maybe a half hour that was the time the old man liked best the half hour before bed frankie mae would tell him the events of the daya man from town had come by and tried to take their stove because they were three months behind in their payments frankie had told him she had just that morning seen a money order come in the mail from uncle ed and she had heard her daddy say he was going to use it to pay off the stove man the man believed the story and left the stoveor she would tell how willie b the three year old had wandered off the porch and hit his head on a rock she had carried him down the road to the woman they called granny who was too old to work in the fields but who stayed resolutely on in her little shack she said i know mr white junior aint gonna put me out it dont look right i work for him all my life and make him rich and then he try to put me out even white folks dont get that low honey no i aint moving granny had wrapped up the childs head and given him some aspirin along with the admonition to be careful and stop causing grown folks trouble during their half hour the old man would tell frankie what a good job she had done that day he would go on about how smart she was going to be when she started schoolwhich would be in two years when the oldest boy was big enough to take care of the others she would sit straight up and her green eyes would glow at his praise and then she would join him in a well rehearsed exchange they were going to make a lot of moneyyes five hundred dollars and go far awayyes and buy a washing machine for mama and a big rocking chair for the old man yes yes after a while mattie would pick up the baby and go inside the others would follow and they would fall into the two beds which were stacked high with worn out mattresses and newspapers and blankets the next morning they would be up again at  the end of the year just before christmas they went to settle up they learned that they were  in the hole they owed mr white junior  on next years crop the old man didnt see how this could have happened yes he had borrowed money to eat and to pay three doctor bills but how could the figures have come out so badly against him yet there it was on paper what he owed and why the bossman offered to let him have some money for christmas but he refused he hated to get still deeper in debt he and mattie went home and told the children no christmas this year they would try to do better next year he was sad he had wanted terribly to buy a doll for frankie mae to give her something to play with during the snatches of time when she wasnt tending the children or doing chores he knew just the doll too a huge doll blond with smooth white skin it wore a blue satin dress and stood in front of the long white columns of a cardboard plantation big house he knew that frankie stood in front of this scene in the store window for hours whenever they went to town he would get it for her the next year    next year turned out to be the same only a few things were changed the debt was higher because the earlier  had to be added on to it now they owed  and mr white junior decided to take them off shares all the hands would work together in whatever field he chose he would pay  a day for chopping cotton and by the hundred pounds for picking the hands had no choice they could work by the day or leave actually it didnt make much difference they werent making any money on shares anyhow also the old man was made the timekeeper over the other workers that year as timekeeper the old man was given a large battered watch and told to see that the workers in the field made a full day if someone got sick and had to leave brown had to know because no one was paid for less than a day it was also his job to see that no one rested too long in the field they had to keep moving or go home and he had to see to it that all the weeds were kept out of the cotton the job was hard for him but he figured he treated the hands as well as anybody in his position could he had to see that the work was done and at the same time give the workers as much slack as he possibly could the worst part was in keeping after the women whose time was about to come he hated to see them drag themselves to the field their bellies almost bursting they were supposed to keep pace with the others which was impossible yet they had to work at it the best way they could and try to make it through the day because they had to make the  to pay esther the midwife the old man would feel a pain in his chest when mr white junior would slip up on them and find one of the big bellied women lagging behind the others the woman would be sent home walkingsometimes three or four miles depending on the field they were working mr white junior didnt carry hands home except to eat dinner and after the day had been made even if the woman had made six or seven hours she still had to go home without the   and brown would be cursed for not watching the hands more closely one day when he had carried the hands in from the field mr white junior stopped the old man as he was climbing down from the back of the pickup truck johnnie he said it dont look right to me for you to leave a girl at home that could be working when i need all the hands i can get this cotton cant wait on you all to get ready to chop it i want frankie mae out there tomorrow he had tried to resist but we getting along with what me and mattie makes aint got nothing but we eating i wants frankie mae to go to school we can do without the few dollars she would make mr white junior didnt bother to answer this he swung into his truck and started the motor framed by his shotgun which hung from a rack in the rear window he said get that girl down here tomorrow dont nobody stay in my house and dont work and he skidded off that night the old man dreaded the half hour on the porch when frankie had started school that year she had already been two years late and she had been so excited about going every night for months they talked about how much she was learning and all the nice people she metshe would probably make up those two years in no time they could double promote smart childrenprobably she would get a job as a schoolteacher when she finished and wear a white blouse every day when the wood had been gathered and the children cleaned up he followed frankie onto the sloping porch she started telling him about the magnificent yellow bus in which she rode to school he sat down next to her on the step frankie mae im got to tell you something whats that daddy mama say i been slow bout helping round the house since i been going to school i do better guess  lost my head over the schoolhouse no baby that aint it at all you been helping your mama fine he stood up to face her but could not bring his eyes to the level of her bright face mr white junior stopped me today when i was getting off the truck say he want you to come to field til the chopping get done she found his eyes oh and what did you say daddy well i told him how you wanted to go to school and we could do without your little money but he say you got to go the childs eyes lost their brilliance her shoulders slumped and she began to cry softly tired the old man sat back down on the step he took her hand and sat with her on the porch long after mattie and the children had gone to bed as he sat in the darkness he held tightly to the smooth little hand soon it would be hard and calloused the next morning frankie was up first she woke up her daddy and the others scolding them for being so slowthey had to go get all that cotton chopped no sense in wasting good daylight time in sleeping brown sat up in the bed he was already dressed since he had felt too tired to take off his clothes the night before he got up and threw some water on his face then he smiledthats how frankie mae was she would feel real bad terrible for a few hours but she always snapped back she would be all right now on the way to the field he said baby im gonna make you the watergirl all you got to do is carry water over to them that hollers for it and keep your bucket full you dont have to chop none lest you see mr white junior coming no daddy thats all right the other hands will say you was letting me off easy cause im yours say you taking advantage of being timekeeper ill go on and pick with the rest he tried to argue with her but she wouldnt let him give her the water bucket finally he put her next to mattie so she could learn from her as he watched over the field he forced himself not to think about his child inhaling the cotton dust and insecticide when his eyes happened on frankie mae and mattie their backs bent over he quickly averted them once when he jerked his eyes away he found instead the bright yellow school bus bouncing along the road frankie learned quickly how to chop the cotton and even seemed to find something about it to enjoy sometimes when they were working in a remote field the choppers would go at noon to the store for their dinner instead of going home they would buy sardines or canned sausages and crackers these they would have with pork and beans which they ate from jaggededged cans at the store the old man would watch with pride as frankie laughed and talked with everyone if there were hands from town she would make a point of going over and being friendly with them and she would make dates to attend church with the ladies at the different churches in town and on the other plantations every sunday frankie had a service to go to their own church met for service only once a month on the third sunday so on the other sundays she went visiting the old man went with her sometimes because he liked so much to see her enjoy herself that year they finished the chopping in june it was too late  to send frankie back to school and she couldnt go again until after the cotton had been picked when she went back to school in november she had missed four months and found it hard to keep up with the children who had been going all the time still she went every day that she could she stayed home only when she had to when her mother was sick or when in the cold weather she didnt have shoes to wear whenever she learned that she couldnt go to school on a particular day she would withdraw into herself for an hour or so and then she would smile and make the best of it by easter time she could write her name and read a little and add simple figures when company came the old man would call her to read them some passages from the family bible when it came time to chop the cotton again she had to stop school once more that was how the years went in the fall and spring brown carried her and the other children who were over eight years old to the field with him and in the winters he sent them to school as many days as he could some years frankie was promoted to the next grade and some years when she had missed five or six out of the nine school months she wasnt if it was possible the old man loved her still more now he saw the children of the other workers and his own children too get discouraged and stop going to school they said it was too confusing they never knew what the teacher was talking about because they had not been there the day before or the month before and they resented being left behind in classes with children half their size he saw the other children reach the point where they wouldnt hold themselves up wouldnt try to be clean and make folks respect them yet every other day his frankie mae managed to put on a clean starched dress and if she couldnt go to school that day she wore the dress for their half hour on the porch by the time frankie was  she could figure as well as the preacher and she was made secretary of the church that same year she asked her daddy if she could keep a record of what they spent during the year the old man was proud for her to do this he felt like something was wrong when each year he came out owing money but he didnt know how to do anything about it maybe this year with frankie to help him he could come out ahead he promised her that if it was possible any way this year he would buy her a sunday dress from the store in town it would be her first storebought dress he gave her all his receipts from the last seven years frankie bought a black and white speckled notebook she put in it what they made and what they paid on their bill after chopping time she became excited they had just about paid the bill out she and the old man would sit on the porch and go over the figures and plan what they would buy for christmas sometimes they even imagined that they would take a drive up to chicago to see uncle ed frankie told him that this year she would go to her first christmas dance at the schoolhouse in her new dress every so often he would try to hold down her excitement by reminding her that the figures would have to be checked against the bossmans figures but sne was so proud to be using what she had learned to help the family that he felt bad about saying things to discourage her just before christmas tne families on the place went to settle up for the year settling up meant finding out what they owed for the year before and borrowing as much as the man would let them have so that they could buy themselves some christmas when it came to the old mans turn he trembled a little it was almost too much to hope for that they would have money coming to them instead of owing it all the year he had kept from thinking about it too seriously except for m the times when frankie pulled him into her planning he motioned to frankie mae and went with her to the table where there were several stacks of five and ten dollar bills a big ledger and a pistol he took heart from the absolute confidence with which frankie mae walked next to him and controlled his tremblingmaybe the child was right and they had something coming to them hey there johnnie mr white junior said see you brought frankie mae along fine fine good to start them early here have a seat the old man gave frankie the one chair and stood besde her the bossman riffled his papers and came out with a long narrow sheet brown recognized his name at the top here you are johnnie yall come out pretty good this year proud of you dont owe but  since you done so good gonna let you have  for christmas frankie mae spoke up i been keeping a book for my daddy and i got some different figures let me show you there was a stillness in the room everyone while pretending not to notice the girl was listening intently to what she said mr white junior looked surprised but he recovered quickly why sure be glad to look at your figures you know its easy to make a mistake ill show you what you done wrong brown clutched her shoulder to stop her from handing over the  book but it was too late already she was leaning over the table comparing her figures with those in mr white juniors ledger see mr white junior when we was chopping last year we made  and you took  of that to put on our bill there there it is in your book and we borrowed  in july there it is    as she talked the other workers lifted and turned their heads until they were all looking straight at the black girl who was leaning over the table explaining to mr white junior that they had the same figures the man behind the table grew red one of his hands gripped the table while the other moved toward the pistol frankie mae finished so you see you owe us   for the year the bossman stood to gain the advantage of his height he seemed about to burst his eyes flashed wildly around the room and his hand clutched the pistol he was just raising it from the table when suddenly he caught hold of himself he took a deep breath and let go of the gun oh yeah i remember what happened now johnnie it was that slip i gave you to the doctor for willie b you remember last year before chopping time i got the bill last week it came to let me think yeah that was  the old mans tension fell away from him and he resumed his normal manner he knew exactly what the bossman was saying it was as he had expected as it had always been lets go baby he said but frankie didnt get up from the chair for a moment she looked puzzled then her face cleared she said but willie b didnt have anything wrong with him but a broken arm the doctor spent  minutes with him one time and  minutes the other that couldnt cost no  whites hand found the pistol again and gripped it until the knuckles were white the old man pulled frankie to him and put his arm around her with his free hand he fingered his own pistol which he always carried in his pocket he was not afraid but he hated the thought of shooting the man even if he just knicked him it would be the end for himself and who would take care of mattie and the children already he had done three years on the state farm he knew what it was like and he never wanted to go back there he drew a line for himself if mr white junior touched him or frankie he would shoot him short of that he would leave without a fight the bossman spat thick brown tobacco juice onto the floor spattering it on the old man and the girl nigger he said i know you aint disputing my word dont nobody live on my place and call me no liar that bill was  you understand me he stood tense staring with hatred at the man and the girl everyone waited for browns answer the old man felt frankies arms go round his waist tell him no daddy we right not him i kept them figures all year they got to be right the gates of the state farm flashed through the old mans mind he thought of mattie already sick from high blood trying to make a living for  people frankies arms tightened yessir he said i understand the girls arms dropped from him and she started to the door the other workers turned away to fiddle with a piece of rope or to scold a child brown accepted the  which was thrown across the  table to him as he turned to follow frankie he heard mr white juniors voice low now and with a controlled violence hey you girl frankie mae she stopped at the door know this white continued long as you live im gonna be right and you gonna be wrong now get your black ass outta here the child stumbled out to the car and crawled onto the back seat she cried all the way home brown tried to quiet herthey had done the best they could next year would be better she still could have the sunday dress the next morning he laid in bed waiting to hear frankie mae moving around and fussing that was how he knew each time that she had snapped back to her old self he laid there until everyone in the house had gotten up still he did not hear her finally he got up and went over to where she was balled up in the blankets he woke her she raised herself listlessly and went to throw some water on her face she didnt even bother to change the dress in which she had slept when the schoolbus came she said she had a stomach ache and wouldnt be going brown sat out on the porch all day long wishing that she would join him and struggling to understand what had happened this time frankie had not bounced back to her old brighteyed self the line which held her to this self had been stretched too taut it had lost its tension and had fallen slack at her side frankie never again kept a book for her daddy she lost interest in things such as numbers and reading she went to school as an escape from chores but got so little of her lessons done that she was never promoted from the fourth grade to the fifth when she was  and in the fourth grade she had her first child after that there was no more thought of school in the following four years she had three more children she sat around the house eating and growing fat when well enough she went to the field with her daddy it wasnt that she was  sullen or evil just disinterested in anything outside the tworoom shack her dresses were seldom ironed now whatever she could find to wear would do still there were a few times maybe once every two or three months when she was lively and fresh she would get dressed and clean the children up and have her daddy drive them to church on such days she would be the first one up she would have food on the stove before anybody else had a chance to dress it was for these isolated times that the old man waited they kept him believing that she would get to be all right until the day she died he woke up every morning listening for her laughter waiting for her to pull the covers from his feet and scold him for being lazy she died giving birth to her fifth child the midwife esther was good enough but she didnt know what to do when there were complications frankie mae bled to death on the hundred mile drive to the charity hospital in vicksburg      the old man squinted up at the fully risen sun the bossman was late he should have been at the gate by this time well it didnt matter just a few more minutes and they would be through with this place forever his thoughts went back again to the time when the civil_rights workers had first come around and they had started their meetings up at the store they had talked about voting and about how black people should have the same rights as whites and they had talked about how plantation workers should be making enough to live on brown and the other men had listened and talked and agreed so they decided to ask mr white junior for a raise thev would ask for the men to be paid  for their  hour work day well they had asked and he had said hell no before he would raise them he would lower them so they agreed to ask him again and if he still said no they would go on strike at first brown hadnt understood himself why he agreed to the strike it was only this morning that he realized why it was frankies wideeyed children there were two the two dark ones who moved around him with a terrible solemnity which seemed to continually rebuke him for the absence of their mother even during his scattered moments of gayety their green eyes followed him he couldnt send them the way frankie had gone not if he had a chance to do better and this strike was the chance he needed a cloud of dust rose up in front of brown the bossman was barrelling down the road in his pickup truck he was mad that was what he did when he got mad got in his truck and drove wildly up and down the road brown chuckled when they got through with him this morning he probably would run that truck into the river you see mr white junior didnt believe that they would quit him they had all left him at one time or another to try out some other plantation and all had come back some had gone and come back two or three times so he thought they were bluffing when they demanded the raise now he would find out differently he climbed down from the truck and mrde h s way over to the gate he began to give the orders for the day who would work in the shop what fields would be chopped what tractors would be used the men moved away from the fence disdaining any support for what they were about to do one of the younger men james lee spoke mr white junior we wants to know is you gonna raise us like we asked no goddammit now go on do what i told you then james lee continued we got to go on strike from this place james lee and the others began to leave the gate which had bound up the years of their lives ben handed mr white junior the keys to the shop and the old man handed him the scarred watch that had kept track of his peoples wastage of life and energy in the hot endless rows of cotton the watch that had ticked away frankie maes youth leaving her broken and dreamless at  i think it was the moment when the old man handed over the watch that for these men and their families the wheels of slavery ground to a halt
the south that shug remembers is one of morning dew  covered greenfields hookyday fishing on the tombigbee river and dollar cricket catchbut that is the south of a seven year old wagonbox happy rider it was a long time ago when shug was seven riding wagons catching crickets shug is riding south now passing dewcovered greenfields fhe is approaching the death of a father he has left something almost the same as a slow dying a daily struggle for survival and shug the rider knows that the father that he must see dying has been dead for a lifetime he died when he sent shug north to ghettoland at seven to become polluted and to fight a losing battle for survival now to fight forever the rider passes through green tree hamlets filled with greenfields and mossfilled shady lanes departing and approaching slow death far away he sees tree top landscaping and all the mossfilled trees on shady river banks look exactly as he remembers mossfilled trees twentyone years ago along the tombigbee river looking out the dark glass at the lonely telephone poles shug thinks of north    the winters    the winds    basement  a mother dying leaving him all alone    alone    it was lonely in ghettoland then    december bleak but no dying embers warmed shugs  year old body each gust of cold wind found its way into the dark hallway where he tried to sleep and with each gust of wind shug mumbled curses back at the dawn cursing did not stop the wind it had so many entrances it had a young boy homeless ragged that wind had shug captured jailed he could not blow his nose as he wanted because he was afraid he might wake the daynight sleepers within the house had him so that he could sleep only until he heard movements from the sleepers in the house or until the december dawn entered into daybreak the december wind bit and pricked shugs black body taking advantage of its opportunities cold frightened ragged praying for a father a remembered south without that which ones values depend not able to find it work for it shug was lost in north ghettoland could there be any warm and pretty places for him to sleep tomorrows or would he forever dream of other hallways in other tomorrows shug sat up rubbed his body and gymshoe covered feet trying to get circulation in frozen blackness listened  to the wind blow wanted to blow his nose could not felt the cold mucous running down and over his mouth wanted to sneeze wanted    wanted to remember what it was like to eat a warm breakfast wanted to remember the taste of grits and eggs    cooked food could not shug was in ghettoland and not a remembered dewcovered southland ma cold help me his mother could not hear him her struggle was over ma he said take my cricket money he wiped his nose the tears from his eyes man what you talking about crickets for a rat greygreen wet and cold too entered with the next gust of wind looked at shug shaking went up the stairs scratched at the door silence who entering from that outside world of white and light could help shug he rested his head against the wall of the hall teeth chattered rattled it was so cold so dark in that hallway its always so cold and dark shug was thinking it was cold and dark that morning when the city ambulance took his mother away that morning the wind and the ice became one and ghettoland rested cold silent as if deciding whether to eat its people for warmth and shug one of the people must be eaten by it or he must destroy it knowing this watching them take her away shug hoped that outside world would come although violence was around him he had never destroyed nature beyond the cricket not able to scream in rage shug could only pray frozen prayers to nature or destroy it that morning the wind and the snow as one whirled and twisted lodging itself here and there in the transparent dwellings through that land before entering shug and his mothers basement bottom dark it was away down there he moved around fumbling in darkness giving his mother the drugstore medicine the broth he vaguely re membered her making when he was sick with cold hearing her cough that faint cough she had suffered with for so long shug wondered when the other world of white and light omnipotence would come dark it was down there in that basement when his mother stopped coughing and so very dark it was when he watched them take her away from his young life that outside world of white and light did not come looking out of the glass door into dawn he saw the snow falling so white and beautiful that he wanted to enter it looked again at his gym shoes again out the glass door heard his empty stomach growl listened  to the wind blow damn man you need something to eat picked up his cardboard box with the odds planned to take them to the junkyard could use the box later after he sold the two pieces of iron to make a fire could warm his hands and feet shug cautiously went out into the pretty white snow where you go man where you get something to eat shug moved a little faster had read in a comic book how this guy lost in the cold forest kept warm by running through the alleys of that land searching through garbage cans for a morning breakfast somewhere shug found a biscuit somewhere he found an end piece of wonder bread sat in the snow eating the frozen food why you here man had been to the welfarehave your mother come in adc fathers name the people mister loan me fifty cent had been    what bright places could shug go tomorrow that were dark yesterdays    school look at shugs old clothes look at his

wagonbox and wheeeee down the hill home a whole dollar a hundred crickets      as the bus passed through jackson shug looked in the direction of the valley and his long ago home through the glass darkly seconds of wagonbox happiness he smiled the bus was soon leaving jackson crossing the tombigbee bridge moving swiftly down the dark highway it approached his father it departed that prison and shug the rider thought of yesterdays and tomorrowsdreams is them other lone riders lonely as me the greyhound bus slowed as it passed highway construction black prisoners in bright stripes labored with the red alabama earth singing in deep bass unison as guards kept rifles pointed some smiled and waved to the bus and even together each seemed alone had he appeared that way when he died at seven and again at  what kind of loneliness is this death will my daddy seem as he vaguely seemed yesterdays mobile alabama the driver said mobile in  minutes folks  shug searched the corridors of the
