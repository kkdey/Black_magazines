the black revolution is international
by rukudzo murapa
of us have  tended to equate slavr ery with the mass transportation of africans bqund in chains by heartless christian adventurers from their native homelands to far off sugar and cotton plantations in america to give slavery such a limited definition is to deny the historical facts of black experience on the african continent ever since the first christian slavehunting whiteman planted his foot on the west coast of africa if the system that brought the african to america was slave trade then the system that remained on the continent was slaveryonthespot they called it colonialism both systems as is well known were conducted and perpetuated by the same people both systems are filled with such incredible callousness that they sound like cruel fairy tales the two systems have a lot in commona thing most historians have left untold first they were both designed to benefit the west economically slave trade to america was not only a gigantic commercial operation involving well over  million lives but was a great help in financing both the english and french industrial revolutions as well as making possible the rise of the american plantation system colonialism on the other hand involved far more millions of lives provided the necessary raw material for the english and french industrial revolutions and helped finance the economic needs of the imperial powers in addtion to the small wars they fought among themselves as well as both world wars second both systems effectively excluded the blackman from participating in the formation of the political institutions that would control him even today some southern states of america still refuse to extend the rights to vote to the blacks there just as the preponderant majority of the blacks in rhodesia south africa mozambique angola and socalled portuguese guinea are denied the right to vote  third both systems were founded on the firm belief that the white race is endowed with superiority over the damned blacks this feeling of superiority led the white man to treat the blackman with a paternalistic attitude in both systems fourth both systems were marked with inhumane torture inflicted upon the blacks by the whites sir hans sloane in  reported that the slaves who committed major crimes were punished by nailing them down on the ground with crooked sticks on every limb and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands burning them gradually up to the head    for crimes of a lesser nature gelding or chopping off half of the foot with an axe    fifth the banner of christianity was held high in both systems before setting out on his voyages to hunt for slaves john hawkins always repeated his prayer serve god daily love one another preserve your victuals    as if this was not enough he christened one of his slave ships jesus on the other hand the colonist always reminded himself of his threepoint mission to christianize to civilize and to trade he even traded his christianity for the africans land a story is told of the white man who came to africa with a bible in his hand and found the african on his land upon meeting the african the whiteman asked the african to close his eyes and let  us pray by the time they said amen alas the african found the bible in his hand and his land was gone humourous as this may sound this is in fact what seems to have happened the list of similarities between the slave trade and colonialism can hardly be exhausted for the purpose of this paper however those that have been enumerated above will suffice the question to be asked is what kind of blackman emerged under each of the two systems we have already seen what happened to the african who was taken to america as a slave where he was turned into a negro by being stripped of his cultural identity the negrofied african american blackman lost the key to human dignity with human dignity lost no pride in the self was left consequently he did not only lose faith in himself and his fellowman but actually became ashamed of himself and worst of all hated himself because he hated himself he wanted to be like somebody else and the only somebody else there was to imitate was his master the white man the various shades of skin colorfrom the socalled highyellow to the quite black started distinguishing them intelligence no longer held the key to better opportunities but the shade of ones skin the lighter the skin the better the opportunities the white community employing the old machiavellian trick of divide and rule encouraged this to be lightskinned was not a source of shame for the extralegal integrationunderthe bedsheet activities between the black mother and the white master to be light was to be good to be acceptable to have a little dignitymaybe a little culture the nearer white one looked the better he felt is it any wonder therefore that the negrofied african wanted to make his hair look like the white mans he applied chemicals on his hair and burned it into a process or conk others chose to shave off all their hair or get the closest haircut possiblethey call it collegiate when i first came to this country i believed that all american black women grew straight hair naturally this belief stayed with me for four years until one rainy day a friend cancelled our dinner date with the excuse that the rain had turned her hair back   some women even chose to dye their hair blond i have heard them referred to as congolese blonds i call this search for identityphase  such are the manifestations of the shame afroamericans have been made to feel about themselves the manifestation of a crime worse than murderpsychic genocide if this is what happened to the black man brought to america what kind of an african emerged under the colonial system while the slavetrade completely m cut off the slave from his land thus denying him his culture onthespotslavery or colonialism allowed the colonist to decide which    land the african was to occupy and which belonged to him the colonist the land distribution laws which colonialism introduced in most countries demanded the removal of the african from the most fertile and productive areas to the least productive areas the land issue probably disturbed the africans way of life more than any other single issue besides the inequity in the land distribution itself there was a sharp philosophical conflict between the two groups as to the concept of land the western colonialist regarded land as a marketable commodity while the african regarded it as a godgiven right to be communally owned to the african land and life were inseparable land was the only visible and tangible basis for sustenance and subsistence thus losing land was tantamount to losing life itself yet like it or not the land is a marketable commodity philosophy had to prevailbut not without fierce armed resistance from the africans once the land was distributed the colonialists got the better and larger share in proportion to their numerical numbers in rhodesia for instance the whites who constitute seven percent of the population own more than  percent of the land the africans over  percent of the population are forced to live on about  percent of the landthis being die least fertile and poorly drained land once the land was taken the colonialists embarked upon the next stagethat of superimposing the european western cultures education and christianity were the two main channels used in imposing western culture on the african the education system was a direct carbon copy of that found in europe needless to say such a system was designed to deal with problems and further the interests of the imperial powers in biology the african had to learn herbs in england france portugal etc which are hardly relevant to his immediate environment this was true of other subjects today one will notice that the socalled educated african knows more about the history of europe than his own he can recite the stories of william and mary charles i and ii raleigh the mayflower napoleon the seven years war joan of arc the crusades etc with such accuracy it appears as if he were there ask him about his own history about the kingdoms of ghana songhai mali congo or zimbabwe and he will look at you as if you were crazy and if he knows anything about african history it  is usually history in the version of the white colonialist just as the slave in america was made to be ashamed of his own history so was the african made to look negatively at his own past if education made the african direct his mind to europe christianity made him give up his whole selfthat is his customs values and religious beliefs christianity probably inflicted more harm on african culture than education as it involved more people while in most cases one had to be a christian in order to get an education since most of the schools were run by missionaries one did not have to be educated in order to be a christian the christian missionaries did not have the ability to separate the christian religion from western culture if indeed that is possible in the eyes of the missionaries everything african was pagan demonic or heathen to the missionary the african drum was filled with evil spirits so were the people who danced to the tunes african ways of worship said the missionary were pagan since the missionary could not understand it to him the african was worshiping his ancestors not knowing that he was worshiping through his ancestors to a higher being just as the missionary worshiped to god through jesus or the mohammedans through muhammed to allah without taking time to study and understand the african culture the missionary felt his divine mission was to wipe out the african way of life with the same conviction and vigor his brethren had fought the crusade wars thus once the african was enjoined to the christian family through the baptism ritual in the name of the father son and the holy spirit he had to change his whole way of life like the slave in america he had to change his name to a western name for the westerner this was civilization the average african believed it with education and christianity combining their forces to make a new african the end result was the emergence of a britishafrican frenchafrican portugueseafrican etc yet somehow there still remained an africanafrican the westernized african did not sever his native cultural ties completely this is virtually impossible for anybody to do just as the american black man became disillusioned when he found that he wasnt completely accepted by the white community no matter how american he felt the educated andor christianized african soon realized that the white communityincluding many if not most missionariesdid not accept him as an equal this led him to demand complete control of his own life to do this he had to control all those institutionspolitical economic social and cultural that affected his life and the lives of his people the inherent contradictions within the systems once they manifested themselves became dysfunctional to the system the rise of nationalism and the demand for political independence was a direct result of the disillusionment once disillusioned the african sought to give himself a definition of his own similar to the identity sought by the american blackman this second identity for the american blackman is in actuality a denial or a rebuff of the first while the search for identity phase i caused the negrofied african to be ashamed of himself physically and spiritually search for identity phase  leads him not only to accept what he is but to be proud of it it is a search for soul it is what i call the denegrofication of the black man in america it is a sincere attempt to search for and develop cultural identity with the old country more and more american black men refuse to be referred to as negroes instead they choose to be called either blacks or afroamericans in other words as human beings they are africans cognizant and conscious of our common cultural heritage    among the peoples of african origin throughout the world and are desirous of reviving and extending a dynamic interest in this heritage

ne assumption about the blackman in the united states that no one seems to question is that he was completely cut off from africa and so is totally a product of european civilization that he is a black european as recently as the summer of  i still believed this and wrote the negro was so completely cut loose from africa that next to nothing is left of it in his culture he is more completely american than anyone in this country not because as some say he has been here so long but because the american culture is the only culture he knows this was so i believed because i had been taught as have we all that the only way for a civilization to preserve itself is in books in terms of a written language the european in europe and the united states is always using the phrase since the beginning of recorded time he assumes that no one knows anything about what happened before that beginning and that the only way man can find  out about before the beginning is to dig up something somewhere once anyone black or white accepts that principle the rest follows like grease when the european went into africa he didnt find any written language so immediately he assumed that african civilization was a stupid a primitive a subhuman civilization later after darwins theory of evolution he amended the wording slightly now we represented a lower stage of development but he meant the same thing primitive stupid and subhuman and all because we didnt have written languages but to decide that a civilization is subhuman because it has no written language is as silly as saying that one man is more subhuman than another simply because he cant write his name by the same principle within the ranks of the literate human distinctions would correspond to the quality of a mans handwriting the man who cannot write lives life as talkerlistener he may be missing something but we cant say that his life his experience is less human less valid than that of a man who can write his name quite simply he lives a different kind of life his experience is different and since experience moulds personality and culture two sets of experiences will mould different men and cultures after the european discovered africa decided to conquer it and did militarily at least he realized that he had conquered a different kind of man but then something and the european will have to figure out why and what snapped and instead of saying i am different from you and starting from there he said we are the same but i am better that was the end for him we were the same but lower he convinced himself that he had experienced in his own cultural past the same things that we were experiencing in his present he assumed that he knew us so we learned nothing about us instead of searching for the terms in which we defined ourselves he defined us in terms of himself and what he had he had a written language we did not we were subhuman if the european had looked for what we did have he would have discovered that instead of written languages and written traditions we had very complex oral languages and oral traditions for example the sentence a woman sitting on a bed sewing is crying in the ibo language of west africa becomes nwanyi no nenu akwa nakwa akwa nakwa akwa the ibo language is a tone language to make this clear suppose there are seven tones in speaking which correspond to seven notes in the key of c c through b if you sang nakwa to the notes eb it might mean sitting if you sang it to the notes fd it might mean crying add to this the possibilities o mood accents context rhythm and we have what the european calls a primitive language no wonder we didnt write them down it would take more than letters placed side by side to get the ibo language on paper in fact african writers trying to write in their own language are having just this problem they are working with tonic alphabets our oral tradition was as complex and sophisticated as our languages when the european was tucked away silently reading books which a person can only do alone africans were out in the world among all kinds of people talking to them learning from them arguing with them doing business with them talking women were passing cultural traditions in the stories they told their children men who healed the sick were instructing younger men artists were being trained in their cultures artistic principles knowledge of the past of the environment was being passed around not just within a lifetime but from one lifetime to the next spanning centuries and oceans on the boats which brought us to the united states we talked do you doubt it we did not waste time worrying about not possessing a written culture for the european not to bring we talked about where each of us had come from the beliefs and myths of that place the places each of us had been what he had done there we talked about our present situation and our probable future we did not sit in our chains silently we whispered do you doubt it an ibo and an ashanti chained together found a way to talk we created languages suited to our primary need survival gullah is an example of such a language in the united states bubba meaning brother is a gullah word cooler means turtle goober means peanut our oral tradition remained alive and with it africa in the united states it was not the africa of whofoughtwhoforwhat strange that the history of europe and the united states is the history of wars or exactly where we had come from or the exact languages we had spoken not history culture civilization as the european   defines them it was instead the africa say of the kitchen an african woman may have cooked unseasoned meat and bland potatoes for her master but when she got some scraps from his table and took them back to her cabin she cooked the food she wanted to eat african with spice and pepper and she taught her daughter african cooking using what they had and her daughter taught her daughter and that daughter cooks african food in a little diner in the middle of harlem today i have eaten proof of what i say in many an african students hotel room tender pepperhot meat onions greens and the rice the rice    or dont take the cooking take the christianity of the blackman in the united states the european thinks that we believe in his religion he thinks that we believe in his god and his gods son but the evidence shows that we believe in our god our god likes some good music in his church he likes some people to go into trance and talk tongues different people different gods and if our concept of god is different from the europeans the difference must originate in africa where else and our music wherever africans survived in what the european likes to call the new world despite the redman having been on the continent for at least  years we find our music in jamaica it is called calypso in cuba guaguanco in brazil samba in the united states jazz terrible word and when we in the united states hear calypso guaguanco or samba dont we know it is our music we dance to all of it our music is perhaps the best example of how the oral tradition preserved africa in the united states any black musician ive ever met or heard about has emphasized personal contact oral contact musical contact with another musician as an important aspect of his musical development clifford brown played with max roach who played with dizzy who played with roy eldridge    louis armstrong played with king oliver who played with buddy bolden who played with a blackman who played with a blackman who played with a musician who before his abrupt arrival in the united states had played on some trumpetlike instrument in ashantiland the european in the united states tells us that our music is american have we ever believed that has any european been an innovator or practitioner of our music on an equal level with james brown duke ellington thelonious monk coleman hawkins lester young charlie parker leadbelly or sonny rollins and others this is not because of any inherent weakness in the european in the united sates he is simply not in the african oral mainstream he does not get the right information it did not have to be that way elsewhere in the hemisphere we can see that african and european have mixed culturally racially that africa has spread to a great many people but in those other places the nature of the oppression was different from that which we faced because the europeans practicing it were different than our european historians have shown the difference between catholic and protestant slavery or french and  spanish slavery or both of these and english slavery what our european did was to segregate us from himself and at the same time lump us together he really should have kept our tribes apart chained ibo to ibo promoted tribal animosity within the united states as he does today  in africa encouraged each tribe to compete for his favor but instead seeing us all as subhuman as inferior he did not bother to distinguish between us and so lumped us together giving us at least one common experience and enemy then he pushed us away he erected a social institution which would save him from contamination so doing he robbed himself of african civilization not to say that he didnt steal parts of it without really understanding it james brown is not elvis presley the five stair steps are not the beatles and he created a situation in which he would not contaminate us now we begin to see our true situation in the united states because african civilization was an oral rather than a written civilization each adult african who arrived in the united states possessed an enormous body of knowledge about himself his history traditions and customs knowledge which could not be destroyed as long as he lived and talked each african sifted through his experience his knowledge trying to find  something to help him survive in his new environment and he was talking he asked other africans other slaves sons of africans picking up different kinds of knowledge sharing experience finally the tribes the cultures the newcomers and oldtimers mixed and what has emerged is not a culture with nothing of africa in it but rather a panafrican culture but the europeans did not see this he saw instead a universe with himself at the center a few steps down the ladder from his god he had a written language he had machines he owned things like guns people and books which told him that his culture his civilization was the greatest most advanced that the world had ever known until the th century his maps told him that the world was flat his philosophers told him that if a man made money it was evidence that god had blessed him with a soul that was predestined to go to heaven we couldnt read or writebut we knew where china was chinese plates have been found in the congo dating from before marco polo a boatload of chinese arrived on the shores of what is now kenya ages before the european moslems in the camerouns and nigeria knew where mecca was egypt knew where israel was ghanaians may have known the incas and where california now is some africans knew where  rome was their pictures are in the mosaic tile bathrooms at pompeii but the european looked at us and saw cheap labor cotton tobacco money heaven a black cain killing a white abel and being driven from the garden of eden or later as a lower level on the evolutionary scale    fish amphibian reptile mammal ape nigger man european civilization we did not possess a written language because we hadnt evolved to it yet we had no books and couldnt remember anything but even in the united states away from that place the european was certain we had forgotten and locked away from his library a group of africans finished working played some drums told innocent stories about weak rabbits big dumb bears crafty foxes sang songs danced talked    and everywhere the european sees evidence of africa in the united states youre damn right hes scared brother 
the eloquent legacy of a doomed african freedom fighter

 lord we find ourj h  selves here in a foreign  ml £ country convicted ungj der laws made by people whom we have always considered as foreigners we find ourselves tried by a judge who is not our countryman and who has not shared our background aer iaws maae °y peo when this case started counsel tried to show that this court had no jurisdiction to try us what they had to say was of a technical and legal nature the reasons may mean little to some of us but it is the deep feeling of all of us that we should not be tried here in pretoria you my lord decided that you had the right to try us because your parliament gave you that right that ruling has not and could not have changed our feelings we are namibians and not south africans we do not now and will not in the future recognize your right to govern us to make laws for us in which we had no say to treat our country as if it were your property and us as if you were our masters we have always regarded south africa as an intruder in our country this is how we have always felt and this is how we feel now and it is on this basis that we have faced this trial i speak of we because i am trying to speak not only for myself but for others as well and especially for those of my fellow accused who have not had the benefit of any education i think also that when i say we the overwhelming majority of nonwhite people in south west africa would like to be included we are far away from our homes not a single member of our families has come to visit us never mind be present at our trial the pretoria jail the police headquarters at compol where we were interrogated and where statements were extracted from us and this court is all we have seen of pretoria we have been cut off from our people and the world we all wondered whether the headmen would have repeated some of their lies if our people had been present in court to hear them the south african government has again shown its strength by detaining us for as long as it pleased keeping some of us in solitary confinement for  to  days and bringing us to its capital to try us it has shown its strength by passing an act especially for us and having it made retrospective ihas even chosen an ugly name to call us by ones own are called patriots or at least rebels your opponents are called terrorists a court can only do justice in political cases if it understands the position of those that it has in front of it the state has not only wanted to convict us but also to justify the policy of the south african government we will not even try to present the other side of the picture because we know that a court has not suffered in the same way as we have can not understand us this is perhaps why it is said that one should be tried by ones equals we have felt from the very time of our arrest that we were not being    i    tried by our equals but by our masters and that those who have brought us to trial very often do not even do us the courtesy of calling us by our surnames had we been tried by our equals it would not have been necessary to have any discussion about grievances they would have been known to those set to judge us it suits the government of south africa to say that it is ruling south west africa with the consent of the people this is not true our organization south west african peoples organization swapo is the largest political organization in south west africa we consider ourselves a political party we know that whites do not think of blacks as politiciansonly as agitators many of our people through no fault qf their own have had no education at all this does not mean that they do not know what they want a man does not have to be formally educated to know that he wants to live with his family where he wants to live and not where an official chooses to tell him to live to move about freely and not require a pass to earn a decent wage to be free to work for the person of his choice for as long as he wants and finally to be ruled by the people that he wants to be ruled by and not those who rule him because they have more guns than he has our grievances are called socalled grievances we do not believe south africa is in south west africa in order to provide facilities and work for nonwhites it is there for its own selfish reasons for the first  years it did practically nothing to fulfill its sacred trust it only concerned itself with the welfare of the whites since  because of the pressure from inside by the nonwhites and especially my organization and because of the limelight placed on our country by the world south africa has been trying to do a bit more it rushed the bantustan report so that it would at least have something to say at the world court only one who is not white and has suffered the way we have can say whether our grievances are real or socalled those of us who have some education together with our uneducated brethren have always struggled to get freedom the idea of our freedom is not liked by south africa it has tried in this court to prove through the mouths of a couple of its paid chiefs and a paid official that swapo does not represent the people of south west africa if the government of south africa were sure that swapo did not represent the innermost feelings of the people in south west africa it would not have taken the trouble to make it impossible for swapo to advocate its peaceful policy south african officials want to believe that swapo is an irresponsible organization and that it is an organization that resorts to the level of telling people not to get vaccinated as much as white south africans may want to believe this this is not swapo we sometimes feel that is what the government would like swapo to be it may be true that some member or even members of swapo somewhere refused to do this the reason for such refusal is that some people in our part of the world have lost confidence in the governors of our country and they are not prepared to accept even the good that they are trying to do your government my lord undertook a very special responsibility when it was awarded the mandate over us after the first world war it assumed a sacred trust to guide us toward independence and to prepare us to take our place among the nations of the world we believe that south africa has abused that trust because of its belief in racial supremacy that white people have been chosen by god to rule the world and apartheid we believe that for  years south africa has failed to promote the development of our people where are our trained men the wealth of our country has been used to train your people for leadership and the sacred duty of preparing the indigenous people to take their place among the nations of the world has been ignored i know of no case in the last  years of a parent who did not want his child to go to school if the facilities were available but even if as it was said a small percentage of parents wanted their children to look after cattle i am sure that south africa was strong enough to impose its will on this as it has done in so many other respects to us it has always seemed that our rulers wanted to keep us backward for their benefit nineteen sixtythree for us was to be the year of our freedom from  it looked as if south africa could not oppose the world forever the world is important to us in the same way as all laughed in court when they heard that an old man tried to bring down a helicopter with a bow and arrow we laughed when south africa said that it would oppose the world we knew that the world was divided but as time went on it at least agreed that south africa had no right to rule us i do not claim that it is easy for men of different races to live at peace with one another i myself had no experience of this in my youth and at first it surprised me that men of different races could live together in peace but now i know it to be true and to be something for which we must strive the south african government creates hostility by separating people and emphasizing their differences we believe that by living together people will learn to lose their fear of each other we also believe that this fear which some of the whites have of africans is based on their desire to be superior and privileged and that when whites see themselves as part of south west africa sharing with us all its hopes and troubles then that fear will disappear separation is said to be a natural process but why then is it imposed by force and why then is it that whites have the superiority headmen are used to oppress us this is not the first time that foreigners have tried to rule indirectlywe know that only those who are prepared to do what their masters tell them become headmen most of those who had some feeling for their people and who wanted independence have been intimidated into accepting the policy from above their guns and sticks are used to make people say they support them i have come to know that our people cannot expect progress as a gift from anyone be it the united nations or south africa progress is something we shall have to struggle and work for and i believe that the only way in which we shall be able and fit to secure that progress is to learn from our own experience and mistakes your lordship emphasized in your judgment the fact that our arms come from communist countries and also that words commonly used by communists were to be found in our documents but my lord in the documents produced by the state there is another type of language it appears even more often than the former many documents finish up with an appeal to the almighty to guide us in our struggle for freedom it is the wish  of the south african government that we should be discredited in the western world this is why it calls our struggle a communist plot but this will not be believed by the world the world knows that we are not interested in ideologies we feel that the world as a whole has a special responsibility towards us this is because the land of our fathers was handed over to south africa by a world body it is a divided world but it is a matter of hope for us that it at least agrees about one thingthat we are entitled to freedom and justice other mandated territories have received their freedom the judgment of the world court was a bitter disappointment to us we felt betrayed and we believed that south africa would never fulfill its trust some felt that we would secure our freedom only by fighting for it we knew that the power of south africa is overwhelming but we also knew that our cause is a just one and our situation intolerablewhy should we not also receive our freedom we are sure that the worlds efforts to help us in our plight will continue whatever south africans may call us we do not expect that independence will end our troubles but we do believe that our people are entitledas are all peoplesto rule themselves it is not really a question of whether south africa treats us well or badly but that south west africa is our country and we wish to be our own masters there are some who will say that they are sympathetic with our cause but unwilling to condone violence i would answer that i am not by nature a man of violence and i believe that violence is a sin against god and my fellow man swapo itself was a nonviolent organization but the south african government is not truly interested in whether opposition is violent or nonviolent it does not wish to hear any opposition to apartheid since  swapo meetings have been banned it is true that it is the tribal authorities who have done so but they worked with the south african government which has never lifted a finger in favor of political freedom we have found ourselves voteless in our own country and deprived of the right to meet and state our own political opinions is it surprising that in such times my countrymen have taken up arms violence is truly fearsome but who would not defend his property and himself against a robber and we believe that south africa has robbed us of our country i have spent my life working in swapo which is an ordinary political party like any other suddenly we in swapo found that a war situation had arisen and that our colleagues and south africa were facing each other in the field of battle although i had not been responsible for organizing my people militarily and although i believed we were unwise to fight the might of south africa while we were so weak i could not refuse to help them when the time came my lord you found it necessary to brand me a coward during the second world war when it became evident that both my country and your country were threatened by the dark clouds of nazism i risked my life for both of them wearing a uniform with orange bands on it but some of your countrymen when called to battle to defend civilization resorted to sabotage against their own fatherland i volunteered to face german bullets and as a guard of military installations both in south west africa and the republic was prepared to be the victim of their sabotage today they are our masters and are considered the heroes and i am called the coward  when i consider my country i am proud that my countrymen have taken up arms for their people and i believe that anyone who calls himself a man would not despise them in  the african national congress anc and pan africanist congress pac in south africa were suppressed this convinced me that we were too weak to face south africas force by waging battle when some of my countrys soldiers came back i foresaw the trouble there would be for swapo my people and me personally i tried to do what i could to prevent my people from going into the bush in my attempts i became unpopular with some of my people but this too i was prepared to face decisions of this kind are not easy to make my loyalty is to my country my organization could not work properly it could not even hold meetings i had no answer to the question where has your nonviolence got us whilst the world court judgment was pending i at least had that to fall back on when we failed after years of waiting i had no answer to give to my people even though i did not agree that people should go into the bush i could not refuse to help them when i knew that they were hungry i even passed on the request for dynamite it was not an easy decision another man might have been able to say i will have nothing to do with that sort of thing i was not and i could not remain a spectator in the struggle of my people for their freedom i am a loyal namibian and i could not betray my people to their enemies i admit that i decided to assist those who had taken up arms i know that the struggle will be long and bitter i also know that my people will wage that struggle whatever the cost only when we are granted our independence will the struggle stop only when our human dignity is restored to us as equals of the whites will there be peace between us we believe that south africa has a choiceeither to live at peace with us or to subdue us for force if you choose to crush us and impose your will on us then you not only betray your trust but you will live in security for only so long as your power is greater than ours no south african will live at peace in south west africa for each will know his security is based on force and that without force he will face rejection by the people of south west africa my coaccused and i have suffered we are not looking forward to our imprisonment we do not however feel that our efforts and sacrifice have been wasted we believe that human suffering has its effect even on those who impose it we hope that what has happened will persuade the whites of south africa that we and the world may be right and they may be wrong only when white south africans realize this and act on it will it be possible for us to stop our struggle for freedom and justice in the land of our birth editors note the statement on the previous pages was taken from the congressional record where it was published at the behest of representative barrett ohara of illinois the following paragraphs prefaced mr toivos statement in the record representative barrett ohara of illinois asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this point in the congressional record and to include extraneous matter mr ohara of illinois mr speaker we who are so fortunate as to live in a land where our legal rights and civil liberties are protected and cherished sometimes need reminding of our blessings we who enjoy freedom of speech and representative government may forget that there are people elsewhere in the world less fortunate often they are forced to suffer in silence but occasionally the veil is lifted a trifle and a voice is heard crying out for help for the afflicted this happened recently in pretoria where  southwest africans have been charged by south africa under an act so unjust that it offends accepted civilized legal principles and grossly violates the universal declaration of human rights one of the defendants mr toivo herman ja toivo after being pronounced guilty addressed the court in mitigation of sentence he made such an eloquent statement that i am placing it in the record it captures the essence of his plight a plight which this government has repeatedly protested his is the plea of a people struggling to be free unfortunately his plea so far has had little effect on the south african government on february  the judge sentenced mr toiva to  years in jail and  others to life imprisonment we can only hope that the censure of world opinion might yet persuade the government of south africa in the direction of clemency

must be deniggerfied demystified images to shape us black as men values but we must clearly understand that the questions of identity and nationalism are even at their utmost best a means not an end a good beginning in order for racial dominajwj j m tion to be successful the racist oppressor had to create in us selfdoubt and feelings of insecurity finally selfdespise when we understand this contradiction we will be better able to understand why the liberation struggle in africa mobilizes the people by awakening nationalist passions and why afroamericans rally around identity in colonial africa the peoples identity has remained relatively intact because the oppressor never pretended to assimilate us he attempted to crush our pride as african nationals he made us feel inadequate and weak as africans so it is as africans with a rediscovered pride after rejecting the distorted image of ourselves which colonial institutions had programmed us into that we begin our fight for liberation in america however particularly in the north the peoples identity is continually being damaged by the oppressors use of hypocritical rhetoric and bogus legislationbales of rosetinted cotton over the eyes of gullible subjects the vocabulary of the black mans experience in america is contaminated with terms like integration meltingpot society civil_rights which are nothing but ways of destroying the black victims identity to ensure his psychological captivity and his alienation from himself thus it is that the question of identity among afroamericans is of primary importance as a first step towards liberatory struggle identity and nationalism then are simply strategic points of reference in our struggle for liberation the world is on fire and we do not want to be scorched with the evil maniacs who throw napalm bombs on innocent children and unless values move us we deserve worse than death how does a thing mean if it doesnt move i know numerous south africans believe me who run around the world searching for a good white man in a desperate attempt to stop themselves from coming to grips with the only rational conditions under which we have to get our land back invariably though this captive searches between white thighs and finds the dollar or whatever currency extremely irresisti ble to say i have had enough of this be the this the most hideous kind of oppression and not do anything about itand not movedoes not amount to anv  w thing we must move to create in concrete ways images of a livable world centuries of colonial domination moved and with them the oppressors chains from our wrists and ankles to our minds and soul raped but the slime remains invisible to the victims eye let us be sensitive to what is around us what we are into the selfavowed nationalist in black communities in the northern sectors of the united states reacting to the white oppressor calls me an african brother if african brother was strictly descriptive of place of birth there would be nothing to be worried about but there is this attitude behind african brother i am a brother however i am still a foreigner an outsider again a subconscious acceptance of the psychological boundaries created by the oppressor but in a black community in the south say in alabama i am not any more of a foreigner than my brother from harlem after the initial excitement over my being african i am simply another black man from another community and the alabama brother or sister might never have heard of nationalism or revolution divide and rulelets get to it the african on the other hand in most cases he is a student here comes on like some missionary afraid of the savagery of the natives often paternalistic and contemptuous in his dealings with afroamericans he is afraid to go up to harlem because these negroes are so rough and negroes are ashamed of us anyway they say we come from the jungle and    i even know of an african statesman who told students from his country that if they married in america please do not take a nigger home if anything better look for a nice white girl raped but the slime remains invisible to the victims eye the white oppressor tells us that we do not like each other that we do not have anything in common and we accept the nonsense and affirm it without even realizing that we have been put in a trick because we do not look beyond the superficial appearance i concede that the relations between the african and other people of african descent are not what they could and should be we must not pretend that this does not exist because that way we could not possibly cure the sickness we must see the trick bag and understand why the oppressor found it necessary to put us in it then together we must let it go up in flames scorching to death the veiled oppressor hand twisting us around like puppets we have to start with a total rejection of the oppressor and his ways there is a tendency among us when we become disillusioned with the oppressors rhetoric the whiteman is not man enough to fulfill his promises we eventually realize to reject the oppressor and replace our former naive faith in his word with unguided hatred this rejection however has often turned out to be the most complete kind of acceptance of the oppressor because this disillusioned man often ends up assuming the role of the oppressor twisted and lacking in commitment to the people he does not even realize that his overt hatred is finally a manifestation of his envy for the oppressors bloodstained acquisitions there is the angry black artist who devotes his efforts to telling white people how immoral and inhuman they are because they do not love him and he has contempt for his people because they are ignorant and poorbut he does nothing to enlighten them there is the ambitious businessman who is against white businesses in black communities but as a superprofit motivated businessman he exploits his people as readily and as much as his white rival would and does there is the civil servant of the newly independent nation who is fascinated i believe by the glamour of his new position which used to be exclusively for the oppressor his concept of social change goes no farther than that there are black faces in the cabinet instead of white ones everything else remains as it was during the colonial period and the chains wax tighter around the mind heralding a coup a nephew of a prominent african political figure invited lindsay barrett the writer and i to dinner one day he would clap his hands for service and an elderly man old enough to be his grandfather whom he couldnt summon enough courage to look in the face would come in from the kitchen to see what master wanted this threatened my appetite and i asked our host to stop his performance there are probably a lot of things you do not like about the situation in our country he said as we got ready to leave but please dont write anything bad about it if you will still be writing in another ten years there will be some changes and you will have plenty of good things to write about i just shook my head in frustrated condemnation of the mentality of our bourgeoisie yesterdays victim turns villain today with comfort at our expense by this simply to point out that exploitation by a black capitalist elite is not less hideous than exploitation by a white racist oppressor after the bloodshed after the coups and countercoups inevitably builtin in almost every struggle against the oppressor after the oppressor is forced to hand over the  government to the fighting colonial subject after the national independence celebrations and even babies learn to speak by singing the new national anthem we shall still be quite a long way from freedom because freedom is not an experience nor is freedom the physical absence of the white oppressor freedom is an attitude a complex of emotional and psychological responsesconscious and subconscioustowards life shaped and determined by the values a people lives by in harmony with other peoples and nature freedom and with it liberation is socialistic in nature socialistic because the purposeaim is the greatest good for the greatest number not as unattainable ideal but as an actual mode of living panafricanism or african unity seems today in  to be more removed from our reach than it was in  why i suggest that our lack of a clear understanding of our contradictions led to this we relied upon the influence of external forces for our unity black people suffered under white oppression and it was on opposition to white oppression that we based our unity after political independence and the oppressor was no longer thereby this to mean no more than white faces in administrative and civil service jobs were replaced by black onesapparently we were left without a great need for unity our unity should be something we desire something we fashion regardless of the presence or absence of the oppressor our unity should be based upon positive attitudes towards our future something to be proud of our unity should be a positive act by us and for us instead of a mere protest or reaction against white domination its common factor more noble than oppression to speak of a movement towards freedom and unity without a clear understanding of our goals could not possibly change our condition significantly and the africanity of the oau organization of african unity is still very questionableask brother julius nyerere selfreliance selfdetermination destination and road woven inseparably every inch of the way and when we fail and fall into the claws of neocolonialism the fault is with us the road to liberation starts with resolving our national contradictions mwalimu nyerere is a committed teacher we have a great deal to learn from him he teaches us that our basic requirements are hard work and intelligence he teaches us that we cannot depend upon gifts loans and investments from foreign countries and foreign companies because there is no way of doing that without endangering our independence let us therefore always remember the following he says in the arusha declaration we have made a mistake to choose money something which we do not have to be our major instrument of development we are mistaken when we imagine that we shall get money from foreign countries firstly because to say the truth we cannot get enough money for our development and secondly because even if we could get it such complete dependence on outside help would have endangered our independence and the other policies of our country    the development of a country is brought about by people not by money money and the wealth it represents is the result and not the basis of development  in order to maintain our independence and our peoples freedom we ought to be selfreliant in every possible way and avoid depending upon other countries for assistance if every individual is selfreliant the house cell will be selfreliant if all the cells are selfreliant the whole ward will be selfreliant and if the wards are selfreliant the district will be selfreliant if the districts are selfreliant then the region is selfreliant and if the regions are selfreliant then the whole nation is self   reliant and this is our aim    demystified indeed in deed then we must build and be productive for our salvation we rhave to build attitudes we have to build men and women fearless souls we have to build model famm ilies to build model communities to produce societies with values fashioning a life worth living we have to build our own economies inde pendent of whatever hideous devil is threatened by our attitudes and ways there will be some movement then and we will be rebuilding every individual man in our communities wherever he is never insensitive to his roots replenishing our collective energy and resources our lives then rhythm of a purposeful direction all things falling into place natural and desirable freedom is an attitude our values clearly patterning our actions and reactions the most valid song of our life unity and selfreliance the national anthem sung by the way we live wherever we live knowing no rest until our life flows like a poem loving the lovable we must create more of it destroying the detestable knowing what we be

here is the possibility t that you are living more precariously than you know consider    largely unreported by most newspaper accounts of miss eartha kitts controversial white house encounter was her alleged avowal that she spoke    not as a negro but as an american you see during a writers conference a black student in a black sociology class at a black college wailed passionately i think of myself as a citizen of one worldnot a negro an yearold high school dropout stood with me in the pathetically bare confines of a recreation room in the heart of a ghetto the tiny area empty except for a battered piano and some equally battered wooden folding chairs had been provided by a poverty action program in weak hope that it would serve to subvert adolescent leanings toward violence he was a reluctant and somewhat suspiciousminded conversationalist riot not him he wasnt liable to get hisself shot at or his head beat in okay now tell me this if you needed socks where would you buy them the project shopping center housed  variety storesone blackowned one whiteowned at the first one i got to probably the white one why oohhhhi dont have no prejudice there are more gems the wounded black serviceman on  day leave from vietnam who castigated me when i mentioned having participated in peace demonstrations he lectured on the dangers of communism and i incredulous could not get in a word about the various virulent forms of american fascism wallaceism reaganism welchism et al there was the black civic leader whitesubsidized and nationally acclaimed for her block clubs and nobeerdrinkinginpublic policies who said on a local tvcast  if you can teach them and you know who them is to be good citizens all else will follow chuckling dont if there are  million of us i lay you odds give or take a few hundred thousand that  million of us stand with proudly palpitating hearts and add our rich natural rhythms to the star spangled banner proudly proclaiming for whiteys approval i am an american first and a negro second this is in the category of the jews classic we are germans first and jews later many of those good white lawabiding german citizens were still singing this refrain halfway to belsen and dachau and they learned the answer to the ancient riddle paraphrased of which came firstgerman citizenship or jewishnessin the shower rooms of auschwitz and treblinka you are a black person first baby and youd better remember it consider the unique position of the jews in prenazi europe families such as the rothschilds weinmanns the petscheks controlled vast properties and were deeply involved in international finance jews owned steel corporations coal mines textile mills they had extensive real estate holdings they owned banks chemical firms and big business establishments as well as a plethora of small enterprises in fact  years ago jewish money formed if not the backbone of the economic structure of europe a significant portion of its strength if that were not enough the jews had a racial bank of academic scientific technical and professional skills which may have surpassed any accumulation we as a race presently possess in poland they were the intelligentsia who even in the squalid ghettos to which they were driven maintained a cultural existence just prior to the nazi occupation there were  jewish daily newspapers  jewish weeklies and a total of  jewish periodicals in poland alone and one survivors account of the vilna poland ghetto mentions the activities of a symphony two choirs and a literary group which held a series of  literary evenings and organized literary competitions they were an incredible people these jews their contributions to their society cannot be argued add then the factor which should have insured their assimilation and more or less assured their acceptance as firstclass citizens in a white majority culture they were whiteskinned many millions of them could and on the face of it did disappear within the structure of german societyleaving only a ripple to mark the spot where they m discarded their jewishness for the greater glory of assimilation the people who appreciated this allegiance least according to the mountains of documents and photographs which recorded  years of systematic jewish extermination were the good german citizens themselves one chronicler of the nazi holocaust said    aside from the indispensable fact of its minority status    long in the land deeply in and of its culture a familiar of its political and scientific thoroughfares yet racially distinct the jew was a german and he was not of the exact proportion of identity and difference he provided the perfect object for a transference of guilt it is tragic and ironic that the very effort of the jew to be assimilated into the german genus betrayed him most completely into the hands of his enemies even in early childhood mimicry is recognized as a stimulus for rage it is argued that in mimicry one may perceive ones own flaws in another and strike out against them with no pain to the ego with our high degree of black visibility we wisely substitute the word integration for the word assimilation but we mean the same thing the jews meant yes these were incredible people the jews incredibly wealthy incredibly knowledgeable incredibly blind for if their destruction as individuals can be attributed to any single factor it must surely be this their refusal to think and act as a racial group safe in their citizenship and motivated by their need to be accepted and assimilated by the germans they tried not to think of themselves as jews    preferring instead to be known as good germansuntil the dominant german society legislated away this dubious privilege in shortthey were voted out of the club baby you say it cant happen here do you know how many black men we have in congress fiveof a total of  you dont make the laws baby you are governed by them your secure status as an american citizen can be affected at the drop of an executive order as was the case in february  when occasioned by necessity the word can be equated with public hysteria president roosevelt signed executive order no  which set the stage for the internment of thousands of yellowskinned americans after pearl harbor american indignation focused with mounting fury on its yellowskinned citizens despite their complete lack of responsibility for and involvement with the attack as a matter of fact most of the japanese finally imprisoned in camps for their own safety and for the public good maintained their loyalty and allegiance to their country throughout their imprisonmentgoing to such unbelievable extremes as to  accept menial employment under guard outside the camps to hold bond drives within the camps and to volunteer for service in the armed forces ironically the famed nisei th infantry battalion a segregated unit composed primarily of japaneseamericancitizens was the most decorated american outfit in world war ii the fear which consumed white americans at the time was fear that other american citizens persons they thought of as yellowskinned first and citizens second would violently take over the government they were in short afraid of yellow power and this is the mood of the country at the moment possibly the position of the blackskinned american citizenwho contrary to the placid lawabiding japanese has said hell no we wont go to viet nam and who has burned thfc white mans cities looted his stores and demonstrated a frightening ability to proceed with a degree of singlemindedness toward an objective to follow the japanese without any previously established guilt on their part and as a preventive measure and in the interest of national security these citizens were summarily relocated in remote and arid wastelands hundreds of miles from their neat gardens their ranchstyle homes their red trs that they might comply with public law  passed in  by the congress of the united states to support the presidents executive order japanese businesses were closed farms placed in governmental custody belongings sold stored or destroyed homes locked and they with what possessions they could hurriedly throw in barracks bags and suitcases were bussed to their new homes an armed caucasian soldier sat in the front of each bus america is a christian country when discussing the imprisonment and immobilization of  of its slanteyed yellowskinned citizens it utilized a word with christian overtones evacuation evacuation implies a necessary but christian and merciful actwhen in actual fact to the doctors lawyers cooks gardeners housewives scientists students children who were evacuated from a correspondingly wide range of socioeconomic conditions to hastilv constructed wooden barracks and hastily petitioned and whitewashed horse barns still odorous it was a nightmare all the more horrible for its reality the semantics of prisoners versus evacuees need not be argued hitler was more direct early in  he avowed    we shall have to develop a technique of depopulation  i mean the removal of entire racial units one writer states the devious practice of arresting jews ostensibly for their own safety began about that time    the relocation of  nisei was not americas first experiment in depopulation nor is germany the only western country that has placidly watched the extermination of a race ask the american indiancitizen emeritus you who are flagwaving americans first and negroes only because you cant close your eyes every time you look in the mirror remember the jews and the nisei and if vou can handle it the indians the american    indian cant happen to you i wouldnt say that you may not take wallace reagan and welch seriously babv but there are a whole lot of j good white american citizens who do and thev vote how could it come about easily the first steps have already been taken in  a congress which had onlv one black member passed public law  which underwrote a wide extension of presidential authority supplied criminal penalties for the enforcement of partly unspecified military orders and approved a program which would immediately deprive on the basis of race an entire group of americans of their fundamental civil_rights even more important than pl  was the supreme court decision which followed its review of the japanese affair after hearing two cases one contesting the legality of the curfew imposed on a single ethnic group japanese and the other contesting the legality of the imprisonment itself the court hearing both cases long after the events declared both the curfew and the evacuation constitutional civil liberties are not absolute matters when liberties come into conflict with pressing public necessities liberties must give way whatever its shortcomings the famous holmes criterion of clear and present danger has in recent years been the most frequently utilized test of the us supreme court in determining the legality of civil liberties deprivations when the larger public stands in clear and present danger as the result of exercise of traditional liberties then one has no right to those liberties the magnitude of the civil liberties deprivation must be judged in terms of the threat to the common welfare    in one of the dissenting opinions mr justice murphy said the evacuation fell into the ugly abyss of racism continuing he said that the true test of evacuation was whether the civil liberties deprivation was reasonably related to a public danger that is so immediate imminent and impending as not to admit of delay and not to permit the intervention of ordinary constitutional processes to alleviate the danger the oncoming summer may provide just such a climateand there is obviously constitutional precedent for wholesale incarceration on the basis of race alone in the event the larger public feels it is in clear and present danger and you know who the larger public is the mccarran internal security act aimed ostensibly at subversives further compounds the legal web which is being spun while you watch the act passed in  by a congress which had two black members empowers a single person to declare an internal security emergency this catchall term can obviously be applied to any insurrection or civil_rights demonstrationcertainly to all areas in which rioting looting and violence are imminent or in progress and under title ii of the mccarran act six sites in america have been designated as detention camps to receive an intern detainees in the event such an emergency occurs the camps presentlv in varying states of repair and disrepair use and disuse are allenwood pa avon park fla el reno okla wickenburg ariz florence ariz and newell calif several of the camps are technically closed despite some evidence of maintenance others are being used for penal or other purposes very little is known about actual ownership of the avon land with that possible exception the us government has the right of immediate reentry

nyone who goes to africa is bound to hear the music and v to notice that it is different from western music what may  not be noticed is that the individual performer has complete  freedom for his own individual and inspired variation within fixed limits provided he keeps to the main rules an african performer may introduce as many subtle variations as he pleasesand all conceived on the spur of the moment it is spontaneous music one never hears the same song done exactly the same way when the african makes music what exactly does he do much research is being done on this subject even today and though we know much more about african music no one has yet been able to catch the essence of the african musicand this for many reasons transcribing the musicthe tempo of african music is fairly fast judged by western standards the average speed of drumming is seven unit beats per second this would be manageable if african music were susceptible to regular time bars   time and so on but it is not the african approach to rhythm is largely additive and so one is confronted with a series of rhythmic motifs of everchanging timelength which can only be intelligibly set down in a series of bars of continually changing value the only way possible to capture these rhythms is to devise some apparatus which will write down on a moving strip of paper every beat made by each instrument at the instant it is made recording on a gramophone and with a tape machine have failed to accurately measure the distance of one note from another besides this one has to discover the rhythms themselves and the musical pitch of each drum beat when the africans beat drums they play tunes on their drums therefore rhythm and time both have to be transcribed these are difficult to compare with the spontaneous creations of the master drummer at the very moment he plays them the social setting of the music has to be considered before the music as a whole can be said to have been mastered this is difficult when determining the rhythm of the song in a dance and its incidence with the other instruments such is the unity of the african music with african social life drumming and dancing are the center and climax of african music and it is necessary to pay attention to features of musical topology to the relation between speechtone and melody in singing because each tribe possesses its own musical idiosyncrasies it is very hard to transcribe african music so far i have tried to point out from my own experience and from the viewpoints of other musicologists why african music is a new field and why no one has yet been able to transcribe authoritatively its essence i have used the drum as an example because that is the first instrument that is heard in african music of any tribe another difficulty encountered in the transcribing of the african music is its norm the full ensemble of the dance all other forms of music are secondary the full ensemble consists of the instruments of the orchestra the handclapping the song and the dance these four ingredients combine to form the central act of african musicmaking in the full performance with singing and drumming we have the flower of african musical genius the highest manifestation of the art and the most spontaneously creative expression of the soul of music different tribes use different instruments but almost all use drums beneath all this diversity lies a unity of attitude to the dance for a large part of the african continent there are two fundamental principles of african music with special reference to handclapping and the accompanying songs the rhythm the melody the scoring of the drums the tuning and finally the instruments of the african orchestra are separately treated but one must remember that all these go together to give that mysterious and spiritual element to african music as to the religious element in african music almost all musicologists believe that africans had clearcut concepts of the role of music in life music permeates virtually every important phase of living in africa from birth to death singing related to religious activity had a specific character and specific requirements most africans had their own concepts of a supreme though not necessarily exclusive deity in many instances this deity tended to be somewhat remote and the africans dealingssupplicative invocational and placativewere with lesser supernatural beings many of whom had epic histories those who served these deities sang songs of praise much of the oral religious literature of the african consisted less of prayers as we think of them than of dramatic statements in the form of songs relating to the deities this is also very true of indian music and dance which originated in the form of prayers to the gods however the two fundamental principles of african music are  the tunebackground of the music be it handclap or a pestlebeat or a swish of the paddles in a canoesong or whatever the rhythmic background  the melody of the song attaches each syllable to its appropriate note that is the words and the time are inseparable handclapping is a normal way of providing percussive effect and maintaining a rhythmic pulse for singinga musical device of african derivation it is used in most childrens ring games and playparty songs clapping beat may or may not coincide with melodic accents often the clapping sounds fall squarely between the stressed voice tones and constitute a regular offbeat natalie curtis in her songs and tales from the dark continent has been able to transcribe correctly the wide spread african clap or bell pattern which might well be described as the african signature time and which is this she has noted down the time accurately but has not recognized its rhythm here is an example to illustrate the variety in african musical phrases the songfor girls the agbada river has caught me o i say that the todzie river has caught me o they say the wind on the lagoon has caught me o people should rescue me and may god guide me the song is the game the children form a ring the cantor starts the song and the chorus joins in all clap hands with a slow stroking movement moving their bodies too but without shifting their ground the musicthe song is common time throughout the claps fall on the first beat of each bar the song consists of  claps it is not  bars because it is the claps which are the timebackbone of the song the bars do not exist so far as the african is concerned the song consists of  groups of  claps the rest of the song is one phrase of four claps the total is  claps the african musical phrase  does not exist the african phrases are built up of the numbers  or  their multiples of a combination of  and  or the multiples of this combination thus this phrase of  is thus repeated     the division being   the song is in call and response form though on repeats the chorus sings the whole of it most african singing is built on this cantor and chorus basis though there are a number of different ways in which the principle may be developed to illustrate the rhythmic fusion of dancing singing and clappinga song for little boys and girls ahiavia yeye tsoe da de abatia dzi nam loo ahiavia gbogbo tsoe da de abatia dzi nam loo my small lover you are welcome put it on the bed for me it refers to the headkerchief the boy has brought as a present all form a circle one child acts as cantor and starts singing at the word yeye they all clap after the song has started any one dancer moves into the circle dances for about three repeats and dances out to herhis former place music the one feature that should be noticed is at the word yeye the syncopation here occurs three timesonly at the beginning and no where else there are two claps to this song which are performed simultaneously some children doing one and some the other without prearrangement the first is a regular succession of claps of crochet value of the same intensity if the second clap is performed by itself and without the song it appears to be of a certain regular pattern but it is not quite this in order to get the rhythm of the second clap the performer adds silently in his head some extra claps during the rests in his pattern and mentally plays the following pattern in combination with clap one thus the rhythm established is two claps and a pauserepeat there are  crochets to the whole song ie  rose brandel in her transcripts makes the important contribution of the realization that the pitch of the drums and of their individual drumbeats is important she actually gives the pitch of one drum b b below middle c for other drums she gives the relative pitches of the drumnotes forming the musical patterns of each drum but she does not correlate the pitches of the several drums with one another she is aware of the polyrhythms of the drum music but does not realize the fundamental principles involved the scoring of the drums presents another problem with melodic instruments used in the west the scores indicates the pitch of the notes required there is no need to show how they are produced but with the african drums the situation is different in the first place the drum does not give out a clearly defined note which the ear can easily recognize as being of definite pitch moreover there is a difference in pitch of one drum note to another a difference that extends over more than an  octave african drumbeats vary not only in pitch but also in quality therefore it is important in the case of drumming to know which hand a performer uses for any given note and how he played the note the score should ideally show not only the rhythm and the pitch of the notes but also how each note was made to place the drum notes on a musical stave  facts have to be considered  which hand played it  what position on the drumskin it was played  whether or not the other hand was also employed simultaneously in producing it and if so in what way the drums the core of the african instrumentation are often grouped in sets or families of three they are of various sizes as high as three feet and are made of hollow logs covered at one end by sheep hide this instrument of african parentage so popular today was and still is used in many remote areas of africa used for a variety of purposes for calling and signalling announcing death social dances harvest rites wakes and funerals the beats of all the other instruments shows a very high state of development it is especially complex and subtle in its rhythmic organization the very essence of african music is to cross the rhythms this does not mean syncopation by crossing the rhythm we mean if two africans are drumming in triple time and at the same speed the main beat of the bars of no  drum will fall either on the second beat or on the third beat of number one drum but never on the first this is absolutely fundamental to african music the same is true of indian music and indian tabla small drums we find here the same movement from complication of rhythm and meter to greater unity and coincidence that was found in indian and other oriental music orchestraafrican stylewith particular reference to rwe a west african tribe the orchestra consists of three sections the background rhythm section the drum section and claps and song the instruments include the drums the double bell gonkogui two high pitched gongs called atoke each with its playing rod made of iron similar instruments are used by different tribes and are called by different names but they play the same role as mentioned here the background rhythmic sectionthe gonkogui is the foundation of the section it is a double clapperless belltwo bells welded at the top to form a tine by which it is held when played with a stick it gives two clear notes in which the upper partials are inaudible this provides the background rhythm which keeps the whole orchestra in time what gonkogui plays is a rhythm pattern and not a succession of regular beats the one responsible for the actual tempo is the master drummer the gonkogui is accompanied by axatse a rattle the rattle pattern is derived from those of gonggong but is not identical again different tribes have different playing techniques the rattle shake gives an intense clattering sound of high pitch the downward stroke produces a low slightly muffled sound the upward stroke sounds crisp and high atoke is another gonglike instrument which is used as background rhythm small and boatshaped it is couched in the hand without the fingers touching the ends the desired sound is a very high rather thin and slightly metallic singing tone the drums are the most important section of the orchestra forming its main body about four drums are used normally i have already explained the rhythm and the score involved however what the exact factors are which determine the tuning is a difficult matter to find what exactly is the african listening to it is not a case of absolute pitch it must be so tuned that the notes rise and fall very clearly the third section of the orchestra is the song and its attendant handclapping the handclap is the rhythmic link between the song and the other instruments so true of other tribal music the clap phrase and the phrases of the instrument supplying background music eg gonkogui are always in the same phrase one with the other the songs are in free rhythm though this is illusory when the song is sung and repeated its syllables and claps fall in exactly the same equivalent places in the gonkogui pattern in this instance finally in most african music tension operates within the phrase and is the organizing articulating principle of the phrase but tension does not perform an overall organizing function except in the sense that it creates a type of variations form these instruments though lacking the precision of western technology still recognizably belong to the familiar families of wind string and percussiononly they produce a dilferent rhythm and a different melody so appealing and pleasant to the ear considering afroamerican folk music it is difficult to explore it or understand it properly without recognizing its african heritage this does not mean that afroamerican music is african but that many characteristics of african musical styles persist to this day two of these characteristics are melodic and rhythmic concepts which are most noticeable and easily recognized in order to captivate the essence of african music it is necessary not only to hear it but to see it with ones own eyes the drummer beating the drums the dancers dancing in complete harmony with the drumbeatings and the singers singing in complete harmony with the clapping no matter how strange it may sound in the beginning if hearing for the first time one is soon absorbed in tapping the floor with the foot or clapping the hands mentally if not audibly 
aime cesaire
by ellen conroy kennedy
e had arrived in the w middle of the first world festival of negro arts a three week international spectacle held in the senegalese capital in april  bringing together from africa europe the caribbean north and south america black artists writers performers scholars in expositions of every art form from ancient to contemporary in handicraft sculpture painting dance theater music films literaturethe whole prefaced by a weeklong colloquium on the function and meaning of negro art in the life of the people see negro digestjune july august september  the exhilaration was contagious my own was dampened only by the fatigue of a transatlantic flight and the knowledge we had missed by just a few hours the nuit de la poesie a gala evening of dramatic readings by the senegalese actor bachir toure followed by the solemn awarding of festival prizes in the numerous categories of competition a poetry reading the key event of a festival of negro arts yes but for the selfaffirmative poetry through which  years earlier a small group of african and west indian students in paris found their authentic voice rediscovered what they called their negritude the  festival would never have taken place it was through this extraordinary body of writings the poems of aime cesaire leopold senghor birago and david diop bernard dadie jacques rabemananjara and othersthat negritude first found expression it has matured since then from a simple protest against cultural assimilation into a cultural philosophy now articulated by leopold senghor president of senegal as a new humanism in which the negros special contribution to world culture will at last have a fully recognized share so the marriage of a gala poetry reading and the awarding of festival prizes was particularly fitting i scanned the pages of dakar matin for a report of the evening and the literary prizes the elder poets aime cesaire and leopold senghor for example were not in the running of course from their group had come the juries to single out for honors writers of a younger generation cesaire who invented negritude philosophical premise of the festival and leader  of the literary school grown up around it had headed the french language literary jury i read while the american poet langston hughes was chairman of the english language section it was these elders whose work is still so little translated and so little known in the united states who drew my interest most theirs were the works  knew and would teach i would have a chance to meet many of them i was soon told at a special postcolloquium session where the madagascan poetstatesman jacques rabemananjara would speak two evenings later that evening aime cesaire leon damas alioune diop bernard dadie birago diop most of the festivals french language literary notables though not that visitorfromanotherplanet evgeny yevtuschenko were circulating among the crowd gathered in the lobby of the assemblee nationale w the effect was rather like seeing mallarme rimbaud verlaine corbiere and laforgue all in one room only negritudes baudelaire president senghor seemed to be missing yet his presence was felt in every way but the physical since the festival was surely his creation more than any other single persons langston hughes was on hand too autographing books in green ink with wide round palmer method letters for mr hughes was one of the surviving grand old men of the s harlem renaissance his poems and stories together with those of gaude mackay countee cullen and jean toomer had had a profound impact on the originators of negritude negro students from french colonies in africa and the caribbean who read them in paris a decade later like hughes cesaire was seated at a card table chatting with clusters of admirers writing gracious dedications in copies of the various works they presented him his poetry les armes miraculeuses ferrements cadastre his plays one of which la tragedie du roi christophe later marked a high point of the festival with senghor and haile selassie in gala attendance his essays the discours sur le colonialisme the lettre a maurice thorez his  resignation from the french communist party and his study of the haitian revolutionary toussaint vouverture i recognized him instantly with something of a start yet how could one have expected to find the same young militant whose dark face incendiary eyes and radiant white smile glow forth from a  photograph today in his fifties the poets eyes are softened with spectacles his face a trifle lined and heavier his fervor perhaps not dampened but seasoned by more than  years as poet parliamentarian for the former lycee professor is also the longtime mayor of his home town fortaufrance and deputy from his island martinique to the chambre des deputes in paris turning his attention toward us cesaire flashed the invincible magnetic smile edouard maunick the young mauritian poet we had met the day before murmured an introduction i passed monsieur cesaire several volumes to autograph mentioning my regret at not having found a copy of his first and still bestknown work cahier dun retour au pays natal this is the poem the late andre breton dean of french surrealists called nothing less than the greatest lyric monument of our time in which he discovered that major tone which distinguishes great from lesser poets publication of les armes miraculeuses just after world war ii and of the first complete edition of the cahier soon afterwards established cesaire in the front rank of french poets he was hailed as the great renewer of surrealism though his originality was far more than simply stylistic the ethnic element his magnificent messianic identification with all peoples of african heritage these thematic qualities were still more distinctive the poets close friend senghor has spoken of the cahiers parturition in pain the pain of its genesis in the  year old poets anguished confrontation with the misery of his island his people his race a dramatic monologue of some  pages his notes on a return to the native land begins as a bitterly ironic inventory of rage despair and frustration to become an exorcism and then an acceptance an immense surging affirmation of the poets negroness of all negroness and a personal dedication to its cause    you know it is not from hate for other races that i seek to be the plowman of this single race    what i wish for the universal hunger for the universal thirst is to shake it free at last to summon from its inner depths the succulence of fruit if leon damas startling poems pigments  were the first rejection of cultural assimilation cesaires cahier written in  was the first direct lyric proclamation of negritude his words as jeanpaul sartre has put it do not describe negritude they do not designate it they do not copy it from outside as a painter does a model they make it they compose it under our eyes one of the great poems of our century the cahier dun retour au pays natal is the literary movements inspirational emblem the one incomparable work to which all african and west indian poets in french refer in whose stature they are measured  alas the cahier was temporarily out of print cesaire said and when would there be a new american edition i knew there had been a bilingual version of only  copies with translations by ivan goll and lionel abel published in  by brentanos in new york surely it was time it were available again a cuban refugee we knew owned wifredo lams original drawings for another edition the frenchspanish one published in havana in  couldnt an american publisher put them together for a new frenchenglish edition why not smiled cesaire and as for the drawings if the old ones were not enough perhaps wifredo would make new ones had he lams address yes in a notebook at his brothers villa where he was staying during the festival the poet jotted down a phone number on a tiny leaf of graphed notepaper asking us to call a few days later since he was leaving the city that evening cesaire and one or two other close friends maunick later told us would be spending those few days in casamance the lush southern part of senegal as guests of president senghor but now others were waiting to speak to the poet we said goodbye and moved on the interview itself came about unexpectedly i phoned on the appointed afternoon cesaire had just lunched he would be tied up the following day our last in dakar but now he had an hour to spare before the dress rehearsal of la tragedie du roi christophe cesaires play about the rise and fall of henrichristophe despot ruler of independent th century haiti was a highpoint of the festival its pertinence to the careers of certain contemporary african statesmen was not lost on the dakar audience would my husband and i care to come over right away we were delighted and asked if we could bring along a journalist friend who was also anxious to meet him the taxi left us in front of a large townhouse just visible through the iron gate in a sixfoot high wall we rang and cesaire himself came down to meet us ushering us through a small garden up a flight of stairs to the parlor floor we stepped through a corridor into a spacious highceilinged room its coolness refreshing after the almost blinding sunshine outside a tall shuttered window on the far side was open letting in the sea breeze that brings relief in dakar even from the intense midday heat leaning out one caught a green glimpse framed in the deep blue of sky and water of the ancient fortress island goree here for more than  years captives from the african interior were held prisoner in slavedepots before their deportation west to the americas a museum now the prison can be reached by motor launch from the harbor of dakar in  minutes during the festival it was the scene of a nightly soundandlight spectacular we shook hands and i introduced the journalist friend who had accompanied us did monsieur cesaire understand english more or less he indicated though he preferred not to try to speak it we decided to put our questions in french and i would interpret if needed occasionally as we talked he would repeat a question in french to check that he had understood it properly as he spoke i noticed he had the trace of a lisp it interfered not at all with the warmth the thoughtfulness and precision with which he talked sometimes moving forward in his chair occasionally breaking into smiles pausing or altering his inflection to emphasize a point 
where white and black meet
by frantz fanon
ie negro to whites is a phobogenic object a stimulus to anxiety from the patient treated by serieux and capgras to the girl who confides to me that to go to bed with a negro would be terrifying to her one discovers all the stages of what i shall call the negrophobogenesis there has been much talk of psychoanalysis in connection with the negro distrusting the ways in which it might be applied  i have preferred to call this chapter the negro and psychopathology well aware that freud and adler and even the cosmic jung did not think of the negro in all their investigations and they were quite right not to have it is too often forgotten that neurosis is not a basic element of human reality like it or not the oedipus complex is far from coming into being among negroes it might be argued as malinowski contends that the matriarchal structure is the only reason for its absence but putting aside the question whether the ethnologists are not so imbued with the complexes of their own civilization that they are compelled to try to find them duplicated in the peoples they study it would be relatively easy for me to show that in the french antilles  per cent of the families cannot produce one oedipal neurosis this incapacity is one on which we heartily congratulate ourselves with the exception of a few misfits within the closed environment we can say that every neurosis every abnormal manifestation every affective erethism in an antillean is the product of his cultural situation in other words there is a constellation of postulates a series of propositions that slowly and subtlywith the help of books newspapers schools and their texts advertisements films radiowork their way into ones mind and shape ones view of the world of the group to which one belongs in the antilles that view of the world is white because no black voice exists the folklore of martinique is meager and few children in fortdefrance know the stories of compe lapin twin brother of the brer rabbit of louisianas uncle remus a european familiar with the current trends of negro poetry for example would be amazed to learn that as late as  no antillean found it possible to think of himself as a negro it was only with the appearance of aime cesaire that the acceptance of negritude and the statement of its claims began to be perceptible the most concrete proof of this furthermore is that feeling which pervades each new generation of students arriving in paris it takes them several weeks to recognize that contact with europe compels them to face a certain number of problems that until their arrival had never touched them and yet these problems were by no means invisible i   whenever i had a discussion with my professors or talked with european patients i became aware of the differences that might prevail between the two worlds talking recently to a physician who had always practiced in fortdefrance i told him what conclusions i had arrived at he went farther saying that they were valid not only in psychopathology but also in general medicine in the same way he added you never encounter a case of pure typhoid such as you studied in the textbooks there is always a more or less manifest complication of malaria it would be interesting to study for example a case of schizophrenia as experienced by a negroif indeed that kind of malady were to be found there what am i getting at quite simply this when the negro makes contact with the white world a certain sensitizing action takes place if his psychic structure is weak one observes a collapse of the ego the black man stops behaving as an actional person the goal of his behavior will be the other in the guise of the white man for the other alone can give him worth that is on the ethical level selfesteem but there is something else i have said that the negro is phobogenic what is phobia i prefer to answer that question by relying on the latest work of hesnard phobia is a neurosis characterized by the anxious fear of an object in the broadest sense of anything outside the individual or by extension of a situation naturally that object must have certain aspects it must arouse hesnard says both fear and revulsion but here we encounter a difficulty applying the genetic method to the understanding of phobia charles odier wrote that all anxiety derives from a certain subjective insecurity linked to the absence of the mother this occurs according to odier sometime in the second year of life investigating the psychic structure of the phobic he comes to this conclusion before attacking the adult beliefs all the elements of the infantile structure which produced them must be analyzed the choice of the phobic object is therefore overdetermined this object does not come at random out of the void of nothingness in some situation it has previously evoked an affect in the patient his phobia is the latent presence of this affect at the root of his world there is an organization that has been given a form for the object naturally need not be there it is enough that somewhere it exist it is a possibility this object is endowed with evil intentions and with all the attributes of a malefic power in the phobic affect has a priority that defies all rational thinking as we can see the phobic is a person who is governed by the laws of rational prelogic and affective prelogic methods of thinking and feeling that go back to the age at which he experienced the event that impaired his security the difficulty indicated here is this was there a trauma harmful to security in the case of the young woman whom we mentioned a little earlier in the majority of negrophobic men has there been an attempt at rape an attempt at fellatio proceeding with complete orthodoxy we should be led by the application of analytic conclusions to this if an extremely frightening object such as a more or less imaginary attacker arouses terror this is alsofor most often such cases are those of womenand especially a terror mixed with sexual revulsion im afraid of men really means at the bottom of the motivation of the fear because they might do all kinds of things to me but not commonplace cruelties sexual abusesin other words immoral and shameful things contact alone is enough to evoke anxiety for contact is at the same time the basic schematic type of initiating sexual action touching caressessexuality since we have learned to know all the tricks the ego uses in order to defend itself we know too that its denials must in no case be taken literally are we not now observing a complete inversion basically does this fear of rape not itself cry out for rape just as there are faces that ask to be slapped can one not speak of women who ask to be raped in if he hollers let him go chester himes describes this type very well the big blonde trembles whenever the negro goes near her yet she has nothing to fear since the factory is full of white men in the end she and the negro go to bed together when i was in military service i had the opportunity to observe the behavior of white women from three or four european countries when they were among negroes at dances most of the time the women made involuntary gestures of flight of withdrawing their faces filled with a fear that was not feigned and yet the negroes who asked them to dance would have been utterly unable to commit any act at all against them even if they had wished to do so the behavior of these women is clearly understandable from the standpoint of imagination that is because the negrophobic woman is in fact nothing but a putative sexual partner just as the negrophobic man is a repressed homosexual in relation to the negro everything takes place on the genital level a few years ago i remarked to some friends during a discussion that in a general sense the white man behaves toward the negro as an elder brother reacts to the birth of a younger i have since learned that richard sterba arrived at the same conclusion in america on the phenomenological level there would be a double reality to be observed the jew is feared because of his potential for acquisitiveness they are everywhere the banks the stock exchanges the government are infested with them they control everything soon the whole country will belong to them they do better in examinations than the real frenchmen soon they will be making the laws for us not long ago an acquaintance studying for the civil service said to me say what you want they take good care of one another when moch was in power for instance the number of kikes in government jobs was appalling in the medical profession the situation is no different every jewish student who wins a prize in a competition does it through pull as for the negroes they have tremendous sexual powers what do you expect with all the freedom they have in their jungles they copulate at all times and in all places they are really genital they have so many children that they cannot even count them be careful or they will flood us with little mulattoes things are indeed going to hell    the government and the civil service are at the mercy of the jews our women are at the mercy of the negroes for the sexual potency of the negro is hallucinating that is indeed the word this potency must be hallucinating psychoanalysts who study the problem soon enough find the mechanisms of every neurosis sexual anxiety is predominant here all the negrophobic women i have known had abnormal sex lives their husbands had left them or they were widows and they were afraid to find a substitute for the dead husband or they were divorced and they had doubts at the thought of a new object investment all of them endowed the negro with powers that other men husbands transient lovers did not have and besides there was also an element of perversion the persistence of infantile formations god knows how they make love it must be terrifying  there is one expression that through time has become singularly eroticized the black athlete there is something in the mere idea one young woman confided to me that makes the heart skip a beat a prostitute told me that in her early days the mere thought of going to bed with a negro brought on an orgasm she went in search of negroes and never asked them for money but she added going to bed with them was no more remarkable than going to bed with white men it was before i did it that i had the orgasm i used to think about imagine all the things they might do to me and that was what was so terrific still on the genital level when a white man hates black men is he not yielding to a feeling of impotence or of sexual inferiority since his ideal is an infinite virility is there not a phenomenon of diminution in relation to the negro who is viewed as a penis symbol is the lynching of the negro not a sexual revenge we know how much of sexuality there is in all cruelties tortures beatings one has only to reread a few pages of the marquis de sade to be easily convinced of the fact is the negros superiority real everyone knows that it is not but that is not what matters the prelogical thought of the phobic has decided that such is the case another woman developed a negrophobia after she had read jirai cracher sur vos tombes i tried to demonstrate the irrationality of her position by pointing out to her that victimized white women were as sick as the negro besides i added this was no case of black vengeance as the title of the book might seem to imply because the author was a white man boris vian i had to accept the futility of all such efforts that young woman did not want to listen anyone who has read the book will understand at once the ambivalence her phobia revealed i knew a negro medical student who would not dare to make a vaginal examination of any patient in the gynecological clinic he told me that one day he had heard one of them say theres a nigger in there if he touches me ill slap his face you never know with them he must have great big hands and besides hes sure to be rough if one wants to understand the racial situation psychoanalytically not from a universal viewpoint but as it is experienced by individual consciousnesses considerable importance must be given to sexual phenomena in the case of the jew one thinks of money and its cognates in that of the negro one thinks of sex antisemitism can be rationalized on a basic level it is because he takes over the country that the jew is a danger an acquaintance told me recently that although he was not an antisemite he had been constrained to admit that the majority of jews whom he had known during the war had behaved very badly i tried in vain to get him to concede that such a statement was the fruit of a determined desire to find the essence of the jew wherever it might exist on a clinical level i am reminded of the story of the young woman who suffered from a kind of tactile delirium constantly washing her hands and arms ever since the day a jew had been introduced to her jeanpaul sartre has made a masterful study of the problem of antisemitism let us try to determine what are the constituents of negrophobia this phobia is to be found on an instinctual biological level at the extreme i should say that the negro because of his body impedes the closing of the postural schema of the white manat the point naturally at which the black man makes his entry into the phenomenal world of the white man this is not the place in which to state the conclusions i drew from studying the influence exerted on the body by the appearance of another body let us assume for example that four fifteenyearold boys all more or less athletic are doing the high jump one of them wins by jumping four feet ten inches then a fifth boy arrives and tops the mark by a halfinch the four other bodies experience a destructuration what is important to us here is to show that with the negro the cycle of the biological begins the penis the symbol of manhood is annihilated which is to say that it is denied the difference between the two attitudes is apparent the jew is attacked in his religious identity in his history in his race in his relations with his ancestors and with his posterity when one sterilizes a jew one cuts off the source every time that a jew is persecuted it is the whole race that is persecuted in his person but it is in his corporeality that the negro is attacked it is as a concrete personality that he is lynched it is as an actual being that he is a threat the jewish menace is replaced by the fear of the sexual potency of the negro o mannoni said an argument widely used by racialists against those who do not share their convictions is worthy of mention for its revealing character what they say if you had a daughter do you mean to say that you would marry her to a negro i have seen people who appeared to have no racialist bias lose all critical sense when confronted with this kind of question the reason is that such an argument disturbs certain uneasy feelings in them more exactly incestuous feelings and they turn to racialism as a defence reaction before we go further it seems important to make this point granted that unconscious tendencies toward incest exist why should these tendencies emerge more particularly with respect to the negro in what way taken as an absolute does a black soninlaw differ from a white soninlaw is there not a reaction of unconscious tendencies in both cases why not for instance conclude that the father revolts because in his opinion the negro will introduce his daughter into a sexual universe for which the father does not have the key the weapons or the attributes every intellectual gain requires a loss in sexual potential the civilized white man retains an irrational longing for unusual eras of sexual license of orgiastic scenes of unpunished rapes of unrepressed incest in one way these fantasies respond to freuds life instinct projecting his own desires onto the negro the white man behaves as if the negro really had them when it is a question of the jew the problem is clear he is suspect because he wants to own the wealth or take over the positions of power but the negro is fixated at the genital or at any rate he has been fixated there two realms the intellectual and the sexual an erection on rodins thinker is a shocking thought one cannot decently have a hard on everywhere the negro symbolizes the biological danger the jew the intellectual danger to suffer from a phobia of negroes is to be afraid of the biological for the negro is only biological the negroes are animals they go about naked and god alone knows    mannoni said further in his urge to identify the anthropoid apes caliban the negroes even the jews with the mythological figures of the satyrs man reveals that there are sensitive spots in the human soul at a level where thought becomes confused and where sexual excitement is strangely linked with violence and aggressiveness mannoni includes the jew in his scale i see nothing inappropriate there but here the negro is the master he is the specialist of this matter whoever says rape says negro over three or four years i questioned some  members of the white racefrench german english italian i took advantage of a certain air of trust of relaxation in each instance i waited until my subject no longer hesitated to talk to me quite openlythat is until he was sure that he would not offend me or else in the midst of associational tests i inserted the word negro among some twenty others almost  per cent of the replies took this form negro brought forth biology penis strong athletic potent boxer joe louis jesse owens senegalese troops savage animal devil sin senegalese soldier used as the stimulus evoked dreadful bloody tough strong it is interesting to note that one in fifty reacted to the word negro with nazi or  when one knows the emotional meaning of the ss image one recognizes that the difference from the other answers is negligible let me add that some europeans helped me by giving the test to their acquaintances in such cases the proportion went up notably from this result one must acknowledge the effect of my being a negro unconsciously there was a certain reticence the negro symbolizes the biological first of all he enters puberty at the age of nine and is a father at the age of ten he is hotblooded and his blood is strong he is tough as a white man remarked to me not long ago with a certain bitterness you all have strong constitutions what a beautiful racelook at the senegalese    werent they called our black devils during the war    but they must be brutal  i just cant see them putting those big hands of theirs on my shoulders i shudder at the mere thought of it    well aware that in certain cases one must interpret by opposites i understand this extrafragile woman at bottom what she wants most is to have the powerful negro bruise her frail shoulders sartre says that when one speaks the phrase a young jewess there is an imaginary reek of rape and pillage    conversely we might say that the expression a handsome negro contains a possible allusion to similar phenomena i have always been struck by the speed with which handsome young negro turns into young colt or stallion in the film mourning becomes electra a good part of the plot is based on sexual rivalry orin rebukes his sister vinnie because she admired the splendid naked natives of the south seas he cannot forgive her for it analysis of the real is always difficult an investigator can choose between two attitudes toward his subject first he can be satisfied only to describe in the manner of those anatomists who are all surprised when in the midst of a description of the tibia they are asked how many fibular depressions they have that is because in their researches there is never a question of themselves but of others in the beginning of my medical studies after several nauseating sessions in the dissection room i asked an older hand how i could prevent such reactions my friend pretend youre dissecting a cat and everything will be all right    second once he has described reality the investigator can make up his mind to change it in principle however the decision to describe seems naturally to imply a critical approach and therefore a need to go farther toward some solution both authorized and anecdotal literature have created too many stories about negroes to be suppressed but putting them all together does not help us in our real task which is to disclose their mechanics what matters for us is not to collect facts and behavior but to find their meaning here we can refer to jaspers when he wrote comprehension in depth of a single instance will often enable us phenomenologically to apply this understanding in general to innumerable cases often what one has once grasped is soon met again what is important in phenomenology is less the study of a large number of instances than the intuitive and deep understanding of a few individual cases the question that arises is this can the white man behave healthily toward the black man and can the black man behave healthily toward the white man a pseudoquestion some will say but when we assert that european culture has an imago of the negro which is responsible for all the conflicts that may arise we do not go beyond reality in the chapter on language we saw that on the screen the negro faithfully reproduces that imago even serious writers have made themselves its spokesmen so it was that michel cournot could write the black mans sword is a sword when he has thrust it into your wife she has really felt something it is a revelation in the chasm that it has left your little toy is lost pump away until the room is awash with your sweat you might as well just be singing this is goodby    four negroes with their penises exposed would fill a cathedral they would be unable to leave the building until their erections had subsided and in such close quarters that would not be a simple matter to be comfortable without problems they always have the open air but then they are faced with a constant insult the palm tree the breadfruit tree and so many other proud growths that would not slacken for an empire erect as they are for all eternity and piercing heights that are not easily reached at any price when one reads this passage a dozen times and lets oneself gothat is when one abandons oneself to the movement of its imagesone is no longer aware of the negro but only of a penis the negro is eclipsed he is turned into a penis he is a penis it is easy to imagine what such descriptions can stimulate in a young girl in lyon horror lust not indifference in any case now what is the truth the average length of the penis among the black men of africa dr pales says rarely exceed  millimeters  inches testut in his traite danatomie hwnaine offers the same figure for the european but these are facts that persuade no one the white man is convinced that the negro is a beast if it is not the length of the penis then it is the sexual potency that impresses him face to face with this man who is different from himself he needs to defend himself in other words to personify the other the other will become the mainstay of his preoccupations and his desires the prostitute whom i mentioned earlier told me that her hunt for negroes dated from the time when she had been told this story one night a woman who was in bed with a negro went mad she remained insane for two years but then when she had been cured refused to go to bed with anyone else the prostitute did not know what had driven the other woman mad but she sought furiously to reproduce the same situation to discover this secret which was part of the ineffable one must recognize that what she wanted was the destruction the dissolution of her being on a sexual level every experiment that she made with a negro reinforced her limitations this delirium of orgasm was unattainable she could not experience it so she avenged herself by losing herself in speculation one thing must be mentioned in this connection a white woman who has had a negro lover finds it difficult to return to white men or so at least it is believed particularly by white men who knows what they can give a woman who indeed does know certainly they do not on this subject i cannot overlook this comment by etiemble racial jealousy produces the crimes of racism to many white men the black is simply that marvelous sword which once it has transfixed their wives leaves them forever transfigured my statistical sources have been able to provide me with no documentation on this point i have however known some negroes some white women who have had negroes and finally some negro women who have had white lovers i have heard enough confidences from all of them to be able to deplore the fact that m cournot applies his talents to the rejuvenation of a fable in which the white man will always be able to find a specious argument shameful dubious and thus doubly effective  
crisis of consciousness
by richard a long
american artist  of african descent has j ii r had certain options l he could insulate himself as anist and a person usually by expatriation he could keep his art pure while reacting personally to his condition he could respond to that condition by and with his artistic expressivity these choices have roughly characterized three periods of expression in the plastic arts by afroamericans while no means alone henry ossawa tanner  illustrates the first option a pupil of thomas eakins he reflects some of the lessons of that master in the banjo lesson now at hampton institute this painting is clearly a masterpiece of the american genre school but in seeking his artistic identity tanner found it necessary to go to france as had eakins before him and unlike eakins to remain there a portion of tanners considerable achievement has been recognized in a recent exhibition at new yorks grand central galleries the second option is demonstrated by laura wheeler waring  she like tanner and the sculptress meta warrick fuller was a graduate of the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts she followed a career in teaching all the while painting portraits and stilllife with quiet elegance and style the third option that of using art as the means of expressing a distinct ethnic identity in the context of american society did not appear yesterday during the twenties the period of the harlem renaissance it was the explicit program of young writers such as langston hughes it received the encouragement of alain locke and james weldon johnson who were the revered spokesmen of an older generation the work of aaron douglas at that time was hailed as reflecting this spirit in painting and it was he who was selected to illustrate dr lockes the new negro and other ethnic books of the period dr locke remained ever on the search for an artist who would embody his ideal of an ethnic afroamerican expression nevertheless the harlem renaissance did not produce artists who could be fully compared with its writers in this respect the problems of the artist are different and he reacts differently formal considerations arise which place questions of subject and content aside sometimes for a long period some times indefinitely two examples may be mentioned the first is w h johnson born in  in south carolina he studied at the national academy of design in new york in the early twenties in  he went to france remaining there until  nineteenthirty found him once more in europe this time in denmark where he married a danish artist only in  was he once more in the u s where world war ii forced him to remain until  his works after student days reflect a cezannesque french period an expressionistic scandinavian period and an astounding primitive american period the result of the artistic rediscovery of his ethnic origins in  the highly sophisticated vision of his exile was rudely displaced by a basic upheaval even more imperative than it at first seemed for a mental collapse followed the first large scale exhibition of johnsons work was held at the college museum hampton institute in the spring of  drawing on hamptons holdings and those of the national collection of fine arts both gifts of the harmon foundation beauford delaney a painter of the same generation as johnson went from rural kentucky to boston where his studies at the school of fine arts began with drawings from the antique he came to new york at the end of the twenties as the harlem renaissance was drawing to a close his personal vision led him from an early academicism to a hearty expressionism culminating in a long series of green street paintings in the forties beauford delaney went to paris in the fifties where his evolution has been toward an abstract impressionism of great subtlety ever an ethnically conscious person delaneys long absence from the united states has been in no sense an exile his rumination in the past and his active contemplation of the present encompass the broad spectrum of black experience in america his new york period has been apotheosized by henry miller in remember to remember and the paris period by james baldwin in a glowing tribute printed as introduction to delaneys galerie lambert show  an ensemble of his work has been on permanent exhibition at morgan state college in baltimore since  the artistic program of the harlem renaissance was partially realized by a number of artists who first appeared during the wpa period such as charles alston jacob lawrence and charles sebree associated with the mood and spirit of the wpa are the mexicaninspired murals of hale woodruff at talladega and at atlanta university and of charles white at hampton institute there was a tendency during the wpa period to see the afroamerican experience from either a populist or marxist viewpoint and therefore as part of a universal one the artists tended to regard the content of their work as reflecting in a particular way a universal problem concomitant with this then was a general feeling that no identification of an artist as negro or afroamerican was desirable or necessary this may be said to have been the position of most afroamerican artists in the period from the end of the depression to less than four years ago what then has happened why do we now hear of afroamerican artists what is the significance of an exhibition which can draw   people to the great hall of city university in new york as did the evolution of afroamerican artists  last october no simple answer is possible it must be remembered though that there was a similar exhibition assembled by alonzo aden in chicago in  hence what we are witnessing may be cyclical on the other hand there are two influences one international and one domestic to which the artist necessarily responds the domestic one which has been summed up in the slogans white backlash and black_power the first certainly preceded the second hence why not white power and black backlash is an increasing source of personal frustration to all americans of african descent the second is negritude a philosophy of african values and insights proposed as a substitute foror complement toeuroamerican materialist values a philosophy which not unsurprisingly finds its immediate source in the harlem renaissance the crisis of consciousness which the afroamerican artist is undergoing today is similar to that of the entire community to which he belongs a community which is in large part of somebody elses making the observed ferment may be an attempt on the part of that community to remake itself in a manner that is emotionally satisfying the role of the artist in this enterprise could be a great one  
beg your pardon my dear sirbut you canf t possibly be an african
on the contrary the gentleman pictured here is a tribal chieftain from the province of timbo in guinea one of the frenchspeaking countries of west africa and the ancestral home of many thousands of american negroes he is a slender proud amberhued young man who divested of his traditional boubou and dressed in western attire would be indistinguishable from any other goodlooking intelligent young man seen say on the streets of detroit or atlanta to a nation of people accustomed to thinking of africans in the images fostered for so long by the communications media the guinean might come as a shock but he is very real and very african what then is an african an african is a person from africa just as an american is a person from america and there are at least as many variations in the colors and facial characteristics of africans as there are among americans an african might be a blueeyed blond from the kabyles of algeria or an ebonyblack wolof from senegal what the people of these extremely divergent groups have in common as do hundreds of groups ranging between their two poles is a heritage on the african continent which goes back many hundreds of years throughout the centuries there have been blending among these various peoples just as there have been among the different groups in europe or asia or the americas and just as there always will be where human beings come together american movies cartoons news features and often television shows have tended to picture africans as primitive sometimes savage people without traditions or culture thus contributing criminally to the worlds ignorance but now it is possible to know africans as they truly are the knowledge will enrich you
