{\bf Trends in contextual association score between the phrase \emph{martin-luther-king} and \emph{assassination} for the two magazines of study - \emph{Negro Digest/Black World} and \emph{Ebony}. The association score jumps 1968 onwards after Dr. King's assassination, with the jump being more clear in the \emph{Ebony} magazine. The association scores were computed by first cosine similarities of the word projections from the \emph{word2vec} model (ref), with subsequent refinement of these similarity values by the \emph{CorShrink} method (ref).
