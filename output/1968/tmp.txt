lerone bennetts article was abe lincoln a wliite supremacist february was clear rspmsible and well supported it is hard to give up the idea of a messiali a man of total justice filled with love of his fellow man but the most unpleas int truth is better than even the prettiest lie best of all mr bennett presented us with a man who was not totally false after being diested of his fictitious glory a believable even admirable abe lincoln a man who was able to shake off his beginnings even to this extent disappointing though it may be is still not to be disregarded there seems to be a conspiracy in this country to degrade the honor of men sve have revered through the ages soon we will have nothing or nobody to be proud of left in our heritage being indian i feel very keenly the lack of a lerone bennett among our race capable of stating the red mans grievances as well as bennett did in his article debunking president abraham lincoln as the black mans saviour maylx some day a magazine with as

shwayder bros inc denver colorado much gilts as euony will come up with an article cxposing the mighty bureau of indian affairs as being as much of a saviour to the indians as lincohi was to the blacks mr bennetts article interested me greatly i do think he is mistaken in his statement following randall and others tliat the emancipation proclamation freed few if any slaves it is true that it freed few slaves immediately after its issuance but as the union armies moved deeper and deeper into the south inanv thousands of slaves left the plantations to become free in fact there were so many that to feed and clothe them became a great problem for the army commanders if i am not correct in this statement how can one account for tlie several hundred thousands of negroes in the union army duriug the last year or tw o of the war i also think that mr bennett dws not give enough emphasis to the effect of the emancipation proclamation in bringing about the th amendment as i read history the priklamation made tlie adoption of that amendment inevitable mr bennett recognizes that lincoln exerted all the political pressure which he enjoyed to procure the passage through congress of the amendment ironically i had to lay aside mr bennetts provocative article to hear the vice president eulogize anew the great emancipator on the occasion of the inaugural at fords theatre we in the racial studies discipline are indecrl indebted to lerone bennett for his obvious extensive research and lucid presentation of the facts that have for too long been glossetl over in our educational institutions i just finished reading was abe lincoln a white supremacist i am glad mr bennett has brought to light historical evidence to shatter the lincohi myth of the great emancipator tlie lincoln memorial in washington must have shaken to its foundation congratulations mr bennett for the sake of say subscriptions ebony is trading a great liberator to the southern white supremacists who hate his guts so that they can now add to their slanders against the negro people the greater slander that even abe lincoln believed as they do of course lincoln wasnt john brown or garrison or higginson but that is not only obvious but beside the point for it was lincoln and no one else who led the people in the great civil war to save the union w ithout which or had it failed the abolition of slavery would have been long delayed and it is in that historic context that lincoln must le appraised and judged even if all tho authorities cited in the article arc to be believed the answer to the question was abraham lincoln a hite supremacist is a firm flat no lerone bennett jrs article was abe lincoln a white supremacist was very interesting and enlightening even though i ixlieve that many american negroes realized that lincoln u as under pressurespolitical and social change to emancipate the negro the article brought forth many new and interesting facts i believe an analogy can lx made with our ijresent president he too was pressured to do things for the negro i believe that his heart is and was not in many bills advocated by him he was under pressure from society especially the negro or black community and shadowed by the seeming sincerity of his predecessor john f kennedy am writing in reference to lerone bennett jrs article was abe lincoln a white supremacist it is enlightening to learn these new facts but lets not get carried away a few years ago the russians shocked the world by digging up stalins rcmaiils and reburying him over years have passed and it really doesnt matter whether lincoln was a white supremacist or not the fact remains that the negroes were freed during lincolns administration and we should be tliankful uiiit we are free today mhs harris washington d c lerone bennett jrs was abe lincoln a white supremacist is surely one of ills most important contributions to literary art and a welcome effort toward exploding a lingering and unfortunate myth perhaps mr bennett will now turn j his sights to another president wood row wilson whose laudable deeds while i in office are not distinguished by a great concern for darkskinned americans in the first montlis of american involvement in world war i when negroes resjionded to the opportunities the times offered them or simply tried to do their duty as citizens of a nation at war the great gulf between the goals and the american reality was vividly exposed by a series of lynchings and race riots while president wilson studiouslv looked the other w av we eitony readers are fortunate indeed that such skilled writers as lerone bennett can both entertain and inform with sensible balance james browning general manager american music center inc new york n y not being a history major i cannot offer historiccdlyoricnted data to support or to contracuct lerone bennetts article on the alleged white supremacy attitude of lincxiln but knowing fallacious reasoning i do object to his citing lincoln out of context his omission of sources and unjudieious resort to the ciceronian praeteritio bennett has also failed to realize that lincoln was a politician outspokenness and bluntness on his part would have thwarted his efforts to accomplish what he did im not naive tnie lincoln was only a man and i want to read articles that demythologize and bring out the truth but lets not have any more shallow articles to deify or to slander a liistorical figure joseph m galeota washington d c as an adult i was shocked at the article on abraham lincoln by lcrone bennett jr i always thought lincoln to be against slavery completely i was always taught this now i am confused about him dont know who or uhat to believe but i would rather believe a black man lerone bennett jr than a white man because we have been deceived by the white man so much that you really cant believe him anita williams robbins it is time people knew the inith about the man who has been idolized by negro peojde for over years im only sorry that no one has printed such an article earlier before negroes made lincoln the saviour of the black man but as it is sometimes said better late lerone bennett jr has produced in his was abe lincoln a white supremist a masterpiece not only because of its trutli but because of its elegance and beauty of style this article should be published separately and in hiud cover so that its impact may be felt not merely for a month but for all time it deser es a permanent place among tlie great classics all america is in your debt and his for this magnificent and unique achievement in the fields of belles lettres and histor there is one matter surrounding the circumstances under which the emancipation proclamation was issued which was not made clear by mr mitgang of the n y times mr mitgang properly mentioned the fact thit on september lincoln issued a preliminary procliimation the date exactly one hundred days prior to january the date of the emancipation proclamation now here is the point at which mr mitgang failed through his negligence or deliberate failure to state unit the preliminary proclamation was a looday proclamation of warning to the south lincoln specifically told the south that if within this day period the south would lay down its arms and return to the fold slavery as far as he was concerned could continuea matter of whteling and dealing with the south he further stated that if within this day period the south refused to accede he would issue the proclamation the south would not accept his deal thus the emancipation proclamation january it should be abundantly clear for all to see that tliis proclamation was a phoney in relationship to any real intention on lincolns part to really free the slaves it was purely as mr bennett has so adequately stated political strategema war measure only i just lkked with rapt attention at the article in the february issue of ebony evolution of afroamerican art i deeply regret that i was not one of the many thousands of visitors who had the good fortune to see this exhibit mrs celie j tkhuv hartford conn as a young aspiring black artist i would like to say that evolution of afroamerican art feb was one of the most inspiring articles on black art realize now that black art in america has to a great extent been suppressed as a matter of fact it has been completely ignored in texts dealing with the wide spectrum of artistic endeavors nevertheless black art has blossomed chiefly because of the rapid cultural awakening of the black man and basically because black art is unique colorful soulrending and lcautiful thomas burroughs bloomington ind i was deeply perturbed when i read my country my hell by ernest cole in the iebruary issue of ebony

can live by in racist america tlie idea of conducting himself in allareas as if he in actuality had all of his rights as an american citizen is not new to the afroamerican garvey douglass and dll bois as well as many other famous afroamcricans all made tliis assumption and governed their lives and their families lives by it it seems tliat without a doubt there would not have been a martin_luther_king or an albert luthuli if these men had not followed thcse principles in their lives and actions although this idea has lxen with lis a long time it remained for you to spell it out for all afroamericans w ho are at tile crossroads between token integration and black powder simply by following the principles which you outlined in your brilliant editorial no froamerican should ever again need to jiiestion or doubt who he is or where his place is as an american citizen in america the answer is clearat the top and with the best mark me this necessary attitude will not immediately bring him a luippy and troublefree life or endear him to the millions of bigots in racist america but it will make him feel more like a man and isnt this part of the problem locis briiock

women george and when patrick henry came ont specifically against him and compared him to caesar with his brutus somebodv said treason and he said if this is treason make the most of it then look at what yont tr ing to do to hap brown and stoktdy carmichaelcalling it sedition and treason and saying il thre isnt a law against them tlure should be then you want to turn around and tell the world that these men couldnt speak like this if they didn t ha e freedom of speech if they li ed in hussia what would happen to them yet what you are saying when you say a law should be passed against these men is that hussia in fact has the right ideaand youd bettt catch up with hussia and pass a law against these men so they cannot tell the truth then there is a freedom school in tennessee which von want to say is teaching hatred because it tells black people that your ancestors brought us over on the good ship jesus you raped our women you mutilated our men you took away our dignity and our manhood ny vestige of a culture religion or language you took away from us you can uiuu rstand whv jews who were burned bv the nazis hate germans but you cant undtstand why black people who hac been systematically murdered by the government and its agentsby private citizt ns by the police departmentyou cant understand why they hate white people and ou know hat you want to do and again we are learning all this in school about how you reacted to the way people have done s oubecause in vour background and historv von have a hevolution of which you are very proud you celebrate july th as independence day because you stood up against the british emiirc and told them to go to hell your ancestors committed treason and on celebrate it now and you were not treated nearly as badly as black people in this country as malcolm_x said we re catching more hell than patrick henrv eer saw or thought of patrick ihany woukhit hae ben abb to take it you can understand patrick henrv and make a hero out of him to me in school but then voure going to turn around and condemn ns when we use peaceable methods like father groppi and other indiiduals to gt the rights that our constitution promised us i didnt sav being born or naturalized in this countrv was enough to make me a citizen you said it the bill of bights is yours the civil_rights bills are your bills when the go ernment itself violates the law it brings the whole law into contempt a polict man is an object of contempt a policeman is a paid and hired murderer nd you nencr find the polictman guilty of a crime no matter what violence he commits against a black person in detroit you were shooting snipers so you mounted a caliber machine gun on a tank and shot into an apartment and killed a fouryearold sniper yet you have the mafia setting up headquarters outside of cicero illinoiswhere the black people are not good enough to liveand taking out a charter of incorporation in delaware and you dont bring tanks and machine guns against the mafia the justice department leases some of its offices from the mafia and you want to talk about respect for the law in history they teach me how great teddy roosc elt was yet when he wanted a certain canal builtand he didnt have the authority based on the way the laws are constiucted in this countryyou know what teddy roosevelt said damn the law build the canal they taught me that in a white school and they taught me that thomas jefferson was a hero and a patriot because he wrote all men are created equal and thomas jefferson was a slaveholder and you want to teach my child that this man who would have enslaved him had he been alive in those davs is a hero to him patrick henry who talktd about freedom being so great that he would rather take death than enslavement was a slaveholder himself then george washingtonthe presidentfirst in war first in peace first in the hearts of his countrymen was a slaveholder and you want to teach my child that these are great men tlien abraham lincoln one of the most pious hypocrites of all timeand you can read from his own words where he said he had doubts whether black men were as well endowed as white people here is the only thing he would grant the black man the right to eat the food that his hands produced he was against slavery morally but he said since he was the president officially there was nothing he could do except what would benefit the union and his wanting to do what benefited the union prevented him from carrying out what he many stated felt was his moral responsibility then you want to tell me about morality operating in this countrythe last stronghold of freedom the free worldthe statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your hungry those yearning to be free and a black man who fought in every conflict that this country ever had that this country ever hadthe first blood spilled from the body of crispus attucks during the american revolution now i want to draw a parallel between what happened at the socalled boston massacre on boston common and what we do dow here was captain preston with a detachment of british soldiers and they had a right to be there because this was a colony but the colonists felt oppressed because boston was being occupied by a foreign force so some of the citizens got together they didnt just sing we shall overcome they didnt ask the soldiers can we sit down here and pray to our god they got slabs of stone and snowballs and clubs and attacked the soldiers when the soldiers fired into the crowd and killed seven people the americans called it a massacre and they say that was a great patriotic action by those people yet black people doing ordinary reasonable peaceful things in this country are attacked by the police and the police are praised for it and you talk about giving the police more money and more power you have got them as walking arsenals nowpistols guns clubs saps some of them carry knives cattle prods the new tear gas canister highpowered rifles they will be giving them hand grenades next they can call in tanks with caliber machine gunsin the united states of america in when you are raising hell in vietnam killing people and cant straighten out whats happening in this country dont wonder why i would tell a black boy dont fight for this racist countryand it is a racist countrv they use the term nigger on the floor of congress and look at senator doddgood old christian senator dodd and then old black adam clayton powell dodd had more charges against him than you can shake a stick at and in black and white from his own documents what he had done and you people sat around debating whether we are going to censure him or whether we are to reprimand him you didnt talk about taking away his seniority you didnt talk about unseating him none of these things then here is adam clayton powell where the charges are very nebulous and uncertain but the problem is that he was a black man vith too much power and he was uppity and he acted just like you hav e always acted he arrogantly smoked his cigar which you couldnt stand so you kick him out and say he is a bad man for us then we look at senator dodd and you know what dodd said im sorry im the first one but the reason i am is they havent checked all your files then long in the senate stood and said he is lcre and were not because they exposed what is in his filesimplying that every senator is a thief e ery senator misuses public funds then the same scoundrels are going to get up and talk to me about lawlessness in the streets and far more lawlessness is perpetrated in the halls of congress than anywhere else and do you know why i think they voted against the rat control bill it fits right in with what senator long said tlie first victims may have been sitting in the senate chambers that is where the rats are but then lets make it literal rats they fear black people more than they do the bubonic plague and other diseases that rats carry because they wouldnt appropriate million to control rats but you will appropriate all kinds of money to give the national guard increased training in how to wipe us out and its a funny thing that in all these socalled riots the jwlice and national guard kill far more people than the socalled rioters and as for the sniping dont yon believe that if all of you were sitting in this room i could just shoot at random and i would hit somebody why are no cops killed they ought to be killed i think the cops should be killed i believe the national guard should be fought like they are telling us we should fight in vietnam when a man comes into my community and he is going to endanger the life of my wife and my children he should die and if it is within my power i will kill him we are tired of sitting aioiind with white people saying we have to die for what vve believe we have been dying ever since we have been in this country for what you believe and what you have taught us you know what youre going to tell your kid george washington patrick henry the great patriotsbenjamin franklin discovered that lightning and electricity are svmonymous everybody who ever did anything is white here is what you are going to give my child i am going to send him to school and teach him to respect authority so here is a cracker teacher standing in front of my child making him listen to little black sambo see thats the image the school giv es him when hes young to teach him his place a caricature wearing outlandish clothing that ev en the animals in the forest dont want to wear his name is sambo his mothers name is mumbo and his fathers name is jumbo what arc you telling him about fainilv ties in america that child does not have the same last name as either one of his parents since his parents have different last names they are not ev en married ml right so he goes through the caricature like i did when i was a small child in grade school and i dont forget these things i wasnt born from the womb with the attitudes i have now they were put in me by crackers i sat through little black sambo and since i was the onlv black face in the room i became little black sambo if my parents had taught me bad names to call the little cracker kidsand i use that term on purpose to trv to get a message across to youyou dont like it well how do you think we feel when an adult is going to take our child we teach our child to respect that adult and tliat adult gives these little white kids bad names to call him why dont you have little cracker bohunk little cracker dago little cracker kike you cant stand that but yet youre going to take our little black children and expose them to this kind of ridicule then not understand why we dont like it all riiht he gets a little older so he can t be little black sambo because hes too old for that so you turn to good old mark twain one of your great writers and the black child grows from little black sambo into nigger jim and the white kids read this stuif and they laugh at the black child and hes got to sit there and take it he is required to attend these schools by law and this is what he gets all right after he is nigger jim he goes to high school and reads emperor jones written by eugene oneill who they are taught is a great playwright and not only do they have to read it silently and master it theyve got to come to school and discuss orally about the bush niggers but still nothing about kikes and nothing about dagos and spiks and wetbacks and bohunks and wops and then after he has passed through these degrading ages of the black man and they hae whipped the spirit out of himafter thev inue made him feel hes not fit to walk the earth and he alw ays has to apologize to you for being here then they crown him they say im going to tell you what your granddaddy had been what your daddy had been what you are going to be old black joe and you know how old black joe comes avith his head hanging low aou tell us what you want to do to us and make of us and this is the educational process which our children go through and you wonder why they dont want to sit up in school and there is brutality in omaha schools a junior high school teacher had beaten kicked and cut little black children ave took these children with their parents to the mayors office he would take no action so in conjunction with his human relations board directora man named homer flovd who i think is one of the sharpest human relations men in the country hes now in topeka heading the kansas human relations commissionwe went to the office of the city attorney with these parents who wanted to bring an action on behalf of their children he was shown the injuries there was a doctor named johnson who photographed the injuries and was willing to testify in court as to the extent of tliem and the treatment he gave and do you know the city attorney refused to accept the complaint and would not allow the parents to file charges against the teacher we contacted two lawyers ones name is john miller the other leo eisenstatti mention the names because they are influential in omahathev contacted various members of the omaha board of education and wc sent written copies of the complaints to each individual member of the board to each individual member of the cit council the mayor the safety director the chief of police and all of the cracker agencies which are so interested in teaching us about law and order and decency and democracy and respectand not a bit of action was taken this man was promoted from junior high to high school and he now teaches in south high school what do you think of that a teacher wtote fk on a piece of paper and showed it to my little sister who was in the fifth grade when she told me i went straight over there nd i stood in his room and i told him if he even looked w rong id beat his brains out and i meant it i went to the principal and told him the same thingthat if he did not do something about moving that man t was going to move him out of that classroom physically myself the man is gone but do you know what the principal wanted to do first put my little sister in a different fifth grade room i said how about those other children man you miss the point this monkey shouldnt be in the schools at all so the principal said then we ll move the teacher into a diflerent fifth grade room i said youd better get him out of the school altogether so hes gone at horace mann a negro junior high about two months ago my nephewthe teacher didnt know he was my nephew they dont bother my nephews or other little children who are friends of mine she didnt know he was my nephew because my sisters last name is different from mine naturally because shes married the teacher hit him on the side of the head with a wooden paddle and broke the skin and left a swelling i went to horace mann and said youre going to get rid of her or im going to do the same thing to her which she did to my nephew and they tried to defend her action but shes gone why should we have to take each individual case of brutality and handle it personally like this the school system is terrible its rotten they have incompetent teachers there is discrimination in the placement of teachers and pupils the school board just spent to complete a white high school an argument developed over whether they should put a planetarium in it yet at technical high where most of the negroes go they cant even get blackboards again i had to go personally to the board of education and tell them they had better put some blackboards in there or some of the other schools that have them are not going to have them but tech is going to have everything it needs then the blackboards found their way there some textbooks that mv little bov didnt have in his classroom this semester came there only after i made a personal visit to lothrop school where he attends and there was water leaking through the roof buckets all overand i have pictures of it with mewater running through the light fixtures dripping in the cafeteria on to the table where sandwichcs wcre being made then when i went oer to lothrop school where all this was happening the principal instead of wanting to correct this wanted to know why in the hell they didnt come to get him and let him know i was there so i told them you ask him why in the hell he doesnt come to see me he knows where i am and by the way i dont pick on people smaller than me hes about and weighs about pounds i call him the jolly white giant and i told him and the superintendent of schools he had better muzzle this white ox or he would be slaughtered you know why i dont mind telling you this stuff because you put us in jail for nothing tliis man told you what trivial and pretended causes you use to put black people in jail if i go to jail its going to be for something not like the last time about a year ago when i was standing on the steps of the barber shop where i work i looked at a cracker cop and went to jail for interfering with an officer and disturbing the peace i have a transcript of the trial with me because you dont like to believe what we tell you then you want us to respect the police help your police fight crime to do that we would have to fight the police because they with congress are the greatest perpetrators of crime in this country you know what the police are mad about relative to supreme court decisions theyre upset because the court says they have to respect the fourth amendment to the constitution and other constitutional guarantees of the peoples freedom in a socalled democratic society we are being forced by police misconduct to get together to fight the police you know when ill believe that saying we shall overcome is an effective way to fight the police when i see you send your marines your airmen and your infantrymen into vietnam led by the mormon tabernacle choirthen making a landing on the beach singing we shall overcome and fighting them with prayer books you know that kind of action is not going to work ocr there it hasnt worked anywhere it wont work here we are going to fight you people like you fight us and dont say im revealing too much because if something happens to me there are other people who will come up tliey killed malcolm_x and produced stokely and raj you kill rap he will multiply you kill stokely he will multiply now you dont know me so maybe you dont want to kill me you might just want me in jail but you get me oft the scene and ill multiply because each time you handle one of us in this way you show what you are and you show the way you have to be dealt with there are a couple of specific things i want to mention then im going to stop because i dont want to take up the time but there is discrimination in housing in omaha the mayor likes to say a negro can purchase property wherever he can afford to anywhere he wants to bob boozer plays professional basketballi dont know if any of you know him i think he plays with the chicago bulls he wanted to buy a house they refused to sell him a lot on which he can build himself a house and he makes more money than any cracker in that neighborhood so the mayor was caught here in a vice on the one hand he talks about negroes being able to buy a house anywhere he chooses in the city then he goes to the nebraska legislature to support an open housing law vliy is this necessary if we can buy anywhere we want to by the way before the legislature killed open housing they authorized the governor to use to put down riots as tliey call them in our area we cant buv a house they refused to pass legislation necessary to help relieve these tensions but they will passthey will autliorize this man and he made some threats about his little man national guardhow they are going to come into our community and do something to us when they come something is going to be waiting for them and its not singing wc shall overcome and its not playing these little footsy games we have been playing all these years let me tell you one other thing about the police setup in omaha it flows right from this open housing situation i mentioned in the legislature the paid representative of the police union is also in the legislature lie voted against open housing and yet he is still paid by the omaha police union when he did this and the officials union city aflcio refused to take corrective action negro officers withdrew from the police union and they brought forth other complaints which we had also had brought against the police department years ago when i was cochairman of the policecommunity relations council we have exhausted eveiy means of getting redress and it has not come the police murdered a black boy named eugene nesbitt a year ago he was against a fence the cop was supposed to have been chasing him his carthe tires had been shot offhit a fence a ap came up behind him and from a distance of about nine feet shot him in the back with a shotgun before the bovs body was cold the safety director came out with a public statement and said the shooting was regrettable but justified there was no inquest there was no autopsy the cop was not relieved of duty pending an investigation nothing in march of this year a negro youth was detained in the county jail fi efeettwo the following morningthere was a door frame six and a half feet high from which he was found hangingwith his belt supposedly tliere was nothing in tlie cell for him to stand on yet a youth committed suicide in county jail and again there was no investigation but a whitewash we are getting tired of having our people killed you have a national teachers corps in omaha some interns were dropped from it because the director claimed there was not enough money in the local program to keep them you know which intenis were dropped two negroes and the program is designed to function in the negro neighborhood if those negroes dont get back in the teacher corps you are not going to have a teacher corps operational in omaha and im telling you that too and im going to do everything in my power to keep that teacher corps out of our area and if they send them in anyway they send those young whites in at their own peril i have taken a long time and i guess that is just about everything ill say for now one thing more we have a mayor who is being consulted by mr robert weaver secretary of hud on a lot of things because this mayor talked in behalf of some legislation mr weaver wanted in housing and urban development now this mayor is on the board of directors of what is known as good neighbor homes there is a negro church with an uncle tom chickeneatin preacher for the pastor who is fronting for the mayors corporation they are the sponsoring agency yet the mayor is on the board of directors the mayors personal lawyer shafton represents this group and he is making that federal money which is put up for lawyers fees it is d housing and this project was built in an area that is already overcrowded and it is supposed to be for lowincome people yet the rent starts at a month that is one of the mayors interests he is also in charge of what is known as the omaha redevelopment corporation orcand i have newspaper clippings on these things if you want to see them afterwards they ha e about houses in the ghetto which they have been buying up his corporation now they have got some money under a federal program which is designed to help code enforcement and bring those houses up to standard now at first they were tricky they went into south omaha and used some of this federal money then they went into the fringe of the negro area to use some of this money nd then the third time it is called project pride they went right into the area where between and of the mayors corporation houses are located and in federal funds is being used there this same mayor asked me to rev iew his model city proposal because be needed what he called a grassroots analysis what he really needed was somebody who could make a hodgepodge look legitimate but i am going to give him just what that thing deserves it is justification for violent revolution in omaha by black people we are late if vou read the admissions of the citv of omahas application youll wonder why we uncle tom handkerchiefhead negroes in omaha havent burned that city to the ground this includes city hall and everything else they admit that they dont give us the social serv ices we dont get the welfare attention tlie buses dont give adequate service the city itself doesnt clean the streets there is inadquate garbage disposal the police are poorly trained tliey have bad antinegro attitudes all of this is presented and you know why he did it because of the promise of the possibilities of getting some federal dollars this made him admit crimes and haws and shortcomings in the city which other considerations of morality never could we hav e been try ing to bring these things to their attention for years but they wouldnt acknowledge anything before then the federal government said if you can show you have the imagination and you understand the causes of problems of the core cities you can get some money the mayor laid it all out and there it is and this is what i come from in omaha nebraska you had better be gladyou see some people there call me militant how can vou call me militant when in view of all r these things i have mentioned to you i havent started a riot havent burned a building i bavent killed a cop you are looking at somebody who is more rational than any of youor some of youbecause some of you support the war in ietnam but you wouldnt support us if we burned down omaha t he sudden tragedy caused crewmen aboard the us navy salv age vessel off the coast of spain temporarily to forget their hazardous bomb recovery mission the dangers of surfacing the atom bomb that lay beneath the sea would have to wait until chief carl m brashears life was sa ed the expert diver had been slammed to the deck by a heavy runaway steel pipe his left leg had betmi crushed and nearly ripped off and he was in imminent danger of dying from loss of blood two shipmates hurriedly cut open the wounded seamans bloodsoaked fatigues and tied tournipicts around the limb but that did not stop the profuse bleeding with the nearest hospital miles away and an hour the earliest possible time before a rescue helicopter could take the v ictim to a waiting emergency ward the end looked near for brashear even should lie miraculouslv survive that march mishap his mates reasoned he certainly vvmild be given a medical discharge such a fate would have been only slightly better than death to brashear who vears earlier had hurdled seemingly insiirmountable obstacles to beame the navvys first v negro salvage diver as it turned out even the loss of a leg could not stop chief brashears obsession with his diving career ignoring innumerable gloomy but logical predictions that he would never again go underwater brashear launched an incredible comeback today at the sea forces gigantic base in norfolk va the muscular yearold sailor handles vital diving assignments and teaches the skill to young recruits well aware of the odds he defeated brashear delights in proving his adaptability to a condition that would ha e floored an ordinary person as casually as one would change a pair of socks he balances himself on a swaying diving platform while removing a walking leg for a heavier diving model the added weight gives me the proper buoyancy and seeks only routine assistance in donning the regulation pound gear on other occasions he disappears in muddy waters wearing sguba equipment then emerges with a cocky nothingtoit grin off duty he will either spar with his old chum dick pettigrew allnavy heavyweight at norfolks servicemens gyun or playfully gangwrestle with his four sons in his comfortable bungalow in nearby suburban portsmouth in full dress brashear deceives the casual observer with a walk so near normal that only a close stare reveals the very slight bend where the artificial limb is strapped onto bis left knee more amazing he is now qualified for any type of naval duty except aviation a career serviceman since brashear was an aircraft carrier steward in the days when the navy top brass still considered men with black skins unfit for important assignments while watching a salvage teams recovery of a jet fighter that had fallen overboard near texas he decided to try for diving after overcoming a strong undercurrent of biasinspired opposition he received his salvage certification besides stateside duties brashear saw action in korea guam and hawaii over the next decade leaving each naval base with a highly satisfactory record by when he was first assigned to norfolk he had qualified as a firstclass diver at washingtons anacostia naval base and looked forward to training for master diver the pinnacle of his field but a march midair collision of two air force bombers causing a nuclear bomb to drop into the sea near spain was the start of his woes brashear was part of a recovery team detailed to the area and as warren a ryder a hospital mate who was credited with saving the divers life says it was one of those days when everything seemed to go wrong ryder remembers it was rainy visibility was poor and the wind was blowing close to miles an hour hardly ideal conditions for going on an underwater search worst was yet to come a mooring cable snapped turning a steel pipe into a deadly projectile that smashed into ghief brashear it happened so quickly brashear preparing to lower a boat off the side scarcelv had time to shove another sailor clear of the missile for which he won a medal before catching its full impact i had just gotten inside when i got an emergency signal ryder went on someone had already fashioned a tourniquet by the time i got to the chief but it wasnt effective so i tied on another and gave him the only dose of morphine we had on board brashear was losing a dangerously high juantity of blood and felt every bit of the excruciating pain brashear was transferred to the portsmouth naval hospital after four weeks in air force hospitals in spain and germany there he met adm joseph l yon the hospital administrator and doctor who saxd his naval career wellwishers ran into a brick wall of resistance when they tried to talk of reassignment or ci ilian life yon did also at first but the chief medic soon decided that if brashear refused to face such a reality he should at least be given the opportunity to trick the fates realizing brashear could not be docked without a fight doctors finally advised him that removing the crushed leg was his only hope of gaining full mobility hesitant at first brashear changed his mind when he was assured that the healing of the old limb could take up to three years and that there was no guarantee of his walking normally he decided cant stay here that long amputate it by january he later learned the naval bureau of medicine in washington would have written him off as a di er but now with admiral yon as a chief ally he had a chance to beat the deadline in october brashear won his first victory by making good a promise to abandon crutches and wheelchairs when his first artificial limb arrived then came the supreme test brashear was locked in a pressurized tank to test his reactions to simulated deep watt r conditions and taken to the norfolk base for actual dives he responded slowly but so impressively that yon sent hearty recommendations to the naval bureau of medicine complete with reports and photos as proof whom are they fooling wondered the unbelieving bureaucrats they ordered the patient to the nations capital for five days of dies and were so convinced they cleared him to return to norfolk right away having won a major battle brashear now looks forward to new conquests still planning to enter master diver school within a few years he conditions himself with hundreds of pushups trunk raises and jumps exery day the next time be announces a goal however reactions will be different there will be few doubters that the man who cracked the naval sab age di er color line and miraculously retained his status in spite of a nearfatal accident will become the worlds first onelegged master diver n ew thinking is shattering old concepts about the best ways to assure the survival of black people in america tlie old tactics of the civil_rights movement stressed nonviolent protest and legal action now many programs promote black selfhelp as a surer road to freedom thus groups emphasizing this approach arc springing up in communities across the country probably the best organized of such groups is the new yorkbased national economic growth and reconstruction organization negro which is headed by dr thomas w matthew a neurosurgeon the negro people are looking for and are receptive to a selfhelp program dr matthew says because it offers them a lasting solution because the centuries of oppression have so gravely scarred the will for selfreliance a very significant victory is needed on behalf of the concept of negro selfhelp now in its seventh year negro operated for several years as the interfaith health association a group founded by prominent businessmen clergymen and physicians including the late p m savory coowner of the harlem newspaper the amsterdam news clergyman gardner c taylor and sociologist kenneth clark it was chartered in as a nonprofit corporation with the aim of developing of the selfhelp concept among the negro people negro now employs more than people has an annual payroll of over million and has more than million in assets spokesmen say it owns and operates the following the intcrfaith hospital in queens new york acquired in it is a public servicetype general hospital with beds there is room for expansion to beds the largest single business owned by negroes in new york state the hospital has been the experimental base for negros selfhelp program the domco chemical co in jamaica long island mong the in government and private contracts the company has is one for production of a disinfectant used in vietnam for washing u s army mess gear fresh fniits and vegetables the domco textile co also in jamaica which makes most of the uniforms worn by negro employes and which has a contract with singer miriam makeba for production of dresses for her caribbean boutiques a lingerie shop turns out stylish products labeled free fasliions which are sold in such new york department stores as abraham straus alexanders and mays a paint manufacturing plant which makes all paint used in buildings and the hospital that negro owns two family apartment buildings in the bronx new york rehabilitation of the buildings was by negro s spartacus construction co a clothing manufacturing plant in pittsburgh two bus lines with vehicles in los angeles watts section another bus line blue and wliite bus co with vehicles is operated in harlem and jamaica long island always on the lookout for other acquisitions negro has adopted a guideline that a project must be not only economically sound but must fulfill a public need negros activities are financed by the sale of economic liberty bonds offered in denominations ranging from to the bonds which are sold on streets by mail and through payroll deductions mature in years and pay holiday interest of bs percent annually between thanksgiving and christmas and hanukkah celebrations they are insured by negros million in assets the first bond program in raised of which all but has been repaid a million bond program begun last june has already raised more than dr matthew explaining the decision to use the bond system says its a system that makes it absolutely inpossible for any outside force to gain control of our policies for once our bonds are bought we can do what we want with the money as long as we keep up with our commitments outside forces can affect us only by buying or not buying the bonds dr matthew a muchhonored neurosurgeon who gave up a lxayear practice to run negro says the organization has two major purposesthe building of a people and the completing of the emancipation from slavery he explains the primary function of negro is to be a developing agency it develops industry as well as social programs particularly wherever there are groups of negro people we build ourselves not by attracting another black man because he hates an enemy but we attract him by being relevant to him and his survival operating a program which admits its big brother nature the doctor believes that black people must break up the dependency complex with which their experiences in this country have burdened them the building of this complex in the doctors opinion was the result of a deliberate policy based on american economic need for a large reservoir of eheap labor though now the need is not so great the dependeney complex is still maintained by the countrys welfare systemall of which leaves the black man with little if any belief in his own capabilities dr matthew believes that this complex must be destroyed before black people can be trulv free so wary is the doctor about negro acceptance of handouts and paternalistic charity as he refers to most of the existing programs aimed at the black community that when asked if the organization would accept a million dollar grant from the ford foundation he replies we would not accept such a grant wc would not accept it because even the offering of such a grant would mean that they are not listening to or understanding the needs of the negro people rather than offering a million dollar grant they could buy a million dollars worth of our bonds behind negros philosophy is a commitment to those black people who have been completely left out of the affluent society says dr matthew we arc concemed with building the economic strength of our people our programs are geared toward improving the standard of living of the masses of black people not just the talented tenth all of our thrust is in that direction so you will find that we are not as smooth as we would be if wc took only the highly skilled dr matthew feels that black people must build up finaiicial resources which belong to them as a whole and not to any specific person or group of persons negro he says has discussed the possibility of setting up a national negro fund which will be the treasury of the negro nationour fort knox with these funds we will be able to help the people who have hangupspeople who need work yct who wont be hired by this societys regular sources of employment we recognize the importance of the dignity of working for a living for dr matthew the success of negro represents another in a list of solid achievements which have marked his growth as a student a neurosurgeon and a black leader he was born years ago in new york city where his father was a janitor in an allwhite apartment building one of nine children all of whom are now professionals he says when i was growing up i wanted to be one of three things a lawyer a science teacher or a clergyman i ended up combining them all from the bronx high school of science through specialty training in neurology and neurosurgery at the harvard medical center thomas w matthew received dozens of academic lionors he was the first black graduate of both the bronx high school of science and manhattan college at meharry medical college he was on the deans list each year as an honor student he was the first black man to be trained as a neurosurgeon in the us and the first black man to serve as director of service at a major hospital outside the harlem community he has been an instructor at the albert einstein medical college and clinical instructor at harvard and boston university medical schools he has been a staff neurosurgeon at several top hospitals and is currently a consultant neurosurgeon at four new york city hospitals and for the new york state boxing commission always actively involved in the human rights struggle dr matthew was president of the bronx youth division of the naacp when he was a teenager today he refuses to join the american medical assn because there is segregation in some ama local chapters completely dedicated to the selfhelp approach the mildlooking physician can be a formidable foe when confronted by what he feels is an unreasonable attack on one occasion flushing savings and loan assn found that out when they tried to take possession of the interfaith hospital for nonpayment of rent overnight dr matthew became a nitty gritty combatant directing his aides and nurses to barricade the hospital and block the entrance for city marshals he told his staff if you see marshals or policemen coming dont let them incall me during the stalemate dr matthew and his opponents negotiated a compromise only then after a settlement was the barricade a chicken wire fence reinforced by white baby cribs removed at other times city building inspectors have been refused entry into negro buildings while rehabilitation was in progress we will let them in when we are finished said dr matthew at the moment dr matthew is embroiled in a struggle with new york city about enfranchisement of negros buses because of an injunction the buses are not able to nin on a regular schedule instead they make gypsylike trips through harlem and queens picking up passengers where they find them and taking them where they want to go we are fighting the injunction says dr matthew but if things havent been settled by the time the weather gets warm we are going to run our buses in harlem and jamaica on regular schedules and dare the city to stop us dr matthew has strong beliefs on many things affecting the future of black people in america especially civil_rights the civil_rights movememt will eventually fail he predicts it has to fail because it only asks for equal opportunity but if the black man has only equal opportunity he wont be able to compete with non negi oes for they will ha e the adantage of the support of their group it will be the indi idual negro against another group until the negro has a strong group as a backup his equal opportunity is meaningless and ecjual opportunity is the most that civil_rights can bring to the black man our peoples need transcends civil_rights if forced to make a choice id give up civil_rights for economic freedom on black americans i believe that we are a distinct peopledistinct from africans distinct from other americans distinct from any other people on earth i have always accepted the fact that we are a nation within a nation a people with similarities based on our experiences in this country which bind us together these similarities being both cultural and biological on black_power white america can save black_power and it is in w hite americas interest to do so the black pow er worthy of saving is the only powcr negro seeks the powder of selfhelp the alternative to white america joining negro in its struggle to bring the negro people into the mainstream of american life is the black_power of defeat those whose cries and even whosc names frighten white america are shouting black_power because it is the only power left to them on laws and lawlessness there are two kinds of laws in a society laws of necessity which bind man to man and without which society would fall into chaos and laws of convenience which are laws that serve special interest groups because they have in one fonn or another enough power to bring those laws into existence tliesc laws are not vital to societys survival and society would not collapse without them when the interests of my group demands that i break the majority groups laws of convenienee then i become the lawless laws of convenience are inherently discriminatory against the interests of black people when i break them i must be prepared to pay the penalty though at times whether or not you pay tlie penalty depends upon your strength on riots riots are epidemics of erupting boils medically pain and fever trigger natural responses and under proper professional care additional drugs and treatment defeat disease it is only when pain and fever are masked by the palliative of aspirin that boils erupt on the human body similarly the palliatives of civil_rights bills token integration and an ineffective war on poverty have brought to the surface of american life the erupting boils we call riots riots are not caused by viciousness they are triggered by viciousness i cant see our people completely giving up the conceit of riots riots can be an important strategy for our people on negro leaders our leaders have tried too long to make the negro look more principled than any other group we have no obligation to do this it is a kind of backhanded racism for my black leader to assume that we are going to be any more principled than any other people we are the only group being called upon to fulfill the christianjudaism ethic in pure absolute form our leaders must also learn not to talk out of emotion but out of sheer cold factual rational calculation on malcolm_x i knew malcolm very well and often disenssed things with him malcolms great fault was that he neer had a program but i do feel he was the foremost spokesman our ieople have had to state the indictment of the oppression which we have experienced on stokely carmichael and rap browns stokoly and rap are symbols of the racial problems in this country they are spurs in the saddle they are serving the important role of being catalysts if the time comes when we no longer need this spur the negro people will put them down on the guaranteed income negroes have knowm about guaranteed annual income since we first came to this countrw our grandparents had a guaranteed annual income they called it slavery the civil_rights leader the white sociologist the liberal economist all mean us well but fate plays a cruel joke on us all the guaranteed annual income they seek for us would doom us as it has the american indian who stayed on the reserwation to an ever lower level of existence the cruelty lies in the fact that this hope they offer is but an empty dream the congress is not going to pass a guaranteed annual income and every informed observer and politician knows it norbert rillieux began life on a plantation near new orleans he was a bright child and eager to learn so his father anxious that the boy receive a good education sent him to paris rillieux quickly lived up to all expectations he published several papers on the steam engine and its economy and was soon an instructor at one of the finest paris academies his education and training behind him rillieux decided to return to the us to put his talents to use in the early s sugar was manufactured by a slow primitive method known as the jamaica train this made it an expensive luxury that only a few could afford one day rillieux ran his fingers through a small bowl of coarse brown sugar and felt sure that something could be done to make it better and cheaper so he set to work by he had developed a process that turned sugar cane juice into a finer grade of sugar at about half the cost the rillieux process was quickly adopted by cuban and mexican sugar refineries and norbert rillieux was soon the most famous engineer in the state of louisiana several years later rillieux returned to france only to find europeans completely disinterested in his new sugar process so he turned to archeology and spent ten years deciphering hieroglyphics eventually europe realized the value of the rillieux sugar process and adopted it in its refineries with renewed interest rillieux again turned to engineering this time applying his process to the sugar beet results sugar production costs were cut in half norbert rillieux did for sugar what eli whitney did for cotton we may take his invention for granted now but each teaspoon of sugar that goes

the end of the day i i leave it all behind t he first thing you notice about him is his clothes a flaming orange highcollar satin shirt toned down by a tan sixbutton doublebreasted whipcord jacket dark brown corduroy pants and brown cowboy boots then you notice that his clothes fit him well ancf that he seems a little short finally he looks back at you almost stares and says hello im flip wilson without the introduction most people would recognize the impish face of yearold clerow flip wilson one of the hottest comics on the scene today he has turned on millions via the ed sullivan show the today show and tonight show the mew griffin show the mike douglas show rowan ir martins laughino the shows that count and even some that are not so important wherever he goes he gets for an appearance often more depending upon who it is and how convenient it is to do it he has a fastselling album out cowboys ir colored people with the title alone enough to indicate flip wilsons brand of humor original refreshing hardhitting when he wants it to be subtle when necessary there is no doubt that flip wilson is a success and while hes happy about it all hes not excited i knew all of this would happen he confided between sips of orange juice before turning to his breakfast of two raw eggs and a bowl of per cent bran flakes i belieed all of this would happen its just a matter of seeing how much more of the dream is going to come true i dreamed it all i got the cookie in the dream what flip wilson is saying is that all along he knew he wanted to be a comic and a good one even when growing up in jersey city one of children of whom are still living he felt his talent would one day bring him beyond the poverty that plagued him as a child he went through a series of foster homes but he also went to school and it was there when he was nine that he made his stage debut it was in a class play wfliich nearly collapsed when the leading lady dropped out somehow flip who used to hang around the stage had memorized her lines and promptly wound up replacing her as clara barton flip mixed a little acting with school work until he was then dropped out of high school raising his age to join the air force after his discharge in he began concentrating on comedy fulltime setting for himself a yeargoal to succeed i knew it would take that much time because comedy involves so much psychology and being able to speak on all kinds of subjects youve got to read learn educate yourself you cant be come a comic overnight theres no such thing as instant success ever since he traded his first job after the service bellhop at a san francisco hotel for small comedy walkons first as a tlrunk it has been an uphill struggle all the way soon he graduated to writing all his material he found a lot of time in which to do it in he met a wealthy man in miami who recognizing his undeveloped talent gave him a week so he could have an income and free time to write his scripts throughout that time flip was appearing in clubs but it wasnt anything to brag about and virtually no one knew who he was tlien one night in comedian redd foxx appeared on johnny cansons tonight shotv and he plugged wilson after that it was a fast climb all the way carson invited wilson on his program so did ed sullivan he got bookings at new yorks bitter end and village gate and san franciscos hungry i he began appearing on other television shows and soon people throughout the country were telling each other flip wilson jokes a comic of the first order flip has always been concerned with more than laughter and he spends as much time on techniques as on lines hes so intent upon his work that hes already started a book on rules of humor i dont think im enough of an authority to publish it now he says i have years and years ahead of me to prove the value of my ideas i have to make myself a success im still compiling notes for the book many pcoplemcluding comedians who know flip also know about his book and its laws and commandments of hnmor they talk with him about it then they tell him it isnt necessary to develop comedy into such an art that one doesnt ha e to work that hard no one else that ive run into feels the depth that i go into is necessary but i feel that just having the natural ability is not enough he says he wishes he had known someone when he was coming up to whom he could have turned for advice but there was no place i could go to and be taught whats funny or about the technical aspects of presentation so he had to learn on his own starting out with a book he chanced upon one day called the laws of utnnor by max eastman soon he began cataloguing his own laws feeling that there are a lot of guys who have the natural flair for comedy and who can say funny things but theres more than that to being polished up throughout the years he has learned that a play on words a big grin a cute line and corny words are not enough delivery is important and actions count knowing when to make a little move or give a little wink or change the voice a little to make color distinctions between characters says flip he also knows routines are not necessarily created overnight two of his most ixpular monologues colored people and indians and christopher columbus take less than seven minutes to deliver they took three years to write combining practical thoughts with a wayout situation wilson talks about racial discrimination only this time its indians instead of negroes wilson who says hes never refrained from talking about anything he wants to starts out wondering should i do racial material i ask myself then i hear a voice in the back of my mind that says lighten up dammit then another voice says one more time backed with confidence he goes on why not why should i be hesitant about cxprcssing my opinion ladies and gentlemen why shouldnt say to yon weve got to do something aloiit the indians the indians arent ready yet now quite often when i say that people feel its a harsh statement but how harsh it is deiends on how you look at it now lets ask ourselves this question do you want to build a liouse and then have an indian build a wigw am next door when he goes back in time to david and goliath wilson remembers that little david was the first great singer of all time remember little daxid he asks i bet goliath remembits he then explains that the famous battle was really fought because david was such a popular singer and such a hit wdth all the girls miere er daid appeared all the girls would come and crowd around in front of the stage and say play on that harp little david play on that harp honey what you say go on little da id nd flip goes on sounding so good and so colored according to flip david was the ray charles of his day and he put out three albums david jams part i david jams part ii and his greatest hit jam david in his latest album flip bas another story which took him a long time to wtite he spent nearly two and a half years waiting his w orst story one that breaks as many of the laws of humor as possible without completely destroying the effect of the story he maintains he w rote the story to reinforce his popularity e noticd quite often when an audience would leave a show not necessarily in my case they wall not remember the guys name but they will remember bis worst story and since it should be the objective of every entertainer to give the audience something to reiikmiiber him by ive wtitten a bad story the scene of the joke is ancient rome where the fad is eating berries and the hero is roman herman its a good story i know it is but its a bad story as far as construction not all of flips stories take years to write his latest album also includes a story wdiich took the least time to write and is proving to be one of his most effective its all about the black knights now no one can question flip says confidently that during the days of the knights there must hae been black knights he then tells about a major rescue of a damsel in distress by the one and only overnight with all of his material flip builds in laughter his jolces are generally clean although he doesnt hesitate to use the words ass damn or hell i neer go beyond any of those all of which you find in the bible so it aint gonna be any great infraction of anyones morals to use them of course thats the extent go to but i dont sec anything shocking about those words his subject matter is more relevant than contro ersial and he doesnt hesitate to talk about ugly people midgets and his riot suit while there are many variations flip basically tells two kinds of jokes practical and ludicrous and sometimes a combination of both some are preposterous right from the start like his very popular christopher columbus joke in which chris is greeted by colored folks upoui landing in america the audience knows right away that its an absurd situation and it constantly builds and they laugh all through the story you build it to a whirl and you keep it there he also likes to talk about his shortest practical joke confidential survey the story starts in a very modest area where a fellow driv es up pulls up to a house walks out and knocks at the door a man answers flip explains good afternoon sir im conducting a confidential survey and i would like to inquire as to whether your vvife would object to your daughter marrying a negro the fellow tells him that his wife is upstairs and if he waits a moment hell ask her he says ethel would you mind if our daughter marries a negro and she answers with that toiieh of sapphireshe can marry anybody slu tcont when he does that situation in a club flip says right away the audience is up tight itccause the subject is v ery delicate for ev eryone they can be laughing all along but right away they say wow hes getting ready to really mess up and then boom like the release valve they hear the end and sav damn that makes sense flip comments on anything he wants to hut i dont just go to it because i feel somebody expects me to i talk about what i want to and it becomes my sense of humor what i think is funny im not going to let anybody type me or make any demands nor is he going to be pushed into ethnic humor he feels comedy can have a message but it cant overpower the humor he cites his indians routines as showing that the message could still be there but the accent has to be placed most on the humor by using the indians he shows how racial discriminatioti can be turned around to relate to anvonc not necessarily just negroes and whites tliis time it s between other races but the message is still there flips trick however is to make the audience laugh first at the ludicrous situation of the indians being discriminated against by negroes but wlien they finish laughing on their way home in the car theyll think of what they laughed at many of flips jokes have no message theyre just funny but they all show the marks of a professional entertainer the last thing flip wants to be is an authority on negro humor he was recently inited to participate in a twoday symposium on negro humor at a western university and declined i dont know anything about negro humor im telling you what i think is funny about a particular situation my brand of humor which can include negro humor this is my culture but its not limited to it a friend who has known flip for some years sums him up in four wordsfunnv all the time een when he starts off serious he often winds up laughing while in new york taping several specials and making guest appearances he stayed in a hotel where he could swim e ery day but he was juick to assert i cant swim on top of the water i shouldnt have to explain that any further fish are like that tooor a porkieor one of them kind that they drop in the bread crumbs and put in the deep grease they dont even come up for air it is contemporary wit in action or he might tell you about perfumes and colognes and how every night the bunnies would run up and sniff me to see how i smell flip says he always mixes the scents keep trung to surprise them you can never let anyone know where youre at once they know where youre at the mystery is gone so youve got to keep throwing them off whipping a new odor on them all the time i think next week im going to surprise them and not put anything on flip wilson through his jokes reveals a philosophy of life flip can be very funny he can also be dead serious especially when hes talking about education which he considers as important as comedy if not more so im a dropout i alue education very much if violence indicates masculinity i dont want to sound any less masculine but i dont think there is anytliing so serious that people cant sit down and discuss it violence is the tool of the ignorant to avoid violence weve got to ha e more education he hopes one day to set up a scholarship fund to send people to college maybe then wlien they come out they can repay that and their money will send other people to college education is the thing more than anything else its certain that flip a divorce will not allow his four young children to drop out on either education or society if he hadnt been a comic flip would probably have been a criminal lawyer because he believes he would love the challenge of life or death of working with a juiy but he has no intention of switching in midstream he secs comedy as his unlimited horizon where he can really add something i feel ive already added to it and theres so much more that i can add and why shouldnt he after all anybody who at the age of six earned a reputation for improvising songs and poems while awaiting the daily pledge of allegiance was not without creative urge now a superstar among the satirists flip shows promise that he will be around for some time to comeprobably much longer than that tan sixbutton doublebreasted whipcord jacket he wears so wcll as he goes on there seems to be little chance that flip wilson will become conceited he is too practical to get caught in selfadulation if you really put yourself into something you can make it but you cant make it on a lot of bs not for long thats it just an honest days work for an honest days wages but there is more to flip wilson than that hes good hes a hit and hes about to give a new dimension to comedy a funny thing happened to sgt robert dance on his way to becoming a second lieutenant he rotted rot rot rot thats all a plebe in the philippine military academy docs laughs dance the term rot is basic academy argot the cadets use it to describe the traditionally rough and not always humorous life of a plebe freshman at the academy high in the mountains near the philippine resort city of baguio recalling his freshman year at the academy dance observes that a plebe nexer does anything right as far as upperclassmen are concerned he remembers the first time he sat down to boodle cadet tenn for eating at the academy i dont drink coffee and i pushed it away somebody asked mr dance is there something wrong with our coffee no sir i answered vmiy then are you not drinking our coffee dumbguard dance does not drink coffee sir i said to the upperclassman who told you you could refuse you start drinking he ordered so i drink coffee but dancing to the tune of upperclassmen has long heen history for dance he graduated from the academy in march and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the u s army only five americans had attended the philippine institution before danceand all of tliem were white after serving two years in the u s army as an enlisted man dance passed the examinations that cpialified him for entrance into the u s military academy at west point however when offered the chance to go to the philippine academy as an exchange student he accepted it was an honor to qualify for west point says the yearold kentucky natixe but the chance to attend a foreign academy was an even bigger opportunity so xvith packed duffel bag he xvas off to a location xvhere the mountainsalmost a mile aboxe sea levelrise higher than in kentucky he placed first on the schools stiff entrance exam and the rotting began s tateside military academies says dance have nothing on the philippine military academy as far as academics are concerned it is an opinion the young cadet shares with col george orton an exchange professor at the philippine academy from the u s air force academy in boulder colo the philippine academy patterned after the us military cademy at west point was founded in japanese occupation of the philippines during world war ii forced the academy to close but the academy reopened in a year after philippine independence was proclaimed enrollment now numbers some k students of the five americans who preceded dance as exchange students at the academy three stayed through graduation graduates take bachelor degrees in science after a fouryear course that emphasizes engineering the road to a military future is not an easy one admits dance typical day in a cadets life calls for rising at am making formation attending three or four classes making formation again passing inspection studyingstill another formationand finally sacking out at pm such a schedule is maintained six days a week throughout the year the closest thing to a summer vacation for cadets is tactical training in the field and in the mountains looking back however dance is convinced that it all pays off look at a cadet standing beside somebody on the outside he says and you can tell hes dilferent w hether they suffer shin splints pulled muscles or just a case of presprint jitters many athletes on the u s team will have more than one occasion to call on help from tennessee a is athletic trainer buddy taylor when the olympics get under way in mexico city this fall out of the grinding competition between the worlds best amateur athletes will come much physical wear and tearmuscle kinks blisters sprains and a profusion of scraped knees and elbows as a member of the eightman olympic training squad taylors task will be to help keep u s athletes in the best physical condition for winning gold medals taylor is well equipped to handle the job at he is a year eteran of his profession in the drawl and twang of his native richmond va taylor explains that training athletes simply means doing everything possible to keep them ready for competition to both coaches and team pi ysicians the trainer is an advisor and an aide to the athletes he is a combination medicine man mother hen close friend confidant and psychologist tavlor recalls one sundav afternoon last vear at the mexico city little olympics when a famous dash star stumbled into the training compound wdiimpering about a mysterious ailment wdiich he felt would cut his chances for placing in a meter qualifying heat quickly diagnosing the ailmnt as a case of the jitters buddy coaxed the cinderman on er to his training table where he administered a massage and a vapor rub he talked some too in a folksy lexicon of verse that by now is a buddy taylor trademark sample remember baby the goose hangs loose refreshed and instilled with new selfconfidence the young star went out on the track to win the heat he also snatched first place in the main race the next day but only after returning to taylors training room for more of the same treatment w hen trainer buddy taylor first got word of his olympic appointment early last year he was overjoyed still am says buddy it s the greatest thing that has happened in my career the highest iionor a man in my profession can receive but honors are only stepping stones to buddy after the appointment he went to work to fulfill a lifetime dreamtliat of becoming a baseball trainer for a professional hall club put feelers resumes and phone calls out in a lot of places says buddy who is currently wooing the kansas city athletics in a letter writing campaign to influentials of the sports world taylor spelled out his qualifications and his goals one of the first to respond was boston herald traveler columnist al hirshberg who wrote i never heard of anyone trying to get a job as a big league trainer by correspondence but i guess buddy taylor has no alternative you see buddy taylor is a negro hirshberg continued the only negroes ball clubs look for are ballplayers though he knows about such problems taylor is war about making enemies and stays mute on the subject of bias in sports tm too busy trung for crying but hirshbergs observations that no major league trainer has qualifications half as impressive as taylors could be true since he first came to a i in taylor has trained more olympic medal winners than any trainer in the nation the list of track stars includes ralph boston edith mcguire and wyomia tyus taylor has worked with cagers and a score of better knoti grid men like steelboned israel lang of the philadelphia eagles and bill tucker of the san francisco ers both men are a i alumni taylors professional career began in when he worked for the semipro richmond rams football team for a year he moonlighted for a pro team the richmond rebels wtien buddy entered the u s army in he wound up with the job of post trainer at ft campbell ky at discharge time in he enrolled in the chicago college of swedish massage and later studied health and physical education at morgan state college in baltimore in vs buddy was graduated with a masters degree in professional athletic training from indiana university then packed up for richmond va and a job as trainer at virginia union university where he staved until an offer came from a i d d hes an extremely dedicated man of great versatility says fred zip brooks an extrainer and personal friend brooks who remembers hiring buddy for the rebels years ago recalls that he buddy worked so hard as a volunteer we had to oflfer him a salary later with the experience and the prestige of a book taylor coauthored on the subject of training to be released later this year by lea and febiger philadelphia brooks feels that buddy taylor would have reached the big leagues long ago were it not for the color of his skin but in the style thats characteristic of his perennial optimism buddy slirugs the game is tough but ive got my stuff now something has to break right suppose you arc woiicloring what can mahalia say tliat will help other woineii in matters of the heart who have twice tried to find marital bliss and who for years lived the illusion of single blessedness you ask what does a gospel singer who has won international acclaim lives in a beautiful home and has money in the bank know of heart ache and loneliness it is because of my failure to find happiness that presume to ad ise others especially older career women who find theinsehes in the predicaments ha e faccd perhaps what i hae learned through painful experiences will spare them the mistakes that i hav e made for this reason and this reason only i am willing to bare my heart exposing the hurt that is still tliere both of my nentures into matrimony ended in divorce one because married a weak man who loved me as i was and the other because i married a strong man who loed me for what i was and what i could do for him but how can any woman tell when a man is weak or when he is sincere or when he is truly in love with her judging a man there are no formidas no foolproof steps to follows no glass balls to gaze into that reveal how a man wull behave once he has walked dow n that aisle especially if the bride is a notsoyoung but obviously successful woman so when she has more to lose materially by marrx ing than she has to gain she should try every test watch for every sign that mijht bring out his true feelings for her and reveal his real character usually when a woman meets a man and becomes interested in him and he shows an interest in hershe talks to him as though she was starting out in life with nothing nd most negro women do if he has little to show for his years of manhood and she wants to respect him she does not begin their relationship with talk about money she talks about the things he likes and likes to do in this way she tries to find out if he has high ideals and principles sometimes friends will give her a clue by the way they react when they see her wnth him if they disapprove of him their eyes will give her one of those signs like watch out or they may give her one of those looks that says he likes you hes a fine man the opinions of others are not akvays reliable but when friends say something good about the man she likes it makes a woman feel that she is taking the right step of course no matter what folks say ir liow they signify if a woman feels strongly about a man strong enough to invite him to go through life wnth her she truly does not want to hear what any other w oman thinks about him she just might be envious some women who find fault if given an opportunity would endure this man no matter what he did because my recent marriage was such a surprise to the public and because few people knew the man many thought that i purposely kept my intentions a secret for fear that those close to me would disapprove that was not the case i had known my husband for tvo years knew his family longerbut did not want to say anything until i had definitely made up my mind to remarry to tell the truth i did not know i was going to marry so quickly myself i took the opinions of others and my owm feelings under consideration and said to myself misery loes company im tired of being miserable so im going to marry and be happy physical attraction not i n fact i was attracted to my husband because i was happy when was in his company he seemed to ha e an abundant love for life when we were together i felt like i didnt have a care in the wwld we would spend the day just going to little inepensi c places together and i didnt mind that at all he loved to hike and i loved nature too we seemed to enjoy each other but this very thing that i loved in him his gayety and his zest for living became an obsession with him after we were man ied he wanted second husband mintors signuuul galloway jo works on arrangement he was reed man with combos working in howok studios before marriage miss jackson partly blames his musical ambitions for breakup of threeyear marriage in to go some place every night but i wasnt used to that my body had to ha e rest i travelled to singing engagements by car in order to save money so that i would have something wdien my fame was over and i was tired besides as a church woman i couldnt afford to be seen in the wtong ein ironments so a woman should be careful not to lean too heavily on a mans physical attractions or she may find herself hoping with all her htart that he is what she dreamed he would be she must not be so blinded by his good looks his sophisticated ways and his fine manners that she shuts her eyes to all of his other traits she must not be so hungry for love that she sees in a man only that which is good and finds herself making excuses for that which is not will it last my new husband and i both liked music we were both baptists and he came from a fine church family i knew that he loved to play golf and bowl and go to the theater things i did not do but at first i let myself think that by him being an educated man this was his happiness i thought this was the way his kind lives i did not wmnt to take this happiness away from him but even when looking at a man through lo ecolored glasses a woinanespecially an older woman has her time of doubt i had mine i prayed about it but there was this feeling in me that i could not understand the closer i got to marriage the heavier the burden around my heart became why i dont know but i think i was worried about what my family would think and what my public would say i have a lot of respect for the opinions of my relatives my public sort of leans on me expects me to communicate with god for what it wants the public is a funny thing people like to feel that you belong to them that you should sacrifice your personal desires to be free to help others many letters that i received after the wedding indicated that they thought my being married would interfere wutb my charitable and religious work most of the letters expressed disapproval hundreds of those who wrote to me thought i had married a white man after seeing our pictures in the papers and magazines people would say to me oh your husband is white i told them no me being as black as i am made him look whiter than he is they just didnt want me to marry especially the ministers who had always been free to come to my house they fearedand rightly so that a husband would put a stop to all of that they would no longer be able to say mahalia cook me something to eat mabalia come to my church and do this that or the other ivc been such a servant to the people that they felt privileged to analyze my husband and pass judgment on him feeding the male ego w hen a woman marries a man with a big ego a man with a desire to accomplish great thingsand hasnt hut the woman hashe becomes frustrated he begins to belittle her talents and to boost his own if he is more educated than she he may try to make her feel insignificant and insecure suddenly she is unable to speak for herself he assumes or to take care of the husiness or career she built mv husband couldnt understand how i could draw such crowds with the type of songs i sing he wanted me to help him to advance his musical career and i tried by introducing him to important people and getting my recording company to make a record for him but when a mans talent has not brought him as much acclaim as the talent of his wife he should not minimize her proven gift one that has brought her worldwide renownespecially if he is living in luxury off of the resources her gift produced these are some of the things a woman discovers after the tinsel of new love hegins to lose its luster often a mans inner self does not measure up to this outward appearance which attracted her to him the composer turns out to be a sometime jazz musician without a job those recreational habits and cultural pursuits now so necessary to his needs become a liability to her bank account their marriage license belatedly rcn cals that he is six years her junior she discovers that they live in two different worlds she begins to remember other things things he said and did before they were married which should have warned her but as i say when a woman is past and lonesome she throws back a lot of signals that she should have paid attention to were she not so starved for love i say to any woman heed the warnings if a man gives her cause to doubt him cause to be suspicious of his motives think about it and try to analyze his actions before going into a thing as serious as matrimony it only took seven minutes for me to get married but it took nearly a year to untie that knot i am still trying to mend the damage t wo months after our marriage when we should have been on our honeymoon i was in the hospital suffering from a heart attack he was unhappy and i was sick i had made a mistake but i did not want people to know that i had made such a fool of myself i felt the ibrations of my friends and could tell who did not like what was happening to me but i never said a word just tried to make a go of it that terrible heaviness i had felt was gods warning if i had only prayed more i told myself he would have let me figure this thing out but i tried to go along i thought perhaps my husband would change tlien i began to blame myself for being too hard on him and i tossed with that i let a lot of things go by like criticism of my diction being corrected while i was being interviewed by the press i am not an educated woman im just myself and the world has accepted me as am i speak the way i feel inside and thats it through travel i have acquired a lot of knowledge i could have answered back but i did not want to start an argument i wanted to keep my husband and make a home reluctant to let the public know how foolish i had been i kept all of my troubles inside of meand lost my healtli during those two years of marriage i was in and out of hospitals about a dozen times the doctors said there wasnt anything wrong with me but i got to feeling sorry for myself and took refuge in my illness i havent worked regularly since the year was wed i even saw a psychiatrist but he said i was as sound as the dollar he slapped on the back of his hand have weighed as much as pounds but during the long divorce trial i went down to a mere skeleton of my former self they say a man must have his dream so a woman tries to make his dream come true to get along with him she supports his ideas and encourages his ambitions and gi es in to his desires but for some men that is not enough when success does not fast enough they blame their wi es i married two educated men imt im always the pauper my first husband loved me dearly he was a chemist but what kind of job could a negro chemist get in those days so he turned to gambling that is the way he made his living i was brought up in the church and i did not want that gambling money he gave me love but maybe my love was not strong enough to help him to ov ercome his weakness oh he made money but he lost more than we both could earn we were poor in those days in one room i was straightening hair and in the other room i was living with rats and roaches chinches were running all over me oh tve been through hell that was about years ago my first husband has never remarried he savs that he has never loved another woman and he has neer stopped playing the horses that is his life he is a grown man and he has a right to live as he sees fit i have always tried to save a penny today so that i can live tomorrow now that i am older and have made two mistakes i would advise a woman not to live extravagantly but to get out of life the best that she can every day because tomorrow is not promised us love is everything love is the only thing that i dont have and that is the most important thing in a womans life if she hasnt money or fame and she has love she has everything love gives her peace of mind it gives her something with which she can face the world and fight the world and stand up under when all else fails love is like the rock of gibraltar but a career is a limited thing there will always be new inventions to replace it when it ends a woman will find that her life has been empty a career no matter how great can never take the place of love it is true that marriage does not always assure a woman love or even companionship infatuation so similar to love is sometimes confused with it but real love enables a couple to remain together through j times of trouble and still have respect for each other real love cannot be destroyed by friends a true friend will not worry a woman with what she may knowor think she knowsabout the womans husband a tnie friend wants to see the couple stay together she will only interfere to avert what she believes will be a tragedy no one likes to be told things that hurt their pride but people came to me and told me what they heard and what they thought did not appreciate it but they told me to my face that my husband didnt mean me any good not only my friends but strangers downtown spoke their minds one day when i was shopping in the merchandise mart i couldnt find anything because a clerk was so concerned about my divorce mahalia she began loud enough for everybody to hear that nogood husband of yours thats the way people do they recognize me from television and the papers and they just walk up and talk to me tliey play my records and hear me sing the spirituals and they feel they can say anything to me what comes up comes out when they think about me people were reading about the divorce then and they were so angry they called my husband all kinds of slick cats when my divorce was finally granted everybody seemed to rejoice the friends who were made unwelcome at my door are coming back now last christmas my house was like old times the winter before i lived for three months in hotels and motels and with relatives while my husband occupied my beautiful home tlie judge would not put him out because under illinois law it was his liome too as long as we were married so last christmas the house was decorated from roof top to the shrubbery around it and i killed the fatted lamb my lamb was two turkeys ten ducks and a whole roast pig i didnt inv ite anybody i didnt have to mahalia was home and people came the wedded bliss is over and i am back with single blessedness i may not have the love of a good man but gods great love is always with me i have my career to continue and i have the mahalia jackson foundation through which i can do something constructive for others for seven years i have been working alone to help new talent help mothers unable to do for their children and children unable to do for themselves there can be no more ignorant people like me my people must be educated if they are to make it in todays world so now i am asking others to help me carry on this work somewhere there must be another pearl bailey and another marian anderson each better tlian the first who needs to come forth somewhere there must be another mahalia one better than me through my foundation i will find them and they i hoie will find love dentistry has loni been a profession dominated by men and in the past lliere was good reason before the appearance of selfcooling drills and painkilling drugs a dentist needed strength as well as skill but now that dentistry employs the latest methods and equipment there is no reason why women cannot integrate the masculine ranks of the profession at least this is the opinion of dr jeanne sinkford mother of two and a fulltime dental educator as associate dean of howard universitys college of dentistry and the first woman to hold such a position she plans to make the dental profession more attractive for both men and women dr sinkford claims that dentistry can be a lucrative field for women yet today they comprise less than one per cent of the nations dentists she is not alone in her conviction that more women could compete in the profession the dean of howards college of dentistry dr joseph heniy says technological advances have made brain power more important than ihysical strength a womans light touch is actually best with modern equipment a s a woman and as a professional jeanne sinkford must handle five fulltime jobsthe associate deans position at the dental school head of the irosthodontics department coordinator of the interdepartmental research program mother to her tvvo children dianne and janet and wife to dr stanley sinkford assistant professor of pediatrics at howard because she has a family and a growing career to manage she must strictly budget her time in order to do each of these jobs well she faced many hurdles in her pursuit of a dentistry career not the least of which was the problem of direct competition with men it takes a lot for a woman to be in a top position particularly in a male profession she explains you have to be better to be accepted as equal once your colleagues accept you as a competent person they dont mind your being there but men are resentful at first because they feel a woman has been selected for a position they might ha e taken as a girl jeanne had no ambition to compete with men instead she hoped to don the tutu of a prima ballerina eight years of ballet instruction in washington led to a scholarship offer for extended training in new york city but jeannes artistic ambitions ended with a firm parental no when she told them of her plans to quit high school and leav e for new york fortunately in addition to her dancing talent jeanne had an interest in science so after enrolling at howard she majored in psychology and chemistry a budding romance livened the hours between technical courses and during her junior year she married a yoiuig medical student stanley m sinkford when she finally earned her undergraduate diploma the next year careerminded jeanne faced a dilemma although she was interested in medicine she spurned medical school fearing that she would be forced to compete with her husband she considered graduate work in psychology or dental hygiene but her family dentist cxjiiv inced her that she had the perfect background for dentistry with a scholarship from howard dental school she proved to herself that a woman

new orleans to nashville as southern school boards attempted to follow the direction of the supreme court after the school decision which ruled that separate education is unequal education but today the locale has been changed the women who picketed a group of seven negro children who integrated the iount greenwood elementary school in chicago in februaiy top opposite page have much in common with the women of new orleans bottom opposite page who shouted derisive remarks at a lone negro integrating frantz school in november the negro children in chicago had transferred to previously all white mount greenwood school under a permissive transfer plan that allows negro or white children in overcrowded schools to transfer to underpopulated schools nearby with their parents providing the necessary transportation a sympton of sickness he continuing violent opposition to integration of schools is a symptom of the deeprunning racism that afflicts so many white americans today many of the more conseiwative whites who profess not to be racists believe that the solution to the race problem is education the negro needs education in order to take his place as an equal citizen today they will say glibly it will take time you should not try to rush it too fast at the same time these conservative whites will fight integration of the schools particularly in the lower grades actually they do not believe that education is the answer deep down in their hearts they believe that the negro is naturallv inferior to the white man and thev fear that if white and negro children are educated together from kindergarten through high school the white children may not see this inferiority and may consider the races so equal that they will not grow up with a builtin anathema against intermarriage from the top down ooking back over the last years it is easy to see that the entire problem of school segregation was attacked exactly backwards in the mids court battles were fought to get negroes admitted to graduate schools in the south wlien that battle was won the fight went next to undergraduates in colleges then to high schools and last of all elementary schools the fight was from the top down instead of from the bottom up the federal government should have enforced integration from the bottom upstarting with the tots in kindergarten had this been done the young adult of today both north and south both negro and white might hae a better understanding of his fellow american and there might not be quite the likelihood of the violence in the streets which all america seems to be expecting this summer too little too late ctuallv the conservative whites who said that the negro needed education in order to earn equality were right years ago and they should have seen that the negro was given not only an equal education then but also equal treatment in world war h equal job opportunities after the war and equal consideration under the law during the past two generations if that had been done the united states today would be in much better condition both economically and socially foreign powers could not point their fingers at the one big flaw in this socalled democracy and we might not even be involved in an endless war in vietnam which is draining our resources and holding this country up to scorn in the majority of the worlds nations the late s and early s when the free world was united in a battle against a racist adolf hitler would have been the ideal time for the united states to start cleaning up her own house instead she waited until almost the wars end to integrate the armed forces and civilian discrimination and segregation were allowed to grow even worse than before the attempted changes of the past years hav e come too little and too late is there still time he question which the people of the u s must answer today is is there still time there are two segments of the population vviiich have made up their minds the extreme black nationalists and the extreme white supremacists both say no time has run out tliey arc looking forward to a blood bath which the white supremacists seem sure that they will win and the black nationalists admitting the weapon superiority of the whites fear that they will lose yet they seem to take some comfort in the fact that mell take a lot of wliitcs with us when wc go what about the others b ut what about the millions of others both black and white are they going to continue to quibble about what schools a handful of negro children will attend are they going to tish tish about unwed mothers and heavy welfare loads are they going to look upon the slum ghetto dweller as something less than human are they going to play partisan politics until the cities burn down are they going to let triggerhappy policemen touch off a holocaust arc they going to allow the threat of genocide to become a reality are they going to let the fear of interracial marriage lead them into a support of violence and murder the role of responsible citizens esponsible citizens of this country both black and white want to see inequities abolished and changes made they vvant to see the poor are treated as dignified citizens and that justice is granted to all they want to see cities flourish and the economy prosper they want to see an art and culture that encompasses all segments of this complex nation and they want to see the end of wars and the threat of wars they cant accomplish these things by sitting back waiting they had better begin to act right now they cant afford to let some citizens harass young children who are legally attending a public school they cant allow a single civil right to be taken away from anv man because of his race creed or color tliev cant allow discrimination in housing or jobs or public neighborhoods they cant allow overpriced inferior food in slum neighborhoods they cant allow rent gouging they cant allow crooked politics none of these thing can thev allow to continue if this nation is to be reunited or could it be that the extreme black nationalists and white supremacists are right can it already be too late t he days are past when

suffering seemed endless yet from a succession of prisons he wrote a series of letters to the kings and leaders of the world setting out the injustices done to their people and the reforms necessary if their dynasties were to survive to the religious leaders of the world he directed an accusation of lust for leadership and issued a call to come forth then from your churches and siimmoneth men back to the true path of god and of tlie peoples of the world he asked that they embark on a search for the true educator promised by all religions the name of this prisoner bahaullah which means the glory of god his purpose to promote the oneness of mankind and of religion on this planet the time the results of his efforts on the one hand scorn on the part of the rulers who today have fallen from power and whose dynasties some of them many centuries old have suddenly ended and on the other hand a growing world community of followers united by their conviction that he is the most recent in the series of educators sent by god and that his teachings will introduce peace to a planet which has never known it recently of these followers gathered at a series of world meetings held to commemorate the th anniversary of the sending of bahaiillahs tablets to the kings on each continent bahais gathered at the city designated for their area many for example gathered in lugogo stadium in kampala uganda they came from remote comers of the v ast african continent some in thick rubber shoes some in rope sandals some in leather thongs some in imported european footwear but most of them barefoot with their calloused soles attesting to their conviction of the importance of this gathering and so it was in new delhi india panama city panama sydney australia frankfurt germany and stateside in wilmette ill within the ranks of bahais the understanding of the significance of the th anniversar might vary slightly from continent to continent but the core of it was summed up by kolonerio oule chairman of the national spiritual assembly of the bahais of uganda as he spoke with a few friends before the conference opened in kampala im really here to praise this bahaullah he said yes indeed he came from god and told the kings what to do to help their people they didnt do it so now they have no thrones but people are ready now to move into the sun every man wants to be walking in the light when he turns to bahaullah he knows what way to take to get there in the tablets bahaullah had challenged the kings and leaders of the world to compose their differences and reduce their armaments o kings of the earth he wrote be vigilant that ye may not do injustice to anyone be it to the extent of a grain of mustard seed compose your dififerences and reduce your armaments that the burden of your expenditures may be lightened and that your minds and hearts may be tranquillized heal the dissensions that divide you and ye will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of your cities and territories demandeth we haye leanied that you are increasing your outlay every year and are laying the burden thereof on your subjects this verily is more than they can bear and is a grievous injustice in the eyes of the world the author of this tablet vvas without hope and without resources although bom husayn ali son of mirza buzurg who headed a noble and wealthy family in

the shah his lands vvere seized his wife and children driven into hiding and he himself forced to walk in chains from his country home to teheran and then face imprisonment in the siyahchal gradually bahaullahs followers found their way to the remote prisons where he was exiled and risking their lives carried his tablets to the kings and mlers of the world and his letters and writings back to their families and steadilygrowing number of lollowxrs first in a letter addressed jointly to all the kings and mlers of the world and then in individual letters to each of the foremost monarchs of that day bahaullah called them to examine his cause to safeguard the rights of the downtrodden and punish the wrongdoers warning them that if ye pay no heed unto the counsels divine chastisement shall assail you from cverv direction he informed his followers that the ottoman empire would soon exile him from adrianople to akka but when this happened in it did not interrupt the flow of letters to the most powerful and feared names of the day the emperor napoleon iii czar alexander ii heading the vast russian empire kaiser william i the conqueror of napoleon iii and the monarch of a unified germany

the ottoman empire when emperor napoleon hi received his first letter from bahaiillah he flung it down saying if this man is god i am two gods in this letter bahaullah called upon napoleon to look into the condition of his wronged subjects and begin measures for their assistance in his second letter sent from akka he prophesied that for what thou hast done thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion and thine empire shall pass from thine hands within two years napoleon suffered a humiliating defeat at sedan which cost him his throne and sent him into exile in england where he lived until his death following the death of bahaullah in his son abdutbaha named in his will and testament as the center to whom bahais should turn for the preservation of the unity of their faith began increasingly to turn his eyes to the west from he received american pilgrims for brief visits prior to the ending of his year imprisonment in in for a period of eight months he tiavelled throughout the united states with an integrated party of followers speaking at universities churches learned societies and before the fourth annual convention of the naacp everywhere he proclaimed the oneness of humanity he also warned of the possibility of racial warfare in america and urged that communication between white and black people be improved and injustices ended bahaullah has proclaimed the reality of the oneness of the world of humanity and announces that all nations peoples and races are one he said he has shown that although individuals may differ in development and capacity they are essentially and intrinsically equal as human beings just as the waves of the sea are innumerable and different but the reality of the sea is one he returned to haifa israel and when a few years later an american isitor told him that homes belonging to two chicago negro bahais had been dynamited he said i foretell things before they happen and i write about them before they occur the destruction of

that while their parents were struggling to erase ever vestige of acquired prejudice they themselves were gifted with the opportunity to grow up freer of such prejudice than any of their forebears

of them had already acquired new homelands new langitages and an accompanying increased awareness of people they compared customs and schooling laughed at the differences in clothing and befriended

madonna and infant jesus only about by inches done on a thin layer of gesso superimposed on a thicker coarse layer then placed on lime wood its vegetable and mineral value is thus about cents but to many its religious value is priceless throughout its history the black virgin has been the source of alleged miracles the inspiration for victorious armies and the reason for at least two executions grateful xilgrims have adonied the virgin with some precious stones to thank the ikon for its blessings to the peasant girl and the empress of russia alike the painting has had profound meaning and it is perhaps the most famous of all russian art relics today the black virgin of kazan insured against loss for a half million dollars lies in the steely silence of a bank vault in the small northern california village of mill valley thousands of miles from the site of the ancient civilizations it once influenced its only link with the past seems to be its nevcrending search for a home the story of the black virgin begins somewhere near the end of the th century when it was the prized possession of an old monastery in the port city of kazan on the kazanka river in russia the painting or ikon as such art pieces are called was then known as the holy mother of god of kazan it was later to become known as the blackvirgin because of the diuk complexions of the madonna and child and in due time to cause controversy for that fact alone after the ikon was brought to the us in an attempt was made to drop the word black from the original title which had been used for centuries ostensibly it was simply because of racial prejudice when it was found that news stories mentioning the black virgin of kazan evoked a tremendous amount of interest and curiosity from the negro community it didnt take long for those planning to exhibit it to agree that the adjectixe black should be dropped from the title there was no official pronouncement to that eflfect but evidence of the decision seems unmistakable members of an organization formed to buy it for the purpose of restoring the ikon to the custody of the eastern orthodox church and to enshrine it in san francisco began speaking of it as the virgin of kazan literature put out by the organization appealed for contributions to be sent to the fund for our ladv of kazan shrine in the organizations published material containing a picture of the ikon there was no suggestion of the word black even the ink with which it was printed gave the effect of a reddish brown color instead of the very dark hue which distinguishes the virgin on the face of it such an action makes it seem as if the eastern orthodox community of the san francisco bay area had become infected with racism but the answer goes far beyond that it must include the fact that among those responsible for the dropping of the adjective were some who actually wanted the fund drive for the black virgins shrine to fail actually indications are that there were two groups moti ated by the desire for the fund drive to fail one had political purposes as its raison retro the other had the crass desire to cash in on the enormous profits that could be made by acejuiring the ikon breaking it up and selling off its precious stones those politically motivated were the communist sympathizers of whom an active group exists among the orthodox they wanted the drive to fail because of their keen realization that the black virgin might well have the miraculous powers so many millions of people believe it to have they know that this painting more than any other relic has an amazing history as a focal point for marshalling the strength of people en tnassc naturally if such a relic could be enshrined in the us it would definitely not be in the interest of communism to prevent such a happening the communists resorted to one of the prime weapons unwittingly handed them by the united states this countrys record of racial prejudice but the political scheme seems doomed to failure just as the plan to sell off the paintings jewels failed and in all likelihood the black virgin will be enshrined in the u s it symbolizes as does no other relic the purpose of the great ecumenical movement that has been sweeping through the christian world since pope john xxiii called the first vatican council but in the year the only concern for the ikon was its value as religious art and when a mongolian army swept through the city in an orgy of burning looting and killing the painting was carefully wrapped in linen saturated with beeswax and buried iu the thick walls of the monastery there with the slaughter of kazan being complete the ikon lay hidden for hundreds of years and was forgotten by almost all who lived in the ruined citv by kazan was again a bustling trade port and it was at this time that a young virgin named matrona had a series of visions in them she said she saw a wondrous and beautiful face bathed in a golden light there was a further consistency about the visions in each one the light came from a particular spot in the ruins of the old kazan monasterv as the story of the childs visions began to grow among the townspeople it was decided to dig into the ruins and there the longlost art piece was found legend has it that when the painting was unwrapped and held aloft for the villagers to see the golden light from it became so strong tliat for hundreds of miles around even the blind could see the holy mother and christ child the people stood back in wonder at the sight of the black madonna wreathed in piercing light a huge crowd escorted the ikon to the church where it was received by a priest named hermogen now a russian saint on the spot where the townspeople found the painting a new monastery was built the first nun to take her vows there was matrona who became known as martha and was later abbess of the monastery three years after the discovery of the ikon kazan again became a city under attack as invaders came to plunder and destroy instead of again burying the black virgin this time the priests brought it forth and held it aloft as they blessed the faltering troops of ivan the terrible defenders of the city strengthened by the prayers and by the image of the virgin the troops went forth and annihilated their enemies townspeople credited the ikon with yet another miracle thus continued to grow the legend of the black virgin of kazan wien in the poles invaded the kremlin in moscow and battered the nationalist anny a russian hero prince pozharski rushed to kazan to bonow the miracle ikon he returned with his troops to moscow where the poles had imprisoned and star ed to death hermogen then patriarch of moscow loyal armies from other russian cities joined pozharski and the black virgin was held aloft for eneration and prayers in the bloody battle that folloved the poles were defeated and the holy painting was brought into the city with the victorious russians the legendary stories of the miracles of the black virgin of kazan became known to all the cities of the world and her faithful worshippers brought gifts of large emeralds diamonds nibies sapphires and giant baroque pearls a mask for the holy ikon was hammered out of silver and gilt with gold and the precious stones which wre later to include crown diamonds presented by catherine the great empress of russia were set into it a great cathedral in honor of the ikon was built in the kremlin at a cost of more than eight million pounds sterling or approximately million at the time and the painting enshrined there but the black virgin was yet to inspire another army for the frenchman napoleon was to invade russia and on the night of september he watched his drunken soldiers loot and set fire to moscow feeding the billowing flames with rivulets of vodka according to the diar account of marshal mikhail kutuzov the head of the russian nny went to the great kazan cathedral and removing the holy ikon and hiding it under his overcoat slipped back out into the night and rallied his forces to pray for strength courage and ictory napoleons army was defeated in the carnage that ensued and the emperor of france was forced to make a bitter retreat from the russian soil napoleons humiliation and the part the miracle ikon played in it was later immortalized by tolstoy in his classic novel war and peace after the black virgin of kazan was taken to moscow its popularity was such that two copies were made from the original one was sent to kazan the other to a museum at st petersburg now leningrad both of the copies were later stolenand since believed destroyedand when the thie es were caught they were executed at the time of the russian revolution the black virgin disappeared from russia probably taken by fleeing members of the royal family it later turned up in england after being sold along with other art objects to support the family in exile in the ikon came into the possession of explorer f a mitchellhedges and is now the property of his daughter anna mitchellhedges who lives in canada the ikon was brought into the united states in through the efforts of frank dorland a mill valley art conservator and one of the nations leading experts on russian and greek orthodox ikons dorland hoped to restore the ikon to the custody of the eastern orthodox church it was dorlands brilliant detective work that established through the materials and methods used the probability that the ikon was never painted in russia at all but in constantinople now istanbul turkey in about byzantine artists had a very different way of preparing the base of their religious paintings in addition the skin coloring of their madonnas was often darkhued now more than years later the story of the black virgin of kazan still has no ending for efforts to establish a final resting place for the painting have become engulfed in political and racial overtones in this country to determine why the ikon became the black virgin in the first place it is necessary to go back to th century constantinople while it is perhaps true that candle smoke and anointment with oil on holy days has had some effect on the rich dark beauty of the painting the figures were nevertheless intended to be dark in the first place and for the best of reasons to appreciate why the locale of the painting is so important in relation to the complexion of the subjects it is necessary to note that proliably all the madonnas painted in western europe from the days of fra angelico throughout the renaissance were practically without exception whiteskinned among those many works of art it is difficult to find one in which the complexion approaches that of the black virgin of kazan it is also virtually impossible to find so much as one madonna by a byzantine artist in books devoted to religious art indeed so far as those works are concerned it is as if no one east of italy and germany ever painted a madonna during or before the renaissance however in constantinople or byzantium innumerable artists painted madonnas over a thousandyear periodbeginning with the fall of rome to together these eastern artists produced more madonnas than all the west european artists combined throughout the renaissance but the madonnas the byzantines paintedthanks to the schism betaveen rome and constantinoplewere for eastern churches and missionaries who traveled east beyond the black sea and the caspian south into syria palestine mesopotamia and the lands along the persian gulf and north into the balkans and the vast northeastern hinterland reached by the great waterways such as the volga and the don and the people in these regions were by and large of a far darker complexion than those of western europe in the th century this was especially true of the area now known as european russia the part that lies to the west of the urals at that time the tatars were the ruling power and for hundreds of miles north from the black and caspian seas into the heart of russia the percentage of lightskinned inhabitants was small in relation to the numbers of mongolian and otlier stocks including even a percentage of negroid peoples even today there are large segments of darkskinned people in russia who reflect their mixed ancestry in the light of these facts it is quite obvious why the black virgin of kazan was painted that way by the byzantine artist he and his ecclesiastical superiors were fully aware that a fairskinned madonna and child would be unsuitable for use among such darkcomplexioned peoples who lived to the east for this reason scholars say that even in when the ikon was concealed in the walls of kazans ancient monastery to save it from the hands of invading mongols the complexions of its madonna and child were of just about the same hue as they are today furthermore since it stayed in its hiding place for better than x years before it was revealed through the visions of the peasant girl there is sound reason to feel that its colors are about two centuries fresher than those of other paintings of comparable age today the black virgin of kazan receives the same recognition from the roman catholic church that it does from the various churches of the orthodox communions when exhibited at the new york worlds fair three years ago it was housed for safekeeping in the vatican pavilion along with the picta and it has already been linked by roman catholics with the virgin of fatima who called for the conversion of communist russia in her alleged miraculous appearancc in portugal in therefore the black virgin may be termed the prime stnbol of the iiltiinate union of those two great divisions of christianity and since it is also becoming increasingly recognized in the same way by the anglican communion so often termed the bridge churcb between catholicism and protestantism it can v ery well play a powerful part in ending that division as well but the black virgin may perform a still greater serv ice to humanity than putting an end to those divisions it alone among the ancient relics of christianity symbolizes by the complexion of its faces the heart truth that there cannot be in the teachings of christianity any place for the vicious doctrines of racial discrimination and since there is no major country in the world where such a lesson could be put to better use than in the united states nor any other country where its use would be so vvudely reported throughout the glole it could very well be that its enshrinement in this country would have a tremendous impact upon the global evils of racismone vvdiich might prove decisive and that of course would be a most vvelxme ev ent to the virgin herself who undoubtedly regards efforts to restrict her ixrtrayals to only one skin color as an example of human intervention that is grossly presumptuous w hen april makes its appearance it is time to pack away those heavy winter garments and think of

all of them can be savored by those living in the most intemperate of climates they can transform an ordinary meal into a happenings idney poitier no longer goes four times a week to the new york woman psychiatrist who worked on his hangups for four years he has he says solved the worst of his problems he is finally he told writer judy michaelson a few weeks ago totally free owned by no man or woman he said that sometimes in his daydreams and sometimes in reality he sees the world as a jungle with some of the animals grasping grabbing each for his part and others in the kingdom trying to get on as well as they can live and let live not making any ripples but then he said there is one who is different but it is a difference that is earned there is one animal walking about making choices not out of greed or lust but exercising control his decisions touch the highest order so that his movements attract attention very quickly what will he do next sometimes the choice dazzles and its lonelv sometimes but there is no better way to live poitier was of course talking about himself he can now talk like that he is sidney poitier superstarfic superstar who is able finally because he is so way out in front to walk about make choices exercise control here is where he stands at and after years in the business he has an oscar a best actor one for lilies of the field and some films and four plays to his credit the films range from his first one no way out made in to three current onesto sir with love in the heat of the niiht and guess whos coming to dinnerwhich are making him a very rich man he did sir a lowbudget film shot in england for a mere to take care of my expenses but cleverly arranged to receive a percentage of the gross in ayear installments in just its first x dates in this coiintrv sir earned more than million for its distributors and its expected to earn iqward of million worldwide thus if poitier gets his usual percent of gross his a year income its stretched out for tax reasons from sir will go on for at least years similar deals were made on heat for which he was paid a reported x plus percent of the net it will earn about million worldwide and on dinner which reportedly brought him and a substantial percentage columbia pictures presi dent leo jaffe says that dinner will be the biggest earner in columbia historybigger even than bridge on the river kwai a recent poll by boxoffice magazine the film trade publication shows poitier ranking among the top male stars in terms of talent and boxoffice draw he placed fifth behind richard burton paul newman lee marvin and john wayne and was ahead of such big names as sean connery jack lemmon cary grant michael caine and steve mcqueen in a little more than two years poitier has risen from the he got for a patch of blue to the plus percent of net that universal will pay him for work next september in the lost man he is also committed to make two more pictures for united artists playing the virgil tibbs detective character he introduced in heat and premiering this summer is for love of ivy a film based on an original poitier storv and starring him and singeractress abbey lincoln ill tell yon bow hij poitier stands now says daniel mann who directed ivy the fellows at the releasing companies dont have to do any kind of selling job on his pictures anymore they just have to pick up a phone call a distributor in say cincinnati and mention poitiers name tlie distributor asks one question when can i have the film take ivy for example we finished shooting it and announced it would be released in july within a few days we had something like x theaters asking for it and that was just a starter poitier has formed his own e r production corporation named for his late parents evelyn and reginald and has signed a threeyear nonexclusive multiple production contract with columbia pictures whereby e r will develop an unspecified number of films for worldwide distribution by columbia says leo jaffe we have absolute confidence in poitier and well work with him on anything he wants to do in line with the contract hell be the producer hell decide on picture ideas hell make the decisions and well listen to himand agree im sure so sidney poitierthe undereducated bahamian boy who once slept under newspapers on new york rooftops who was kicked out of the old american negro theater because his west indian accent was so thick that everyone laughed at him who bought a radio listened to it every night for six months and imitated the sounds who got only for his first picture no way out in is today way out front the drummer boy leading the charge every hopeless black kids hopeless dream come true but theyre beginning to snipe at poitier it began late last year in a small new york literary magazine called readers writers the article was titled uncle tom is becoming a superhero and the wtiter was foster hirsch who is a graduate student in english at columbia universitv and who reads scripts for a film company he talked about y ol avantgarde treatment of the negro said that such poitier films as lilies and heat have substituted a myth in place of a direct and honest confrontation with the position of the negro in american society and described poitiers noble and pure characterizations in both films and others such as bedford incident pressure point patch of blue etc as onedimensional and simplistic and stereotyped hirsch wrote the characters poitier plays are too unrealistic and limited to continue to have force and his screen image is fast becoming as much a stereotype as the servants and mammies of earlier days the criticism was developed more fully and poitier admirers charge more viciously by negro playwright clifford mason several weeks ago in the new york times in the article why does white america love sidney poitier so mason talked about what makes for a proud image and what makes for a demeaning one and said it is a schizophrenic flight from identity and historical fact tliat makes anybody imagine even for a moment that the negro is best served by being a black version of the man in the gray flannel suit taking on white problems and a white mans sense of whats wrong with the vvorld i too am tired of pory ami bess but at least it doesnt try to fool us even though its negroes are frankly stereotypes at least we have a man a real man fighting for his woman and willing to follow her into the great unknown the big city poor boy from catfish row that he is what did we have in the bedford incident by comparison mason asked poitier as a black correspondent who went around calling everyone sir did anyone ever see gary cooper or greg peck call anyone sir when they played foreign correspondents in duel at diablo he poitier did little more than hold james garners hat and this after he had won the academy award what white romantic actor would take a part like that he gets to kill a few indians but gamer gets the girl and does all the real fighting poitier was simply dressed up in a fancy suit with a cigar stuck in his mouth and a new felt hat on his head about a patch of blue mason thought it was probably the most ridiculous film poitier eer made hes a newspaper reporter who befriends a blind white girl from the slums a girl whom he doesnt even make lo e to he gets her away from her whoring motlier and sends her off to a home for the blind was he asked mason ninning his private branch of the aspca the black society for the prevention of cnieltv to blind white girls the bspcbwg all this mr poitier endures said the times article and more without a murmur of protest now there are those who will say theres nothing else he can do they wont let him make anything else i used to console myself with the fact that that was probably true and it may very well be true but truer than that is the fact that he thinks these films have really been helping to change the stereotypes that black actors are subjected to in essence they are merely contrivances completely lacking any real artistic merit in all these films poitier has been a showcase nigger who is gien a clean suit and a complete purity of motivation so that like a mistreated puppy he has all the sympathy on his side and all those mean whites are just so many simon legrees perhaps poitier foresaw just such criticism when he himself last august in the new york times commented on writer joan barthels description of his onscreen self as an isolated paragon of sense andsensibility who roams the white world bringing order out of chaos deftly solving the problems of nuns lilies of the field and blind girls a patch of blue and women with suicidal inclinations a slender thread said poitier it is because the guys who write these parts are white guys more often than not they are guys in a business and they are subject to the values of the society they live in and there are iroducers to deal with who are also white and a studio with a board of directors also white so they have to make himthe negrokind of a neuter and it has to be avantgarde which is easy right you put him in a shirt and a tie and give him a whitecollar job you make him v ery bright and very intelligent and very capable at his job then you can eliminate the core of the man his sexuality his sexuality is neutralized in the writing but its not intentional its institutional to think of the american negro male in romantic socialsexual circumstances is difficult you know and the reasons why are legion and too many to go into so why does poitier play all those loveable neuters i wouldnt call it playing along he said its a choice a clear choice i would not have it so and if the fabric of the society were different i would scream to high heaven to play villains and to deal with different images of negro life that would be more dimensional but ill be damned if i do that at this stage of the game not when there is only one negro actor working in films with any degree of consistency where there are thousands of actors in films you know poitier said perhaps for those who might think he has been entirely happy to get the kind of work he has been allowed to do i have not had a part that was really challenging to me since the defiant ones the film with tony curtis was made years ago and poitier won an academy award nomination for it and poitier said i have never worked in a manwoman relationship that was not symbolic ive wanted to work vvdth a negro actress in a manwoman situation that was wann and positive im not interested in having a romantic interlude on the screen with a white girl id much rather have romantic interludes with negro girls perhaps this is one reason there surely are others why in guess vhos cominff to dinner poitier finally after films kisses for a very brief moment right on the lips a white girl actually he kissed katharine houghton a great deal and passionately too in that film but all of that footage was left on the cutting room floor before the film was released for public viewing and all of the still photographs that show these romantic interludes are kept in three press books on the third floor of the new york office of columbia pictures and are marked with bold red xs and the word hold which means of course that no matter how much of a superstar he is no matter how articulate and smooth and boyishlooking and acceptable he is no matter how much he is not the big black buck type like say brock peters poitier is still and he knows this black sidney poitier and even if he does kiss her briefly onscreen moviegoers see the kiss merely as reflected in the rearview mirror of a taxicab nobodyll ever be able to clip out of newspapers and magazines and save and look at and tack up on filling station walls any pictures of him making love to young white katharine which means and it means nothing more that despite all of poitiers years of standardbearing of being filmdoms jackie robinson who just must make good and open the way for others of being the good nigger while all around him such good niggers as medgar ev ers and the four birmingham girls were being killed operating still in are those antiquated codes which dictate just how much even sidney poitiereven sidney poitiercan be allowed to get away with under white americas watching eyes sidney says a nevv york woman vvho is vry close to poitier has lost his patience with those codes and with all those hollywood studio people who still operate within them he has been like you know the fellow who plays the fool only long enough to get into a position of control sidneys ready now to make his move poitiers maneuvering has already begun an example is his writing and treatment of his forthcoming film ivy it is a tender love story in which poitier plucks from contemporary american society a black woman a garden variety domestic worker glamorizes her idolizes her and in his words spoils her rotten despite poitiers prestige and boxoffice draw no major film studio would touch the ivy idea another comment on what even sidney poitier can get away with it was accepted finally by a justgettingstarted company paloinar pictures international which is a subsidiary of the american broadcasting company another manem er is poiticrs formation of e r productions from it will surely come the kind of films he says he has always wanted to makefilm whose comments are not trapped in the narrow confines of racism whose themes make no further contribution to the syrupy and very comforting for white audiences hollywood myth of the noble negro maltreated and misunderstood who is in his heart a really nice forgiving fellow who despite all goes about befriending blind girls helping foreignbom niins build churches aiding southern sheriffs and refusing neuter that he is to take his white soontobe wife to bed then there is the matter of poitiers maneuvering in the field of directing a psychiatrist could have a great deal of fun explaining why poitier chose as his first directing effort a play carry me back to morninfside heifdus which was in the view of all new york drama critics a very bad play whose central theme is that of a young white liberal who in order to help pay for the antinegro sins of white people sells himself as a slave to a black man but then poitier did tell judy michaelson the interviewer that there is one animal who is different a difference that is earned walking about making choices exercising control not long ago actually while he was filming some of those scenes that are now marked with bold red xs and the word hold poitier talked about what he after such a long time at standardbearing and dispensing filmed goodwill sees ahead for blackwhite relations afterall he tiilked to author roy newquist the interview is included in the recently published book a special kind of magic by roy newquist randmcnally co and this is what he said i dont think integration can work as simply as we presuppose we know now it is not as simple as we heretofore thought it might be not because people think a certain way but because of the institutionalization of certain habit patterns that cannot be changed until certain structural changes are made in the machinery that proluces the human being im speaking of the social procedure tliat produces a human being a twentyfiveyearold american is rather like a producta product coming off an assembly line designed to create a certain object or like the result of a recipe example you put beans in a casserole add salt sugar pepper little pieces of bacon water it doesnt matter how large or small the oven is all youre going to get out of that dish is baked beans follow you put a young human instrument into this socioeconomic complex we have in america where the values are overwhelmingly in favor of jjleasure and materialism and youre going to produce an individual who is not really a purveyor or supporter or practitioner or disciple of certain aesthetic certain human values you cannot hate people you dont know unless you are raised in a society where your propensity for hate is cultivated we have a propensity for hate we also have a propensity for love we have a propensity for fear and we also have a propensity for understanding we have the capacity to embrace all the opposites as tliey exist in nature they are encased in each and every one of us now a society that cultivates the love that is in us will find that love as it emerges from the person in his daily life spreads in the same way that hate or fear or distrust or whatever negative impulses and qualities exist now spread love can and should be more dominant than the negatives i dont believe that we in the united states teach the value of the human instrument we teach other values our children arent reared on how glorious it is to be human vv dont teach the glory of the human animal we dont teach our children the love of this incredible miracle called the human being we teach other things that culminate in a racial division a religious division a class division a lack of concern a callousness a disinterest in the needs of others i dont believe this is the wav life has to be or should be i believe that inherent in each individual in society is a positive quality of human life and that if we devise the kind of society or the aspects of society that wall cultivate these qualities vve vvould have a better society not until then will we hav a bettia society in which to live in order to discuss integration with this in mind have to depart immediately and say that i dont think integration is going to come about within the context of things as they now are think there has to be a gigantic change in the stnicture of our countryphilosophically economically politically sociologically it must be one simple example in order to eliminate slums you just cannot eliminate slums youve got to cultivate people to appreciate their transfer from the slums that cultivation alone will cost billions of dollars in adult education in strengthening the educational system in poor communities the job is enormous the elimination of shuns means that one hell of a lot of work has to be done with the people who live there an extremely dimensional attack must be made to ducatc the slum dweller beyond the capacity he now has mov ing him isnt conditioning him or educating him i think were going to have to reverse the obsession americans have with the profit system dont get me wrong im not putting down the profit system i dig it but i think that inherent in our profit system is a failure to encourage the individual to become useful to the community in ways other than making a material profit in other words if a man is out of work a black man or a white man whose skills are insufficient or not needed in the nation s labor pool why should he fnistrate himself in the wasteland of the unemployed community he should be of service to something even if its to the government he doesnt have to necessarily work for a profit were now in a situation where were going to have to find ways to employ people in areas other than profitmaking organizations and corporations because the profitmaking side of our industrial complex is not sufficiently elastic to absorb the entire labor pool it cant now and as the labor pool keeps growing the consequent unemployment will grovv vvorse i feel that a great many americans ought to be doing useful work but there is no place for them under the profit system and as marvelous and magnificent as this profit system is and has been for most of us it simply has no room for these people were going to hav e to make room for them because their numbers are going to grow i think that until the united states realizes that there is nothing it can do with its negro oriental mexican and puerto rican populations but create certain basic equalities of opportunity we are not going to have much progress in integration were going to have only token progress it all boils down to a simple blunt fact the white community is going to have to make up its mind whether it likes it or not to help or to suppress twenty million negroes in this country are not asking for something unreasonable theyre asking for better education better housing and an equal chance at the good life an equal chancethat is not being unreasonable either you help them get this equal chance or you repress them theres no middle way at all at all at all it isnt a question of vvhether the negro is going to mov e next door if open housing took place overnight there wouldnt be a rush to tbc vvffiite communities the questions are more basic housing is important and education is important but i dont think the negro can accomplish the meaningful equality by himself if the white world is indifferent were going to have enormous problems in this country serious and terrible problems if tbe white community puts a stop to the progress of twenty million negroes and feels that the negro has mov ed as far as he wants him to move as certain governors and police chiefs and rightwring organizations are saying the negro frustration will find no outlet and will continue to build and build and build to fierce explosions unfortunately such explosions will be treated by repressive measures one repressive measure will lead to another and its unthinkable horribly unthinkable the explosion that could come if the repression goes beyond the point of endurance but oh to understand to tolerate to love to enjoythese are the things that should be taught not to profit and to hate
if i may i would like to speiik out for myself and many of iny black brothers who are now in militar service for many of us who entered the serice back in the year will mean the end of our active military oblijjation this means one thing we will be returning to our homes in the states and to a new life for one refuse to retuni to the same society of racism and discrimination my country exteiidtd an invitation for me and many other blacks to enter into voluntary service of our country we accepted with the idea that we would be titilied as individuals rather than blacks hites reds or yellows we are due to return soon and we are expecting the same treatment from the american society wi arent asking very much when y on come right down to it all we ask is to be accepted as humans not some inferior race we are men and men are accepted on their individual characters and integrity not by tbe color of their skins blacks are good enough to die for america in xietnam therefore am snri that these same blacks are walling to die at home for a cause that is easier to understand this idea is not diflicidt to understand by anyone who considers himstdf intelligent so i say now america get your own house in order because if yon dont there wont be any house to get in order being in vietnam hasnt taken me from the struggle in america for mentally im very much aware of my blackness upon my discharge i will enter sclukl and take part wholeheartedly i am a young man years of age married and also have a baby boy now two months old i am now stationed at fort bragg n c waiting day after day not knowing when i will be chosen to represent a nation that will not recognize my race i would like to see an editorial expressing the discontent of all young black people in the service bccause we are the ones who arc manipidatcd to the glory and satisfaction of history w hich is not ours and men who sit behind their desks in plush offices writijig onr lives away we are no more than w ar tools being sent overseas into an undeclared war iat i want to know is w hen will there be an article expressing the inhuman conditions of forced patriotism death to our young and tlie remaining fact that we still have no country where wc are treated as equals as long as prejudice exists our goal should be to alleviate this situation not settling problems on foreign shores ceouce c burgess ft bragg n c i am writing in regard to what i think is the major problem that the black soldier is faced with today first of all i would like to say that i am a person with great love for the count i was born in but i think if the black man has to pay the cost of freedom in vietnam then he should be able to enjoy tliat freedom back home we here in vietnam feel as if we have nothing really to look for in the future because after all we are helping to insure freedom with our hves and back home our people are still second class citizens i dont really see where i can ser e with pride because i love my people just as much as any white soldier loves his i for one think it is time the negro unites under one cause to get what is ours under the law i tliink tliat today we have too many different groups and leaders and this more than any other thing is hurting us most then there is also the question of what is the right w ay to get our rights so far we have tried them all we have made some token progress but it is not enough i do not believe in violence but i dont think we should overlook it either after all the white man armed himself in the early days of our country to get his freedom and now is the time we should do the same for our freedom white people look on stokely carmichael h rap brown and even adam clayton powell as trouble makers but i ask if they are any more trouble makers than george washington and some of die odiers who led the people against the english see stokely carmichael and the rest as just men who sec what must be done no matter what the cost if wc arc ever to be first class citizens being nonviolent did not gain the w hite man his freedom from england nor did it gain him diis and from the indians and it wont gain the negro his rights under the law i would hate to sec our cities tom up but it just might come to that we really dont have anytliing anyway so i say hit tlie whites where it will hurt and that is the pocketbook i dont think the army will like my views on tliis subject but i believe i am doing what is right for my people after all tlie white man runs tlie army also pfc ciiaries t joves apo san francisco cahf i am a black man presently serving a tour of duty in the republic of south vietnam i am a dedicated reader of your magazine and also your sister magazine jet even when i was home i read your magazine every time a soul brother over here gets an ebony or jet magazine there is a waiting line of at least to soul brothers tliroughout our troop waiting to read it tlie black people back in the u s dont know what it means to a black soldier to have magazines such as ebony and jet to call their oun i was glancing through a back issue of jet and noticed a small article followed by a small series of pictures just before we went on an operation at first i couldnt believe it but there it was before me in pure black and white an apc armoured personal carrier sitting on a corner in riottom detroit with a cal machine gun mounted on top of it it stunned me because i know what one bullet from that gun can do to an individual i have seen people who have been shot by it eamjlc it goes into the human anatomy and makes a hole as big as a quarter when it comes out it makes a hole as big as your head and you mean to tell me that whitcy has a nerne to use sometliing like this against us black people of america it is hard on the black man he leaves home for vietnam after fighting a neverending war with uhitey for his freedom gets to vietnam and fights for the man who he was fighting mentally or physically against in the states if he survives for one year he returns home to only pick up the fight where he left off we dont belong over here you should see for yourself liow the black man is being treated over here and tlie way we are dying when it comes to rank we are left out when it comes to special jirivileges we are left out when it comes to patrols operations and so forth we are first tliink without any doubt in my mind whatsoever that there is just as much prejudice over here as there is in america but we are making it why because we have to we are used to being shot at killed and humiliated am only a pfc fighting somewhere in the central highlands of vietnam i wish there was something that i could do for my people back in the states all i can do is try to make it back home and help my people free themselves from their enemy and i hope that every black man serving in vietnam makes it we will ixcause its like tlic title song from the impressions latest hit record were a winner which by the way has raised a lot of controversy among the white population i am not enclosing my name because of certain technicalities a black pfc vietnam bias abroad in tlie wake of everything that has happened during my berlin tour as a member of the u s armed forces i am compelled to write you this letter as a soldier a human being a black american i am being done a great wrong i have experienced unfair medical practice bias and discrimination to a great degree persecution and conspiracy to force me out of the army over all of which i have no control i have also been unjustly denied the right to seek a better education i have exhausted all legal and administrative channels including the berlin j inspector general and the judge advocate general and have obtained no favorable results their hands are tied through no fault of their own because anything hapiening in berlin sfntjs in berlin i have abo seen tlie commanding general of berlin any soldier in berlin who goes to the inspector general knows he is just going through the motions and chain of command and that ultimately the status quo will bo upheld no real action will be taken and nothing will reach the usaeur inspector general in west germany for the first charge i have been refused medical treatment for my hands and eyes at tlie u s army hospital here in berlin secondly bias and discrimination of minority groups can be found almost anynnhere but they need not be tolerated hate is an tanotion w hich is explosive and tolerance is one of the simplest remedies mcnair barracks is in my opinion a hotbed of racial prejudice when morale is low in an organization as large as tlie army it leads to dissen sion tlie fnistration of knowing the ilsclcssncss of oncs eftorts in trying to obtain definite action is discouraging ones efforts can go as far as berlins bottleneck and there they die thirdly persecution and conspiracy can be accomplished in berlin because of this bottleneck i hiivc been denied tlic right to a better education was enrolled in a u of maryland psycholog course and was forced to quit by my company commander because according to him i dont dcserve the right i have been denied a transfer that i wanted have been given a transfer to a line company which was meant to lx punishment i hac been falsely charged with malingering on duty by my company commander this charge was obviously a cover charge to put me in confinement i love my country and would do anything hr her but have tried all channels and writing to you is my last hope that some definite positive and just action will be taken according to the governing laws of our land everyone in america is guaranteed certain inalienable rights under the constitution of the united states and we soldiers defending democracy miles behind the iron curtain are not to be and should not be treated as secondclass citizens as a negro sailor stationed with the pacific fleet in vietnam i want you to know that never before have i realized how much i could actually miss tlie sound of sweet soul music or the smell of barbecue and deepfried chicken and most of all the beautiful dark faces of our soul sisters after having spent seven months away from these luxuries i can only say that i ill be quite happy to see the nnoiui once again however dtspite all of this wc homeboys do manage to survive in each port but it is only because wc carry our ideas and sentiments with us wherever wc go and the people over here love us fveiy wherc vve go the familiar sound of soul brother can be heard echoing from the mouths of foreigners it is inspiring and wonderful to hear such words and everyone over here knows that we are a proud race as i read your magazine each month which my mother sends me without fail i no longer feel that our plight is a hopeless one progress can bt made and will ik made and i am sure that if these foreigners can realize this then it wont be long before the white american public will acknowdedge our role in society am

did not stand up in court but the individual w as sentenced to two months hard labor for insulting remarks and threats he made after being attacked quite a large number of white gis have been discovered asleep on guard duty yet disciplinary action wasnt administered as the situation looks now the negro cl is not going to accept much more of this open prejudice and exploitation from company

dumbfounded group of individuals over the tragic and wanton murder of dr martin_luther_king jr is the group of negro servicemen serving freedoms cause in vietnam in view of the circumstances which permit such acts to be perpetrated we can only ask ourselves one luestion hat the hell arc we doing here if its to gain freedom for tlie vietnamese then who will gain our freedom in tlie states while our blood is being spilled at a higher rate than that of any other group over here if its to preserve the freedom of all americans then its questionable if we are fighting in the right place at the right time many of the negro servicemen over here are a part of what is considered he now generation so weve disagreed witli many tf dr_kings nonviolent doctrines yet we all believed in liis sincerity and admired his eloquence fortitude and courage the war over here may he ovcr soon only wlien all tliese negro serx ieemen return to the states and get togetlicr will people realize the greatest

tak aside from being senseless foolish and utterly irresponsible an allout massive confrontation lxtween black and white as suggested can only result in annihilation of the blacks as a military man

pruneblack young marine privateand he pushed a bloodsplattered young north vietnamese army prisoner before him for a moment the marine chatted with a negro correspondent who had been observing the airevacuation of prisoners many brothers here the newsman asked anyplace you go in this big bad burly nam you gon find a brother the marine said the marine was at least thick red dust coered him from his helmetscribbled with rhymes from signifying monkeyto his mudcrusted jungle boots it was not jdossible to tell whether the dark brown splotches on the fatigue uniform clinging to his sweating body came from his perspiration or from his or someone elses blood catching hell the journalist asked yeah and giving plenty too when he turned his prisoner over to a young white oflbcer he patted the prisoners shoulder in a friendly manner and said you gon be all right then the young marine rummaged through several boxes of crations stacked near the landing strip he stuffed three cans of sliced peaches in his side trouser pockets two cans went in next to a tattered adventure magazine and started off across the field to get back to my outfit and during a recent four month stay in south vietnam the correspondent learned the truth of the young marines statementthat most any place you go in this war ravaged land youll find a brother a negro field grade officer who advises the south vietnamese army agreed youll find negroes into just about everything going down over here the officer said one hot sunday afternoon in his airconditioned villa in saigon the officer was the host to a group of about officers and highlevel american and vietnamese civilians who had come to watch a showing of the movie in the heat of the night before the showing the officer placed a stack of ramsey lewis lou rawls dionne warwick and aretha franklin records on his hifi set while his vietnamese girl frienda professional woman proficient in english french and chinese as well as vietnamesesupervised two servants who served refreshments the brother does all right here the officer remarked you see its just about the first time in his life that he finds he can really compete with whites on an equalor very close to equalbasis he tries hard in this kind of situation and he does well the officer added many negroes will extend to stay longer in vietnam than the normal monthsi will of the approximately negroes on active duty with the united states armed forces some are currently serving in south vietnam according to pentagon figures this means of course that they have some individual reasons for pursuing americas most tliorougldy docuiiieiited and most controversial war generally negro motives for being in vietnam parallel those of their white counterparts but at the same time reflect the particular ironies common to blacks in they are motives like status career and resignation status a proof of manhood and a youthful pursuit of excitement can be seen over and over again in the aims of the teenaged young blacks of the rd airborne brigade who helped take hill at dakto last november man we kicked tail much tail on that hill the young paratroopers brag in their encampment at tuyhoa on the south china sea young blacks in the marines who cleared north vietnamese army and viet cong troops from the historic city of hue after the vietnamese lunar new year or tet offensive brag in much the same way using much the same language thunder is the code name for an artilleryinfantry complex caiacd out of the jungles nortii of saigon where howitzer barrages and infantry sweeps try to keep a main highway open and out of the hands of the viet cong it is a place where soldiers fight heat frustration boa constrictors cobras malaria boredom one another and from time to time the viet cong here a lanky brooklyn draftee stated im gonna stay alive you hear me im gonna stay alive and get back to the big apple i didnt lose a damn thing here in the nam and i aint staying a minute longer than i have to the soldier is a rifleman for seeral months he had guarded the gun emplacements by night and flushed suspected viet cong from the jungles and a nearby rubber plantation during the day he had been in many fire fights and was neer wounded it aint luck he said with a grin its just that charlie knows i dont want a damn thing from him but a ticket back to bedfordstuyesant believe me i dont give a good goddamn who takes over this placei prove themselves said one marine company commander on the front you want somebody who wants to get in close and do some damage you dont want somebody whos going to debate the problem whether right or wrong many young negroes fit this mold and the military is there to fulfill their needs front line statistics show that while negroes make up about per cent of the total american troops in south vietnam they come close to per cent of those on the front line this is partially because they volunteer for combat duty at a greater rate than whites and partially because their generally less than average educational backgrounds place them in combat units officers in the airbome units say black troos usually represent about per cent of their total complcments but personal observations lead correspondents to suggest that the percentages are much higher airborne rifle platoons have often been observed as predominantly and at times almost exclusively negro on some operations and these high percentages in the highly mobile strike forces arc also reflected directly in the high death rates for negroes in vietnam pentagon figures say negro deaths come to per cent of the total american fatalities in vietnam currently the black death rate had soared to close to per cent during the late months of at which time the pentagon ordered a cutback in the participation of black troops negro servicemen consistently reenlist in the armed forces at a rate at least twice that of whites in the navy marine corps and air force and around three times the rate of whites in the armv most frequently career reasons and incomes keep these men in vietnam and not any sense of adventure or stopping the spread of communismthe often stated official line and this is true of the career officers and scores of black civilians working in south vietnam for the u s goveniment and major american firms army sgt george terry stationed in the chilly central highland city of pleiku extended to stay an additional six months in vietnam since i can save a lot more monv here than back home willie e wilson a second class petty officer in the navy stationed in nhatrang said the same thing and army maj beauregard lirovvn iii of de quincy la declared that vietnam represented a greater chance for advancement of the negro career military man than any place else in the world maj brown was then a logistics expert on geu westmorelands staff additional monetarv allowances for serving in south vietuam make serv ice here attractive for many military and civilian personnel and besides said a marine sergeant in the embattled and surrounded kliesanh in februiuy you damn sure cant spend it here you got to save it civilian workers in south vietnam can earn from to per cent more than their normal salaries in the united states you take a cat making that long bread and the fact that he dont have to put up with a lot of stateside discrimination and some of us will probably stay here forcver said one electronics technician stationed in bangkok thailand several negro civilians in southeast asia have said they did not think they would ever want to work in the united states again one was a physician from riehmond a dr isaiah a jackson who worked around the clock to heal wounded vietnamese civilians hurt during the tet offensive assigned to the municipal hospital at danang he saw close to three thousand civ ilians flood the facility that was made to care for some persons work in vietnam offered a sense of fulfillment and a world i never knew existed said dr jackson donald scott of pittsburgh pa who lives in bangkok with his thai wife and two small children does not think he will be going home soon ii ever scott is an aircraft maintenance supervisor the situation of the black conscriptthe drafteeis quite different most of the time its different for tlie draftee who remains a civilian at heart and docs not go ape or gung ho for the regular army or the paratroopers a specialist th class in saigon explained the draftee feels he aint got no business herehe didnt volunteer for nothing and he dont make them fabidous salaries all he can do is count the months and stay alive and count the months and month counting is a very popular sport in the nam where the normal tour is for one year after the rest and rehabilitation leave from three to six months after arrival the talk of vietnam is about short time and short timers im so short the expressions go that i can sit on the side of a dime and dangle my feet or pm so short i need a step ladder to reach a snakes belly said one draftee coming back from a fire fight with a viet cong unit near aichi they ought to get us shorttimers back to the rear i been chasing charlie and hes been chasing me for eleven months and they still keep me out in the field it would be a damn shame to get killed after eleven monthsif i got killed with just a few weeks left to spend here id be mad as hell there were some nonwhite youths drafted during the year and they represent per cent of all men drafted during that year although the full ramifications can not yet be determined the war in vietnam has given the black fighting man a visibility his forefathers never came close to realizing while they fought in previous american wars the vietnam conflict is blanketed by correspondents and photographers and for the first time in history war is brought into american homes in living color by television just hours later it would not be possible under these conditions to say the negro is not intrinsically involved in the fighting and as it happens in any situation of great stress racial differences between blacks and whites have disappeared on the fighting fronts at the front the main thing is to stay alive and you do this most often by depending on the man next to you often this dependency will give rise to very close combinations a white sergeant who heads up a heavy mortar crew at a firebase camp in phuyen province nicknamed hillbilly because he came from rural tennessee argued loudly with his negro platoon sergeant his superior because the platoon sergeant had refused to promote hillbillys negro assistant the hell with your damn regulations hillbilly said at one point this man docs the job and he dcserves the promotion and if you dont promote him tm going back down on the line with the grunts foot soldiers and im taking him with me then his negro assistant joined the argument but calmly wait a minute hillbilly he began i appreciate you fighting for me my man but if you go back down there with the grunts you go by your damn self the racial distinctions are much more pronounced in the rear echelon areas there the tendency is to separate during offduty time khanh hoi is a lot cheaper than tu do street on the latter pretty vietnamese girls earn their money by getting servicemen to buy saigon tea for them and beer and whiskey for themselves the tea is actually tea nonalcoholic and sells for the equivalent of in most places the girls chat amiably with anyone who buys the tea and at the end of the night most of them perch prettily on the back seats of motor scooters driven by their fathers brothers or husbands and go home said a negro sailor stationed in saigon you let a black cat see his money and plans for the night go zooming down tu do street on the back of some motor scooter when he had other things in mind thats why the brother hangs out in khanh hoi he knows what hes buying and you know how the brother ishe could have a pocket full of money and still try to talk himself into some friendship another khanh hoi habitue stated this is the place to come when your bread is short and your line is long phvsicallv the khanh hoi district is about four blocks of bars and small shops although a major hotel and one of saigons best french restaurants the william tell is also in the complex while negro in saigon for instance before the tct offensive cut down on the servicemans fraternization with vietnamese civilians white offduty troops would flock to the tu do street area of bars and night clubs while negroes gathered in the khanh hoi district it must be pointed out however that neither area vvas at anytime exclusively white nor exclusively negro both groups could always be found in both areas but the preponderance was white in the more expensive tu do street and black along trinh minh tlie street near the docks in khanh hoi vietnamese civilians said the khanh hoi district was also popular with senegalese troops serving with the french during the frenchindochina wars half senegalese and half vietnamese youngsters are frequently seen in this district i get so tired of that goddamn hillbilly music one black soldier said explaining why he came to khanh hoi a fevv seconds later he was pounding the table with a vietnamese girl friend and lxth were singing respect along with the record by aretha franklin another said chucks all right until he gets a beer under his belt and then its nigger this and nigger thatand besides to be honest chuck aint too much fun you dig servicemen make up most of the buying and talking customers the area is also quite popular with merchant seamen of both races the olympia bar does a large greek sailor business and with whites fed up with the commercialism of tu do street in one of saigons poorer districts khanh hoi has been a reported viet cong stronghold but it was not until recent weeks tliat tliere was lighting in the area so then the brother is indeed in tlie nam he is a crunch or grunt terms applied to riflemen and taken from the sounds of soldieringthe crunch of boots and grunts of struggle and he is an officer a noncommissioned officer and a civilian his presence cannot honestly be dismissed as some military spokesmen have tried with remarks like hes a good loyal american and a good professional soldier nor with the characteristic bragging by a black paratrooper that hes kicking asses and taking names there are simply too many questions raised and ironies pointed up by the negro in vietnam emerging as an integrated and integral interpreter of american far eastern policy no judgement of that policy is intended here he represents a new chess piece on that american racial chess board there is hound to he

or the pilots and ground crews of the united states air force lt gen benjamin o for ier which he never uses dais jr is a symbol a living legend ramrod straight in body immaculate in dress and forceful in purjjose the nations first and only negro air force general commands respect from others in the military and in years he as a combat pilot has flown missions over north africa and europe commanded thousands of men ranging from squadrons to wings and fraternized with ranking government officials and world leaders what he has donedespite the hostility of some whites and blacksfar exceeds the expectations of former west point classmates who snubbed him back in the s at the u s military academy the points black ben who is really a golden brown hue has penetrated the barriers that limited the upward progress of his father a negro cavalry officer and col charles young a once exalted cavalry officer who died brokenhearted because of army bias from a negro youth who led his cleveland central high school class in scholarship only to flunk his first try on a west point examination young ben forged a trail in the rigorous military that brought his spectacular record to the attention of u s presidents he dogged pushed and maneuvered his way through dixielike types biased army customs and even jealous blacks as an officer on the mo c he refused to rely on color as a crutch he detested being identified as a negro and for years refused to be recognized as that negro general this attitude robbed negro troops of an idol and hardly endeared him but b o davis jr cared little his future remained with the military what counted to him was his ability and he was confident once while commanding the nd fighter group in italy lt col davis admonished a negro noncommissioned officer who attempted to appeal for consideration on the basis of race with im vour color but not vour kind slated to become deputy commander of the u s strike command at mcdill field in florida this month gen davis will be second in command of a small planning group responsible for deploying and putting into action a combined u s force anywhere in the world tliis strike command is regarded as a unique experimental group that introduces new weaions and techniques in military operations representaties of all branches of the service are engaged in the project previoiislv gen davis served as commander of the th air force with headquarters at clark air force base in the philippines with some men under his supervision the general was credited with easing tensions among the americans and filipinos before he was assigned to the base the citizens frequently harassed air force personnel gen daxis quickly established a friendship program in a move to reduce the friction once when he was asked whether his race was beneficial to him during his cxmmands in asia gen davis answered brusquely i supposeto some degree then recapturing a steely countenance he concluded the discussion he is seldom talkative about racial problems always the air force technician he finds topics bordering on planes or men more fascinating he is withdrawn and never engages in talk on nonmilitary subjects except with close friends there is a wide gap between his private and his public life returning to assume a command in the u s this year the yearold general easily could become an asset for either lbj or vice president hubert humphrey in the fall presidential election history might repeat itself for the son as it did for his father the first negro general brig gen b o davis sr who ironically got much needed steam for a promotion from outside the army in the election year of democratic president franklin delano roosevelt faced a fonnidable opponent in republican wendell willkie flashing a one world slogan and booming peace and brotherhood willkie sought support of the nation s voterseven making a determined bid for negro help a month before the crucial election fdr accounted for a surprising militaiy breakthrough he announced the nomination for promotion to brigadier general of col benjamin o davis sr marking the first time a black man had achieved the general officer rank in the rmy the political move was even more surprising because col davis who had been retired years before logged a year service record and was well past the age of military fitness at it took the force of politics on the basis of race to unlock the door of opportunity now his son with only four years remaining before a scheduled retirement may be promoted to a fourstar general by president johnson in when president dwight d eisenhower named the sixfoottwoinch officer as the air forces first negro general he reaped considerable lineage in the press three years ago president johnson took the occasion of a slowpaced week at his texas ranch to announce davis nomination to lieutenant general the action resulted in a continued front page coverage with discontent among negroes rising because of the ietnam war and the democrats finding little enthusiasm among young blacks politicos hint that president johnson well could tap young bo again for a otc thrust in months ahead the oeremphasis on the steady climb of gen davis however has clouded what many black officers call discrimination until this summer when army col frederic e davison was nominated for the rank of brigadier general no other service ixasted a black general despite the protestations of dais that would hate to think i was selected on the basis of race the precise talking general has gained attention and recognition jartly because of increased negro voting power and the attempt of the military to offset charges of discrimination at the highest lev els because of the generals neutral position on civil_rights and his noninvolvcmcnt with the brother policy his tremendous air force record has had little impact in the total black community even before the rise of the black jower movement boasting few negro friends and rarely honored by a negro institution or organization gen davis xdojmlarity is dwarfed by a lower ranked air force crony col daniel chappie james yet even his selfjoroclaimed nonidentification policy has not wiped out the usefulnes of lt gen davis few of the men who have served under the general will criticize him for being unfair says an expilot the guys griped about his sxit and xolish methods but they knew if they had to come before him theyd get a fair hearing it wasnt like being brought up before a southerner the general also interceded in cases of negro officers and behind the scenes helped many a young pilot find himself he probably will never get his just due from us said a friend he doesnt think black or white he thinks air force for years the air force has been the branch of service in which the younger davis has excelled after graduating from the academy in the first negro to do so in this century he chose that branch as his specialty but was tunied down because no unit would accept him as a result the then lt davis picked the infantry it wasnt until world war when the allblack th pursuit squadron was organized that capt davis started from scratch learning to fly and commanding men at the same time after taking his first unit to north africa davis returned to prepare the nd fighter scjuadron for action in the european theater on a mission oer vustria he was awarded the silver star for gallantry marking another first since then he has won numerous awards says an aide davis had to be tough he had to set the example one slip and the experiment would have failed showing his leadership ability during this jim crow period davis was the guinea pig when the air force pioneered gingerly with integration in the ranks it didnt take long for the spit and xolish martinet as he was often described to prove himself he excelled as a pentagon staff planner and commanded the st fighter interceptor wing of the fifth air force as well as bases in korea germany and formosa where he spearheaded defense of the island against red chinese assaults says a white house aide any president would be proud and confident to promote gen davis his career is far from over l ike many other chill and uncompromising breezes the military draft blows strongest through the worn brick and stained clapboard of americas black ghettos so it has been during this countrys police actions of the past years and so it threatens to be at least until the present war is ended as it packs off the best the black communities have to offer the draft is challenged by a small but growing opposition akin to that of white draft protesters but nevertheless unique based on the logic that a man should not pay the premium when he cannot get the policy but the vast majority of black draftees continue to go quietly carrying not only that overnight bagful of home cooking which will be left at the camp gate but also the baggage of a personal history replete with poor education and limited choices an invisible duffle that will not he left at the gate shuttled into chores for which his circumscribed experience has made him a natural todays black draftee will be likely to find himself with a rifle probably in a rice paddy fighting in vietnam just as the colonial senegalese did for the french years ago but despite the inequities surrounding his military servicc the black draftee will often find life in the armed forces less abusive than life outside he will join with his enlisted brothers to reenlist at rates far above those of his white counterparts in this manner the american system fills a portion of its military quota the drafts offensiveness to the american dream is a much debated issue while americansofold detected something in it antithetical to their fabled individualism only the disaffected today seem to find in it a severe personal affront seen in broad perspective a historical reversal seems to have occurred the ranks of the disaffected the radicals are swelled by those in the american individualist tradition while the conservative supporters of the draft seem to be those who relinquished their individualism to the exigencies of the great wars it is instnictive to note that the most vigorous opponents of the draft are young whites bom after world war ii and blacks systematically ccluded from full participation in either world war but even if the drafts effrontery in itself is the prime stimulus to negro resistance the black critics argument that the draft has been applied inequitably to negroes is supported by facts this much has been acknowledged by such proponents of the draft as the new york times hanson baldwin who nevertheless suggests that the inequities stem from the black mans civilian cxperience and constitute a problem which the draft cant cure and for which it should not be blamed according to available figures about negroes were snatched into service during they represented per cent of all draftees the figure corresponds with the trend of the s during the first half of which negro inductions never fell below per cent and reached a high of per cent in about per cent of draft aged men are black examined from another angle the rate of black induction appears to be hvice that of white a report by u s rep robert kastenmeier d wis and his research assistant stuart applebaum indicates that while only per cent of the examined negro draft candidates were acceptable per cent of the acceptable men were actually drafted parallel figures for whites showed that per cent of the candidates were acceptable but that only per cent were actually drafted even drearier figures suggest the fate awaiting many black draftees anny deaths in vietnam from through were per cent black even though the percentage of black gis in southeast asia during those years hovered around per cent the army death figures for blacks had been per cent for the y ears and per cent for ninetyseven per cent of draftees go to the army but the broad statistics do not tell the whole story as of december per cent of black men in the army were assigned to combat units compared to per cent of white soldiers while black troops in vietnam comprised per cent of combat unitspentagon category infantry gun crews allied specialistsas of december a further refinement of the statistics to show the number of black footsoldiers is una ailable the defense dept says it neither breaks down negro participation this far nor distinguishes draftees from enlistees in the combat category hints of the tnie state of affairs on vietnam battlefields come from onthescene observers and participants jesse m lewis a washington post reporter toured vietnam as a correspondent and upon his return published some of his observations in the philadelphia inquirer of april there appears to be a higher concentration of negroes in airborne infantry and cavalry units than in artillery he wrote in many of the smaller combat units in vietnam like platoons and squads negroes seem to make up to per cent of the strength the vuhierability of the black soldier in vietnam is more poignantly described in a firsthand report by david parks parks kept a daily chronicle of his experiences as a combat soldier assigned to a jungle tank the chronicle has been published as a book gi diary by harper row on january he scribbled this into his diary an fo foiavard officer is required to be with the patrolling squad at all times and there are only three fos to cover squads the odds are against him sgt paulson handpicks the men for this job so far it seems to me hes fingered only negroes and puerto ricans i think hes trying to tell us something i do know he gives me a sour look every time he sees me at the fdc fire direction control controls every time he comes i get the feeling that i should have been bom white if only tlie souls and puerto ricans coidd tell the world what really happens to them in this mans army on february parks stote just got kicked out of my beautiful fdc job i am now forward officer parks attached to the first platoon coininand track armored personnel carrier on mission our platoon lias to dismount and go after charlie the vc on foot and im carrying that telephone with the antennae which makes a beautiful target its a sergeants job but paulsons not going to promote me as suggested by parks the attitude and habits of the larger america can operate against the black draftee and his enlisted counterpart at the lowest leel of anny organization far beyond the range of the statistics according to a black artillery officer carrying a rifle in the infantry is just like pushing a broom in civilian life you dont escape it in the infantry for the same reasons you dont escape it on the outside inferior education and no alternatives the whole bit the situation has existed since the korean conflict during which scientific american reported in may soldiers from the lowest income groups had four times the casualty rate of those in the highest income group the casualty rate among negroes was twice as high as it was among whites but even for the black draftee who did not want to leave his street corner cronies or his delta family displaced b the chopping machine there does exist that one alternative inadvertently described by the artillery officer abo e who would prefer a broom to a rifle very few would as the reenlistment officials have come to realize against this background of acquiescence stand the symbols of resistance muhammad ali and cleveland sellers who refused to go and the late dr martin_luther_king who sought to weld the peace and rights movements into a single instrument and beyond the symbols are the black college students on both black and white campuses growing ever more sensitive to their uniqueness and ever more reluctant to participate in americas military adventures the evidence of a diffuse resistance is everywhere last year gen lewis b hershey director of the selective serice was hooted off the platfonn during an address at howard university also last year the new york times found most black campus militants opposed to the draft and almost all opposed to the war in vietnam and a harris poll of negro attitudes to dr_kings role in the peace movement showed that less than half thought kings criticism of the war would injure domestic rights efforts in the rhetoric of the militants there is a clear distinction between white and black draft resistance an example comes from lenneal henderson a student at the university of californias berkeley campus white people intellectualize henderson says we have a different reason for not going we haent enjoyed the benefits of this society the whites are resisting as citizens we resist on the ground that we arent citizens he who has no country should not fight for it the spirit though not the vehemence of hendersons opinion has been picked up by some notsomilitant people for example the president of the michigan naacp suggested that men from poor circumstances be deferred from the draft as long as they either attend school or work his remarks echo those of two howard university student editors who argued before a senate inestigating committee that black people should receie special consideration that those who suffer in the ghettos should not be asked to lay down their lives for the country but despite the hot words of refusalhell no we wont goand even though some of the well known resisters seem willing to accept prison the filling of the jails does not loom as the tactic of draft opponents one man who went to jailtwo years in the danbui conn federal correctional institutedavid bell a sncc official who said he had regarded prison an honorable alternative to the draft now advises black men to fight the draft any way you can but dont go to jail bell who was released in says he came to realize i should have taken another course i was just rotting there it became a negative experience and my whole personality was taken apart dr_king had urged blacks and whites to boycott the draft by registering as conscientious objectors risking prison but not guaranteeing it ali refused the draft on religious grounds just as have the jehovahs witnesses with arying success for the past years fighting his local boards unwillingness to grant him a religious exemption ali recently asked tlie u s supreme court to reverse the board because all of its members were white sellers based his refusal on the absence of black men from the draft board that called him by doing so he put himself squarely in a recent southern movement backed by black moderates like detroit congressman charles c diggs the mississippi nacps charles evers and a mixed bag of rights lawyers to halt the proceedings of allwhite georgia mississippi and south carolina draft boards sellers was called in georgia there are few black voices supporting negro participation in the war one of these is that of boy wilkins naacp secretary who felt the need to dissociate himself from dr_kings antiwar stance wilkins drawing a line between domestic and foreign problems as many both white and black do argues that negroes are not really inclined to participate in foreign policy debates citing world war ii as example he insists that black americans were inclined to give their country allout support while continuing the campaign without letup against racial discrimination one of the legacies of the world war he says was the abolition of segregation in the armed forces carl rowan in a syndicated column suggests that kings appeals against the war threatened the loss of friends and victories won in the earlier civil_rights movement a proponent of the draft is col john tliomas martin the director of selective service for vvishington d c lie is the only negro draft director in the continental united states there is another in the virgin islands and has about registrants mostly black under his jurisdiction col martin believes the draft provides an opportunity for the ghetto youth to help himself its an opportunity for the inner city youngster to escape the ghetto he says and a chance for him to determine just what he can do its not just a matter of staying in the service as a career but of developing a skill he can use in civilian life the benefit of the draft he maintains is that its existence encourages men to enlist other voices of support come from the ubiquitous black noncommissioned officers who hae found a warren in the armed forces a place of some responsibility of some dignity and a future with reasonable pay one such man is sidney r brown a sergeant in the army airborne serving in vietnam he seems to speak for all those black career men drilling recruits in each of the countrys training camps and leading multiracial squads around the southeast asian swamps and for all those young black men in the north carolina tobacco country dreaming of the day they can go to fort bragg and train for the green barets according to sgt brown the army has made more advances toward racial harmony than anyone else the sergeant may not be saying much but he is saying something however much american racism may work its way into the ranks the armythe noncommissioned part of itis well integrated as far as assignments housing and advancement are concerned some would say the combat forces are overintegrated the only catch is that the integration may have come too late it has come in a time when many americans are souring to war and losing their respect for soldiers when even the most hawkish hawks regard footsoldiering as dirty work rendered almost obsolete by bombs and the sophisticated machines of war the words cannon fodder have dropped from the lips of critics black and white ranging from tlie young radical cleveland sellers to the old politician adam clayton powell sensitivity to black criticism and recognition that it is neither hollow nor unrepresentative has prompted the selective service the defense dept and the president to make some changes within the past year and a half the number of black men fighting and dying in ietnam has decreased slightly as has the rate of black inductions both figures are nevertheless well above per cent black share ol the u s population one of the biggest changes has been in the composition of the nations draft boards the selective service headquarters reports that over the past year and a half the number of black local draft board members has increased from to or from per cent to per cent although the percentage is still weak in comparison to the per cent that can be legitimately demanded the increase represents a startling change in some southern patterns arkansas which had no black draft board members in now has or per cent louisiana which also had none now has alabama recently appointed its first three members while mississippi continues to insist upon remaining all white south carolina has six georgia has credit for the changes is usually given gen hershey himself for his appeals to southern governors the most dramatic changeannounced as a remedy to the drafts inequitiesis this years alteration in the shape of the draft pool the elimination of graduate student defennents and the abolition of the critical occupations list the impact of this change on black inductions is clear fewer whites will be receiving those deferments for which their education and free occupational choices have heretofore made them eligible as a result fewer blacks should have to be called to fill the draft quotas but deferments for college students remain and according to a selective service spokesman local draft boards may determine what occupations are critical to their individual communities thus whites better schooled than blacks may continue to pursue the same deferments they always sought they can stay in school until they become family men or until they can enter service as rotctrained officers and they can aim themselves at their communities greatest manpower needs usually educated talents and even though black representation on draft boards is increasing some stiff bigotry and jaded attitudes linger in the local arms of the selective service last spring newsweek caught the chairman of atlantas draft board saying this nigger julian bond the former sncc officer now a georgia state representative we missed him ive always regretted that last month a chicago board spokesman hunting dodgers on the south side responded this way when asked if the draft delinquents could be regarded as conscientious objectors no they arent that at all we have found few negro boys who are they just say they object to going because of religious reasons because most of them just dont want to they pretend to believe in god and will say t dont want to kill anybody then right afterwards they go out in the streets and cut some persons throat along with these biases goes the general intent of selective serice officials and behind that the questionable philosophy guiding the drafts use can the draftconsidering what it has becomeever offer fair treatment to an abused and excluded minority few can ever really know on what premises the selective service is operating but if rampart magazine is correct the draft is concerned with more than merely filling military quotas it is also concerned that magazine contends with keeping folks in line on the home front such use of a go ernmental device for a second and unstated purpose is not new taxes have long been used to regulate trade as well as to raise revenue according to ramparts the drafts unstated purpose is to employ the threat of military service to channel civilians away from opposition to the military establishment as long as local draft boards have power to excuse vast numbers from serv ice it remains cnicial to blacks whether the principle of channeling is followed an abused minority partially outofwork and angry with a growing militant core is neither safe nor compatible with the militarys aims by any definition and if channeling remains in the minds of draft lxards young blacks will continue to be hauled in large numbers from streetcorners to training camps from newpolitics meeting houses to mess hcalls and from dashikis to muddy fatigues but even if the changes in the draft boards and in the selectiv e service regulations eliminate inequities in inductions it remains to be seen vvhether they will alter the distribution of black draftees within the services the odds are against it phd candidates law students and mathematicians from raytheon are unlikely to relieve the black footsoldier on the firing line c risply starched shoes polislietl to a

ranks halt she shouted now when i sav left flankmarch i mean left flank march across the field a knot of black gis watched in amusement wdiat cant understand one drawled is why any girl would want to volunteer for the service i just cant understand it at all if the women in the armed forces have not succeeded in winning over a great many male admirers it may stem from their unofficial motto free a man to fight in the tradition of joan of arc who donned armor to battle the inv ading british women volunteers are taking an increasing part in the supportive albeit noncombatant roles of the american defense svstem and thev want more as one wac colonel explained what we have here is woman power we take pride in ourselves in our country and in our unifonn and we can do almost any job that a man can do and frankly lets face it when a man sees a woman performing a job better than himself hes jealous women found a permanent position in the military as a result of world war ii vvhen thousands of them signed up to help the war effort who hasnt seen the films and pictures of women in battle fatigues and helmets ready to help out in time of ned today a woman officer in any of the branches whether it be women in the air force popularly called waf army wac navy waves or marines can aspire to the ultimate military rank either admiral or general yet few negro girls serve as commissioned officers and sgt esther lewis a veteran of years in the anny says negroes are much slower in making promotions there arent many negro first sergeants and i just dont know any black girls with ranks above that despite this charge the womens armed forces claims that a black girl now will find many opportunities that just did not exist in the infancy of american women in uniform gone are the negro platoons and white platoons and in its place the serv ice has enforced integration other changes hav e affected womens militarv status although men once thought of girls as second rate soldiers and sailors ladies now fill hundreds of specialized jobs as stenographers nurses medical and dental technicians electricians computer programmers and public relations experts to name a few and they now receive the same pay promotions and benefits as men do why would a black girl choose to volunteer in the military says sandy banks a recent high school graduate awaiting wave induction in chicago at home my mother and father wouldnt let me do vvhat i wanted or let me live my ovvm life ill have to find independence sometime anyway and i might as well do it this way although negro enlisted women comprise only an estimated four per cent of the women in the armed forces sandy feels more negro girls would enlist if they got the word in general all branches of the service demand educational prerequisites as a means of choosing potential officers and enlisted women a girl betvveen the ages of and with a high school degree may qualify to enlist a college graduate may sign up for officers candidate school and a registered nurse may be able to join the nursing corps of the army navy or air force each service insists on character recommendations good physical condition yes you can wear glasses no you cant be plump and for enlisted girls a written iq test barring any complications along those lines induction is prompt a young lady can sign her contract in the morning and that night find herself in basic training or officers candidate school shell be in the arinv now for the next two to four vears indeed most negro girls go army if theyre going at all when doris day was graduated from little rock high school this year she decided to take the plunge and enlist i always wanted to she nervously told another recruit on the plane to wac training center in ft mcclellan ala i think well like it they reassured each other yeah its only for three years so clutching her orders in a inanila folder and carrying her authorized two small suitcases and makeup kit doris and her newfound friend arrived at ft mcclellan to join the girls who take the army eightweek basic training course each year its tough experienced wac e delois nash admits when asked about basic i would rll all the girls who are coming into the army several things first a girl must know herself and know how to accept things she must be honest and be of good character and she must be able to stand up for herselfshe cant be chicken in an office at the ft mcclellan womens army center a secretarytype wac beamed as she watched recniits parade outside see that she pointed to a group of girls standing at attention now thats sharp theres not a wrinkle in any of those skirts all those shoes are spitshined this is what we mean by pride three days after her arrival doris was still waiting in a temporary barracks for the rest of her assigned platoon to move in but already she and the other recruits had been initiated into some of the mysteries of military life she had learned that a recniits day begins promptly at hours am and ends at hours pm every activity including inspection chow classes and company duties will be performed on time she had found that good beds must be tightlymade a quarter should bounce on the blanket and that the army makes no allowances for feminine touches in housekeeping the long rows of barracks foot lockers must stand rigidly aligned with nylon stockings panties and brassieres rolled in little balls and shoes placed neatly under each bed and the girls reminded themselves this was just the beginning as they waited for basic training to begin doris and her new friends about a third of them negro found tliey had lots of time to get acquaintedand worry doris explained mostly we just sit here and talk and try to keep from crying its so lonesome and we dont have much to do were supposed to be taking tests and getting uniforms but we havent done that yet with a bewildered frown and a glance at an officer standing nearby doris added softly theres all these ruleslike we cant use certain showers and were not allowed to talk in the latrine some of my sergeants i like but some of them are tough later on inspection a sergeant gave the girls an example of what the army means by a certain way to do everything proudly surveying a mirrorshined floor she said see that center aisle it is forbidden territory we call it gods aisle because no one ever walks between those beds we want to be able to see our faces when we inspect these floors enthusiastically she added as a reward just before graduation each girl may walk down this aisle once then of course they buff it up again for the next mornings inspectionabout the only thing that doris and her corecruits hadnt worried about was racial tension even though many white girls come to basic training from the south we all try to talk to each other and cheer each other up doris said exclaimed a negro girl in her third week of basic racial prejudice if it s there i cant worry about it honey im too busy just trying to survive the administrator in charge of basic training lt col mary e clark smiles on hearing the tribulations of a new recruit she has heard them a thousand times before she says our primary problem with the girls is homesickness and then they have so many misconceptions about the army such as prisons for women thats ridiculous in eight weeks the girls must learn all there is to know about the army so we keep them going from day to day with classes inspection and drill sure its tough but we explain why things must be done the army way and no other way why they must avoid getting too many gigs demerits not only are there courses in general military subjects field training and physical training but the girls must also know their militarv courtesies and duties and this makes for a verv busy eight weeks outside her barracks not far from col clarks office a short recruit struggled witli an oversize garbage pail she didnt have time to discuss her experiences for at the moment she was lugging a barrel down the sidewalk sweat pouring from her brow she panted all i can say right now is that its very very hard i hope i can make it thats all i can say but basic training is only the first step in the progress of military indoctrination if a girl does make it and in the army about per cent do she will then face eight to twelve more weeks of specialized training before assignment to her first job as a private or seaman on the other hand officer candidates and nurses in all serv ices follow a different pattern and upon completion of their own initial training they receive a commission as an ensign or first or second lieutenant the strict discipline onthejob training and advanced individual training schools usually apply only to the enlisted womens program graduation from basic training or boot camp as they say in the navy and marines is a big day it can mean the freedom to spend offduty hours as one pleases the luxiuy of a cube a room in a partitioned barracks the relaxation from daily inspections and the pleasure of being able to date men or even to marrv the dating life according to many negio service girls is very nice indeed one wwe exclaimed happily the ratio of men to women is to one and once youre out of boot camp you can date and party every night as long as youre on duty the next morning at the right time the ratio is even better when one compares the relatively few numbers of negro service girls to the large number of black soldiers at the great lakes naval training center ill a group of negro waves stimulated the attentions of almost every black marine and sailor they passed cars stopped men came to ofibce windows and numerous dating offers were made if a girl does marry after basic training the service will try to give her a compassionate assignment on a post or base with her husband however most girls prefer to wait until theyve served a year on a base before they marry they say that before then transfer is almost impossible when a woman becomes pregnant all services grant automatic discharge although col jeanne holm director of the women in the air force says i foresee a time when a woman can have a child and take a leave of absence before returning to the service after all why not this happens in civilian life and could work in the military in addition to the opportunities of dating and marrying the womens armed forces enjoy frequent travel one month annual paid leave subsidized education programs and full veterans benefits a woman must volunteer for overseas duty which in all sericcs is a coveted prize given for exceptional work or recnlistment many negro girls express more interest in educational benefits than travel most girls can qualify to continue or start their college education while in the service and pensive traineei wearing an afro and the amiband of a chosen platoon leader listens to question in map reading class negro girls in all seriees say they may wear their hair natural but claim its often difficult to find competent stylists pay only per cent of the tuition a woman may be able to take a leave of absence for several years to earn her degree and receive full pay although some of these programs incur further years of military obligation an enlisted woman may not only complete college but may also become eligible for officers candidate school even if she decides to bypass the militarys numerous tuition aid programs she qualifies for the gi bill after her discharge and will receive a preferential rating in the civil service mthough approximately per cent of all girls in the army extend their tours of duty they will admit that the service is not for everyone girls counsel prospective recruits you cant be a mamas girl you have to accept orders or you cant be snooty or oversensitive about your raceyou have to live with all kinds of folks most women in uniform share a strong pride and esprit de corps many feel that military pay and career opportunities compare favorably with civilian life and that by serving their country they are part of a select and highlyproficient sorority enlisted women and officers point out that the armed forces does not accept every applicant and sometimes takes only one in three or even one in ten said one enlisted negro girl some of my friends thought i was a square to join the service but i know i can go as far as i want in the military its up to me what i accomplish i think its the best job ive ever had m ayve you ever dreamed of being ensconced in a plush hotel on a tropical island with pckrkets

all the fighting we want in aietnam black reenlistment in the annecl forces the percentage of which is more than twice as high as that of whites is at once a source of pride for some and an alarming phenomenon to others in the years some per cent of blacks eligible for discharge from the army the branch where the reenlistment rate is highest elected to again take the oath of the american fighting man instead of returning to civilian life the percentage of whites eligible for discharge who volunteered to continue anny life during that same period was a comparatively low per cent many observers incliding some civil_rights leaders agree with columnist roscoe dnimmond that there could be no more conclusive evidence that negroes find the u s armed forces just about the most productive rewarding and racially congenial experience that they can have than the high rate of negro reenlistment dnimmond contends that the main reason for the high rate is imdenstood by every negro in service and it is that the anned forces whether vvdthin the united states or anywhere in the world represent the most completely integrated successfully integrated segment of american society critics of the concept of integration based on equality with the white man in predominantly w hite institutions say that this successfully integrated venture is negative in its effect on the black community they point for example to vietnam where blacks comprise nearly per cent of the armys combat units and suffer per cent of the deaths among enlisted men theres a common reason why negroes volunteer for the service and then reenlist said sp victor hall speaking out in a new york times magazine article the army and the negro the units in yetnam where those guys are dying are almost all volunteer units like the airborne that means they asked to go there or at least they asked to be put into a combat outfit and they wound up there thev did that for the same reason did it and for the same reasons most of the negroes here fort bragg n c did it they did it because you get incentive pay in the airborne and the promotions are better in a combat unit concluded reenlistee hall an eightyear veteran paratrooper theres a dire need for money in most negro cases another paratrooper sgt gharles donald a family man witli three children confides that he volunteered for jump duty because of the extra per month and because it was the elite part of the service gontinued donald and i reenlisted for six more years because the job opportunities outside just werent that good the army is taking care of me and my family in virtually every case reenlistment is on the conscious level a matter of dollars and cents this fact also is integral to columnist joseph alsops observation that the other large easily identifiable group in the new army is composed of white southerners from poor families so long as we see high proportionate reenlistment among blacks for economic reasons it is less the measure of their patriotism than an indictment of the country says dr charles v hamilton chairman of the political science dept at roosevelt university economics aside psychiatrist alvin f poussaint notes the psychological dynamicswhat might be called unconscious motivesat work in the phenomenon of black reenlistment domestic life that president truman ordered for them in military life years ago disproportionate reenlistment among blacks corresponds in a word with disproportionate poverty in the nations black unemployment rate was per cent while for tlie white population it was per cent some per cent of black males age an age bracket that accounts for a high percentage of armed forces reenlistees were according to the depintment of labor unemployed in the civilian labor force ordinarily military careers are not considered advantageous in economic terms however given the depressionlike conditions under which blacks live and the fact tliat salaries provided under the uniformed services pay act have escalated along with the war in vietnam the traditional jokes about a soldiers pay are invalid as reflections of the modem day the defense department has become the worlds largest business and its riflecarrying employes are by no means the countrys poorest citizens a single man who attains the grade e on his initial threeyear enlistment which is par for the course can expect to take home approximately a week with no expenses for room board clothing or medical and dental services married soldiers receive additional allow black men in general particularly from the low socioeconomic groups and particularly in the south suffer from a low selfesteem because of racism in american society the black male has also been castrated by the society and has always struggled for a sense of manhood and identity in a white world because of the limited opportunities that a racist society allows the black man for achieving manhood i think many young black men gravitate to the army to prove they are men by risking their lives in combat superior prowess in combat is one of the most primitive ways of achieving a sense of manhood the black man in combat is ready to trade his life for psychological manhood status and selfesteem in its appeal to both conscious and unconscious needs the military as a career for impoverished blacks has a magnetic quality not unlike that of prizefighting earlier in the century it has become in spite of its apparent dangers a means of escaping poverty and asserting ones self for thousands of young blacks who otherwise would have to take their chances in a labor market marked by increased automation and union discrimination gene grove author of the army and the negro notes that statistics on black reenlistment measure more than anything else the failure of the united states to offer negroes the equality in ances for subsistence and quarters five years ago a gl of the same rank could expect to net only about a week wliich fact suggests that war for men willing to risk their lives as well as the militaryindustrial complex is a profitmaking business moreover another influential factor seldom made known in published statistics on black reenlistrnent is the reenlistment bonus a gl reenlisting for the first time receives anywhere from a to a cash bonus in the words of one air force reenlistee thats an awful lot of money to a young black cat whos never had more than at one time in his life the pitch a young man receives upon walking into an armed forces recruiting office has nothing to do witli patriotism or loyalty it is plainly and simply an ecxnomic pitch and when gis are interviewed prior to discharge relative to their intentions the reenlistment pitch used by the interiewer is not dissimilar to that used by personnel men in civilian life in trying to persuade a man to stay with the company the man is presented with the benefits and economic advantages of staying with the organization as one black gl recalls tliey just told me point blank that i couldnt make it on the outside it is pertinent to observe also that white servicemen are more likely than blacks to obtain a skill in the military that is in demand in civilian life in a book published this year integration of the negro in the u s armed forcesy richard j stillman ii points out that in enlisted job occupations negroes are concentrated heavily in unskilled or semiskilled occupations stillman s research reveals disproportionate black representation in the armys infantry the navys food service and in service and supply work such as tmek drivers commissary clerks and military policemen fewer are in the growing skill fields of electronics communications and mechanical repair writes the author stillmans research speaks again to the failure of civilian society to educate black youtli however some critics believe that the anny should revise the testing process through which the individual soldier qualifies for specific training the armed forces qualification test has been described by sociologist donald f hueber as a measure of the individuals participation in the culture as well as a measure of innate ability in this case the culture rellected in the test is white and the assumption is that a black man who hasnt mastered white culture cannot for example learn how to repair machinery thus he is more likely to become an infantryman more fikely to volunteer for dangerous duty and more likely to reenlist because the skills of a man trained to be a killer are in small demand in the world it is not necessarily an endorsement of the armed forces or its successful integration says dr hamilton when a black gi such as sgt clide brown jr an unskilled laborer from alabama who became a team leader in vietnam calls the army a good job says hamilton it only proves that all this talk and all these programs havent brought the nation to the point where young black men are willing to take a chance in american society its a sad commentary on the state of the country that a man will subject himself to possible death in order to be quasiintegrated paratrooper brown says that the army gives one a chance to work with people and be a leader he added in a time magazine interview whats more any paratrooper can whip five legs nonparatroopers in a nation that has of late been calling attention to its own violence historic and present the army notes dr poussaint provides legitimate means by which young men can express aggression anger and destructive impulses a young mans anger and aggression are thus legitimized by the army and does not become asocial american society has gone to great lengths to suppress the just anger and rage in black people in the army that rage is not merely made legitimate observes poussaint but is directed not at the white oppressor but at the enemv but there is evidence that soldiers black and white like the nation in general have begun to ask the question who is the enemy reenlistment rates among black and white in each branch of the armed forces dropped last year from the preceding year the most severe decrease occurring in the army however een though black reenlistment in the army dropped from per cent in to per cent in the blackwhite ratio grew barely less dramatic the white rate dropped from per cent to per cent thus while one in eight whites remained voluntarily in the military one out of eer three blacks did so reenlistment rates in other branches of the armed forces in were as follows air force black per cent white per cent navy black per cent white per cent marine corps black per cent white per cent a defense department spokesman obsen ed that such drops as that in army reenlistment are not abnormal as a war progresses although the department offered no explanation for the black reenlistment rate dropping more sharply than the whiteand reportedly plans to conduct a study in that regardit is hardly a secret that in the war in vietnam became more controversial in the black commnnitv than during any previous year this according to most obserers was the direct result of prestige given the antiwar inoement by the voice of the late martin_luther_king notwithstanding the lamentations of handpicked black soldiers frequently quoted in the popular press cixilians have long accused career military men of taking the easy way out for a great number of blacks in their quest for manhood in the countiy of their birth the surest way to make a buck and be somebody has been to become an american fighting man they are the descendents

current crop of black comedians if some familiar names are allotted little space or are omitted altogether believe us it is with good reason and much regret richard pryor depends more upon delivery and facial expressions for instance than the written script flip wilson and godfrey cambridge seldom employ war themes lets face it vietnam is an unpopular unfunny war i was captured on the moniing of july in the southemniost part of south vietnam while on patrol with a strike force unit of south vietnamese to which i had been attached as a medical advisor our patrol was ambushed and after quite a firefight in which i was wounded on the ankle i was taken prisoner i was the only american captured along with some south vietnamese since i couldnt walk because of my injury i expected to be shot on the spot but instead my captors dragged me away from the immediate battle area i was beaten and kicked and generally treated quite rough at first i was taken to a small village and from there after dark fell i was moved to a vietnamese pow camp for interrogation it was early morning when i arrived there anvay after midnight the interrogation started soon after daybreak the methods need not be described all i can say is that it was quite agonizing despite my condition i was given no first aid my medical kit had already been taken away from me so i couldnt patch myself up after the abortive interrogation session i was tied to a stake and it became quite clear to me that i was being set up for execution because the other prisoners were herded away and the viet cong brass began to gather nearby at that time they didnt know that i could speak and understand vietnamese so they didnt know that i was overhearing everything when after several months i finally did start speaking i made it appear as if i was learning the language i did this in order to assure my own survival it made it possible for me to ask for certain types of medicine or for more food and generally be better infonned about what was going on around me there was an old vietnameseyou might call him a village elder to whom i had given some medical aid before my medical kit had been taken from me just at the time when my execution was to take place this old man appeared and pleaded with my captors not to shoot me the vietnamese have a great respect for old people especially village elders so they cancelled their exccution plansat least for the men to hear their side of the story or to ascertain the state of their mental condition following such contact robert j mccloskey press officer for the state dept hastened to acquit the serfeants of the brainwash charge with these words on the basis of our talks with these men the three sergeants it seems clear that the men withstood their long ordeal with great courage and intelligence j meanwhile returned to light duty at ft bragg n c after a period of convalescence one member of the trio sgt jackson of talcott w va a green beret medic told the story of his month ordeal at the hands of the viet cong to ebony managing editor hans j assaquoi much of what he experienced is still shrouded in military secrecy by orders of his superiors the following is an exclusive report on what he was able to tell without violating security moment i still wasnt sure they wouldnt change their minds later tliis was a feeling that haunted me throughout my month imirisonment for some time i remained in this vietnamese pow camp eventually i was moved to another camp that contained americans with no vietnamese prisoners being in the company of other americans definitely lifted my spirit but i still couldnt make myself believe that i was actually captured that i was actually in the hands of the viet cong it took me a long time to get used to that thought for quite a while i kept expecting something to happen some day somehow i would make a break or uncle sam would do something initiate some action that would get me out but as time went on stopped hoping the first thing i wanted to do was find out as much as possible about the situation that i was in and what was expected to happen to me this was difficult to do because at this time i was not supposed to have any contact with the other prisoners there were times when i was shackled and there were times when i was allowed to walk around free of course always under heavy guard my shackles consisted of two ushaped anklets which fit over the ankles to the rear of each anklet there was an eyelet through which slides a bara cylindrical bar which was being locked to some stationary object usually i would be shackled at night if my captors had any physical means of holding me like locking a dxr to a hut then id be unshackled but at night the shackles went back on since i was developing an awful skin fungus wearing those shackles was quite painful but just as bad as the pain was the discomfort of having my limbs restricted it is supposed to take a while to get used to it i never did only being able to sit in one position without being able to change is quite aggravating an effective method the enemy employs to get a prisoner into the frame of mind in which he wants him and to lower his resistance is isolation being isolated from others a person has nothing concrete to hold on to no feeling of security it totally disorients him there were periods when i tried to remember what time had elapsed in terms of days but i would gradually lose track i think a prisoners worst enemy particularly in isolation is himself he gets himself into a certain desiderate frame of mind and before long one thing brings on another before he knows it why he doesnt have anything to hold on to mentally shortly after capture he can still pass off some of that informa up a plan of how to become a millionaire by the time i reached then i got hold of this stick about inches long and three inches in diameter and started carving the months of my imprisonment into it with a razor blade i reached the point where i looked forward to the end of the month so i cmild start working on this thing again i never worked on it until the next month had arrived so id ha e something to do the viet cong didnt know what to make of it some of them took it away from me for a while saying that it was a weapon but they would always give it back to me perhaps because they thought that it was quite artistic and because i had told them that it had something to do with my religion periodically they would let me have paper and pencil so i made myself a calendar once they even let me write a letter home but the letter was never delivered i didnt find that out until i returned home but i had suspected it all along when they offered a second time to let me write i refused i figured that my family probably thought that i was dead and that if i would write them today and the next week i got killed in a u s air strike they would have to go through the whole thing again at times when i reached a point where i had nothing else to hold on to psychologically i would pray this brings to my mind an incident that happened during one of those interrogation sessions the treatment i had been getting had been quite painful so i started praying in effect what i said to god was that i still thought that i could make it a little while longer but that i just wanted to be in contact with him if the need should arise wlien i got through praying i suddenly started laughing because i remembered that i had often come on the field radio like that many times i would check the radio saying okay this is me i dont need you guys yet but i might get into something a little later i just want to know that you are there the similarity of that situation and my prayer crossed my mind thats why i laughed anyway my laughing shook my interrogators so much they cut me loose at once they stopped the whole proceedings at that point though i cant be sure maybe i did get a little help from above another time during interrogation i was wondering how much longer i could hold out on this thing and just like this it struck me that i didnt have to go through what i was going through so all of a sudden i blacked out my consciousness i just blacked out alter that i did this quite a few times sometimes i would fake unconsciousness and some times i would really black out eventually i found that i prominent members of peace that nejiotiatctl release of prisoners via czech joan baez and tom hayden a rights activist said dr_king at the time of tlie mens could turn off my consciousness almost at will the only problems i had was turning it back on to reality it is hard to tell whether i would have received better treatment from the tet cong if had cooperated with them during interrogation it has been proven that if you cooperate and give them something they are after they want that much more the next time one thing that was constantly slapped in my face was the race situation in the united states it was initially used to win me over without applying any of the other more drastic methods they had they tried the nice way first they definitely tried to make me feel that my race would put me in line for special privileges but i could readily see that they were only making promises all i had to do was look around me and see in what miserable shape the other negro prisoners were in first of all they wanted to know why the american negro wanted to come to vietnam why did he allow himself to be sent to vietnam they would ask me whether it is true that negroes in america dont go to school whether all negroes are poor some wanted to know whether there were any negro officers in the united states rmy youd be surprised at how many people i ran into over there who told me that there were no negro officers in the u s army these were people who were supposed to be wellinformed they even went so far as to remind me that black leaderslike malcolm_xwere being assassinated back home they told me that negroes were getting machinegunned in the streets of america and that newark and all those places had blown up in addition to all this they had me listen to radio hanoi and another clandestine guerrilla radio station in the south so i heard constant news about all the tlack revolutions happening in the united states i knew that there was unrest and i knew that there was trouble but as far as negroes being machinegunned in the streets and my family being in terrible trouble back home was concerned all this i knew wasnt true the whole thing was blown so far out of proportion as it was presented to me i just had to write it off as being untrue at one time i listened to a broadcast made by stokely carmichael i think it was made while he was visiting hanoi it was beamed from there to the negro soldier in south vietnam his whole line was why are you here fighting you should be back in solidarity with the i think it was the afroasian solidarity conference or something to that effect they were having there representatives of bertrand russells war crimes committee were in hanoi at the same time to investigate alleged u s atrocities in vietnam they later used their findings in the war criminals trial in europe of president johnson and former sect of defense robert mcnamara and all these people i also listened to recordings that i assume had been recorded in the united states by negro groups and sent to both south and north vietnam they were aired in minute broadcasts over the radio i wont say that they didnt make me and some of the other negro prisoners think but i dont think that they had much of a demoralizing effect on us if a prisoner was to be demoralized many things contributed to it rather than just listening to a radio broadcast a much more demoralizing situation we prisoners faced was the general lack of sanitationthe leeches that covered our body after each use of the swamp latrines the mosquitoes flies and other insects that llagued us day and niglit and above all the rice and fish diet on which we had to survive and which we sometimes supplemented with a fat rat or snake we were able to catch the amount of rice an american has to eat just to give him enough strength to barely move is enormous compared with the amount an asian needs we were being fed once or twice a day during that time we had to stuflf down so much rice till it was almost coming out of our ears after several months of this some of the prisoners just couldnt take any more and refused to eat rice but the problem was that if they stopped eating rice they would face starvation the first month of my imprisonment i was still in fairly good physical shape starting with the second month i had bouts with dysentery a nasty thing that weakened me to the point where i didnt have tli strength to move this was a chronic thing that occurred off and on throughout the time i was there since i had no drugs to combat the disease my condition grew progressively worse to make matters worse i stopped eating riceas long as seven days as a result i reached a state of complete helplessness i couldnt walk any more or even turn over my weight which before my capture was around to pounds dropped to pounds when i reached that point i had completely written myself off i just said to hell with it all i thought i would just lie down and die but i soon found out that it wasnt as easy as i had expected because i had all those terrible aches and pains being a medic i have quite an extensive knowledge of anatomy and physiology so i checked myself out for any signs of approaching death but to my disappointment everything kept pumping right along so i kept waiting some more for the signs to come but while my pains grew worse the signs never came so after about a week i made up my mind to start eating rice again what really changed my mind was the thought of the burden that i had been putting on my fellow prisoners who had to care for meclean me up and give me waterwhile i was in this helpless state i still remember christmas that year they gave us permission to celebrate but we were in no mood to celebrate because one of our buddies was dying you would always know in advance when prisoners were about to die it seemed that the light would go out of tlieir eyes and you would know that after a while they would die well this man died on new years eve after that the food situation improved some they brought more food in i think it was due to that prisoners death the reason i think they botliered to keep us alive was that they could always use us for exchange for propaganda purposes and for influencing world opinion they want to be known as nice guys who are fighting a national revolution there were a few instances of sincere efforts on the part of some guards to be friendly with us but as far as the official contact with our captors was concerned they largely followed the official line all americans are bad and hate asians this thinking went down to the lowest level among the viet cong they have definite guidelines to go by as far as the treatment of prisoners is concerned i think that my statement which was widely quoted after my release that i had been treated well calls for some explanation i think that if you check back into the history of warfare youll find that no guerrillas before have ever bothered to hold prisoners they have all by the very nature of guerrillatype operations been predisposed against burdening themselves with prisoners since guerrillas have to be much on the move and have to travel light thats why i had expected to be shot on the spot at the time of my capture so bearing all this in mind i would say that i was treated as well as could be expected under the circumstances as far as the established geneva conference rules governing the treatment of pows is concerned they are definitely out as far as the enemy is concerned the viet congs dont play by the rules the news of my pending release came overnight so to speak it was a bigger surprise to me than anybody else i think at first i didnt believe it i got the first word that i would be one of three prisoners to be released from a representative of the national liberation front he mentioned to me that this american ieace committee had been instrumental in our release some of the more prominent members of that committee were dr martin_luther_king jr dr spock floyd mckissick joan baez and tom hayden why i was chosen instead of some other prisoner i still dont know at first the three of us were taken by boat across the border to neutral cambodia there we were turned over to tom hayden the peace committees official representative who boarded a czechoslovakian airliner with us the airliner w as scheduled to fly to prague via rangoon and beirut lebanon we changed planes in beirut and boarded a u sbound pan am flight which first took us to rome and paris and then to new york after that we were immediately hospitalized in washington d c where we were also debriefed by the defense dept from washington i was sent to ft bragg for further hospitalization and a reunion with my family following that i was given an extended convalescent leave i had been kept quite busy after my release so i hadnt had much time to think about my return one way or another at first had been looking for some psychomotor type letdowm some kind of reaction but it never came about so ive stopped looking for it i have observed one definite change in me though i am sure i now have quite a bit more patience than i had before my imprisonmentabout everything not to the point of being lackadaisical but to the point where i let nothing shake me my friends complain that they cant even get a good argument out of me anymore there was at first a period of extreme nervousness after say walking into a room or a public place like a restaurant i suddenly would get a feeling that id have to get up and get out for a while i would start shaking and wouldnt know why i had drugs that i could have taken but i didnt so far i still havent used them but i did drink quite a bit of alcohol for a while but i found out that tliis wasnt the answer either so i got off that too i also found that i didnt get angry any more the way i used to before anything it didnt make a damn what little thing would send me off now it takes quite a bit to make me mad overall i would say that my present disposition is a definite improvement over what it used to be before my imprisonment but i definitely wouldnt recommend the kind of cure i had to take to other people to get rid of their quick tempers all in all i would say that the experience that i gained is valuable not only to me as a person but also to the people with whom i will serve in the future as far as my plans for the future are concerned i will definitely stay in the army i have already put in years and am now going for what happens after that ill think about when the time comes t erry wlntmore is a tall slim yearold man with a cool ironic face he is a vietnam veteran and there is no reason to believe that he is not a hero though he describes himself as having been in those earlier days a fighting machine conditioned to kill kill kill yet he is also a deserter one of the brothers among u s servicemen who have chosen to take refuge in swedena neutral country on the vietnam issuerather than go on fighting like the other deserters living there wliitmore intends to learn swedish and insists that life in his adopted country is fine no discrimination lots of helpful generous people and if not paradise the next thing to it with the one possible objection being the lack of soul food now whitmore contends that he is going to devote all his energies to bahrein the marxistoriented peace organization that helped him reach neutral territory via a long and dangerous route from japan he believes there are many other brothers stationed in the far east who want to desert and should know that it is possible one recent evening ik told the story of his desertion as he sat in a small flat in the stockholm suburb of solna in the fall of terry had volunteered for the marine corps because he says i was going to be drafted anyway and this gae me a chance to stay home over christmas at that time he contends he was promised noncombat duty aboard a ship and therefore he would not have to go to vietnam but this was changedin a way he seems to consider a cheatand on july of the following summer he was sent to okinawa and eventually vietnam as whitmore remembers it wasnt bad at first just hitandrun fighting but it got worse that october the marines were moved north into the con tien area and later fought under heavy fire for days acting on information received from intelligence terrys irrrit moed out into the jungle before dawn on the morning of dec to set up an ambush by now teriy was a lance corporal a tough experienced soldier who led a fire team he and his men reached their position without incident but what they did not know was that the enemy had reached the same position some time before them in fact they hid for seven hours unknown to each other about yards adart then two of the enemy were spotted a young u s lieutenant called for fire and there was a brief cxchange he ordered terry to lay a couple of mortar rounds on some bushes on a nearbv hill then he nave orders to advance terrv savs we didnt like it i had experience i knew i hadnt hit anything thev were still around somewhere unhurt the sun was hot now almost unbearable terrys unit started to advance slowly up the hill then it broke loose they opened up with everything mortars machineguns small arms whitmore recounts everybody around me was either hit or pinned down myself i knew i couldnt hit the ground i had to run back he made it to relative safety but then he heard the injured lieutenant scream for help i rushed back says whitmore and again they shot with ev erything they had on my way i passd a vietnamese lying in a bush with a bland expression on his face he scared me but i didnt have time to do anything when i had gotten the lieutenant up onto my back i noticed the vietnamese again this time he pointed his gun in our direction he shotthe lieutenant i had to ask myself wliy didnt he shoot me was it because the lieutenant was w hite and i was not under heavy fire terrv crawled to safety with the lieutenant on his back when he had reached a point beyond the range of fire he found three white marines there ready to give them aid then suddenly he recalls there was a hail of bullets they were all cut down all except me later though whitmore was wounded and after a series of experiences that he considers too awful to tell he was flown to a hospital eventually he reached the base of cam ranh bay the day before president lyndon b johnson arrived there the man pinned medals on me whitmore says of johnson or rather not on me but on my pillow because i was so badly shot up as he lay in the hospital bed whitmore wondered why the north vietnamese had shot the whites around him at one point but not him he had long been aware of the fact that racism on the part of white americans did not disappear once they were outside the united states he had seen it in vietnam could it be that the vietnamese had seen it also could it be that they had no stomach for killing negroes more and more he came to believe that this was the heart of the matter whitmore was flowm to a hospital in japan there he recuperated and there he maintains he was cheated again the doctors said i was not going back to vietnam definitely but one day the orders were changed a japanese girlfriend tried to convince him not to leave and offered to take him into hiding he missed his flight to okinawa a couple of times mulling over his dilemma he had proven that he wasnt afraid and believed there was no good reason why he should return to the front lines he thought of his family his friends the way all brothers were being oppressed back home and wondered what kind of freedom he was fighting for anyway while hiding out in japan he was approached by a man from bahrein the organization that has come to the aid of many deserters and is considered by american authorities to be communistoperated it was the same group that had helped four young white crewmen from the uss intrepid when they had deserted the navy and fled to sweden by way of russia he asked me if i wanted out says whitmore i said ves w now a deserter the exmarine was sent along routes he will not disclose to moscow there he appeared on television denouncing the vietnam conflict as white americas war against the vietnamese at first he had been reluctant to go to the soviet union but recalls the russians were good they showed us a lot of their country cities and all and explained to us what they were trving to do maybe there were things they didnt show ns but from what i saw it was good yet for reasons he will not explain whitmore didnt want to remain in the soviet union indeed in spite of what the deserters say there is some doubt as to whether or not he would have been allowed to remain there he was offered a choice of six countries and after much thought declined the offer to go to sweden in his flatly monotonous voice he explains we had heard that the deserters in sweden were begging in the streets were hoodlums i wanted no part of that in spite of his reluctance he was given travel orders and went by air from leningrad to stockholm before his departure representatives of the soviet peace committee a powerful semiofficial organization that handles vietnam deserters had told him that he would be taken into custody on his arrival in sweden but not to be alanned tlie expected did occur but in a short time whitmore was able to make contact with the swedish peace committee it corresponds to the soviet organization and is headed by bertil swahnstrom a former foreign correspondent who also heads the swedish vietnamese committee swahnstrom arranged for whitmore to be accommodated in a youth hostel and he lay low for a while later he was able to get a fiveroom flat in a stockholm suburb and now lives well among whitmore s associates are other black deserters like jay wright a yearoid from new orleans a former staff sergeant in the air force jay joined the service when he was he had completed a oneyear tour of duty in vietnam and was back in the states when his decision became final i was sitting at my desk back in louisiana looking at bs take off and land wright recalls i realized that we were lxmbing women and children and i also remembered what i had seen over there much racial hatred against the vietnamese people on the part of the white soldiers once he had decided to desert wright contacted groups in the u s the names of which he refuses to reveal for security reasons and made his way to moscow after the moreorless routine television appearance he went to sweden his first choice he explains i felt that here in sweden i could speak out against the injustices committed against my people without fear jay got in touch with hansgdran frank a famous swedish lawyer who is quite active in vietnam matters and everything was arranged for the time being he is living in an apartment being loaned to him by two students later on he expects to get a house when asked if he plans to return to the united states if amnesty is given wright comments i am undecided at this point but i would like to be free to go anywhere including the u s this is something any human being would want for one thing i would like to be able to visit my family which i miss very much for paul f taylor a yearold native of pittsburgh pa the road to sweden led from germany where he was stationed along with his germanborn wife giesela taylor had found discrimination in the army worse than it was back home noting of his wife particularly when i started going with her giesela wholeheartedly supported his decision to desert they came by train from germany to stockholm and there met jay they now live in his small apartment often the deserters point to some of the reasons why they choose to remain in sweden having been admitted to the country on humanitarian grounds instead of coming as political exiles they are free to speak in public on political matters otherwise they would have been confined to silence the government too has been able to use them to fan the very strong antiwar feeling in the country they are given free legal help by atty frank and after having met him may attend language school for six hours a day free of charge from the everpresent swedish welfare agencies a married man like paul taylor can get an allotment of swedish crowns a month which is quite enough to get along on though not in affluence a bachelor like jay wright gets about crowns a week plus crowns a month to pay for his flat this has made some swedes envious although swedish organizations have helped them the deserters have formed their own american deserters gommittee adc to handle matters of common interest and inform the swedish public about the war it is no secret that they want more american gfs to come over herethe more the better however the negro deserters have formed their own organization the afroamerican deserters committee aadc though they work with the other groups they are not content to deal merely with the problem of vietnam don williams a yearold product of the chicago ghetto serves as cochairman of aadc and explains to us the fight is not over once there is peace in vietnam the main reasonand i can not stress this enoughfor my own defection is the injustices committed against my people in the u s i will not rest until their awful conditions have been changed the same goes says don for all the negro deserters in sweden speaking as merely one of several don proclaims that he is today all black_power and he is prepared to stay on for a long time fighting from abroad unless revolution breaks out in the u s but then man i will be on the first tiling westbound g et off the train in frankfurt germany walk along glittering kaiser strasse past the honkytonk bars and the peroxide blonde frauleins then mosev on down to the left where the lights are a little less bright the girls a little less alluring over a storefront bistro youll see a sign staling corso bar open from am youll hear the real tough beat of a soul band socking it out and if you walk inside youll see that everybodys face is blackeverybody except the manager and his bevy of notsobeautiful bgirls take a seat next to the negro sergeant at the comer table shoot the breeze with him a while and ask him if germany has nothing better to offer than this crummy joint it sure aint much he smiles but its ours youve arrived in the verv heart of gi ger many and in a curious way ou will have stumbled across the kev to the black soldiers situation there today because the mediocrity of the corso bar where three men have died violently in the last three years stands as a symbol of the everpresent secondbestin bars in girls in offpost housingthat a black u s serviceman often finds he has to settle for in germany the most frequently voiced complaint says l howard bennett the defense depart merits negro director of civil_rights is complete segregation in many cases of bars over there whites do not go into a negrofrequented bar and vice versa without friction why docs the black soldier make a place like the corso his steady hangout rather than venture out of the minighetto simple explains sp robert walker a mail clerk stationed in nearby bad kreuznach i want more for my people but im not going into a place where i know im not wanted not wanted even though years have elapsed since wdien germans first encountered night fighters black gis in large numbers places remain where the negro trooper is not wanted why mainly because the wdiite man brings his prejudiced opinions wnth him from the states and brainwashes the people here says ssgt donald potter a signal corps nco noncommissioned officer from kaiserslautern its a bad scene like when you work with a white buddy all day then go donmtown for a few drinks and he goes one way and you go the other ironically in the same two decades the negro soldier has won full integration in the service risen in the ranks and earned many top staff and command positions in usareuru s army europe men like lt col henry cody who until recently commanded the american forces network our radio voice in europe col willard c stewart a top inspector general troubleshooter for army headquarters in heidelberg lt col grover a du bose an artillery battalion commander in darmstadt or lt col willie jones provost marshal of actionpacked hanau the estimated black gis and officers presently in europe are victimized by a wide range of moraledestroying unpleasantness onand offbase in recent years many sensational stories have been published running the gamut from kidstuff namecalling in the barracks to kkkstyle cross burnings and harassment to apparent inequities in the administration of military justice to the flat refusal of most german landlords to rent the negro an apartment for his family among the cases are these a soldier named bobbie lee pace assigned to a medical battalion in augsburg was discovered to be the american nazi partys leading representative in europe he was exposed by the overseas weekly a privatelyowned newspaper for gis despite the exposure he was promoted to sp finally when the newspaper reported the promotion too the confessed fuehrerlover was suddenly transferred to the states but with his new stripe still on his sleeve pace his unembarrassed commander explained was promoted because he was a good soldier who kept his racial theories separate from his duties said a disgusted negro officer i wonder if that same commander would have promoted pace if he had been a black muslim rather than a nazi in wildflecken two negro sergeants were driving past the post fire house when a laughing figure emerged wearing a white robe and pointed hood of a ku klux klansman apprehended by the ncos the night rider and three fellow jokers were rebuked for the stunt in schwetzingen four white wacs turned down negro troopers who asked them for danees at a service club party raising tensions so high the affair had to close up early problems often arise when managers of enlisted mens clubs create automatic segregation by using either soul or hillbilly bands exclusively in one such club recently a highranking commander decided to break up the predominantly black patronage by ordering the managers to switch from soul to country and western he reneged when a group of brothers let it be known theyd bum the place down if soul was banished i there are frequent but so far undocumented rumors of negroes being shipped to boondocks units to get them out of big cities like frankfurt stuttgart and nuraberg and there are other seemingly minor incidents hard to pinpoint as overt prejudicethe kind of thing white artilleryman sp thomas hasbany of gelnhausen means when he says my section chief is a negro and a great guy hes been promised promotions a million times but keeps getting passed over most commanders seem to look dowm on negroes in one way or another like im sure if i was on a bad detail with a negro hed get the worse end of the stick i guess thats why negroes stick together the housing situation is even more revealing unfortunately reports frankfurt real estate agent wilfried vollmerhaus quite a few german landlords are difficult to deal with when i bring a negro client recently many of them have told me they are scared by the image they get of the negro from newspaper stories about the stateside riots but it goes deeper than that said vollmerhaus at least percent of the landlords who want me to find them a tenant say no colored please i tell them you could have been bom colored too then they always say it isnt me personally id be happy to give them their civil_rights but my neighbors would object to a negro the situation becomes even more critical said the agent when an interracial marriage is involved tlie reason for housing discrimination is not the german but the american says one angry negro officer a german landlord told me he could care less but hes got american families here and they might not like it tliey want their lily white meccas over here too probably the classic example of the housing problem in germany was the widelypublicized case of pfc elvin williams a yearold negro soldier who badly needed housing for his puerto rican wife and baby but ran into medieval superstition on every try the german women who lived in tlie house believed their babies would be born colored if a negro lives in the same building recalled a friend another common objection landlords fear the color will rub off on their bed linen tragically ironic while williams desperately sought housing in germany his yearold brother frederick died of wounds suffered fighting the communists half a world away in vietnam many of these problems could be solved in the opinion of one young negro officer if usareur commanderinchief gen james h polk would decide to get tough and request pentagon permission to use offlimits sanctions against discriminatory landlords as it stands now a landlord reported for rejecting a negro tenant is taken off official army housing lists but this a joke said the officer because all the landlord has to do is slip the armys german employee marks and a white soldier will be sent to him through the back door what about black gis who get into legal trouble in theoryand to a large degree in practicethe black soldier gets the same break his white buddy gets if arraigned before a toplevel general court martial for a serious oflfense he has qualified military counsel available at no cost and he can pick from a growing number of black judge advocate attorneys for a fee he can retain a civilian lawyer like edward j bellen of frankfort who defends more black servicemen than whtes but there are inequities at one army division headquarters of soldiers tried by general court martial in a oneyear period were black at the same outfit oldtimers could not recall when a black officer had been appointed to the jury with a predominantly white court says one prominent military lawyer the negro is generally at a disadvantage a guy walks in the courtroom walking his soul walk and talking his soul talk and its three strikes against him already he may know his weapon better than any white boy in the platoon but you get some kentucky colonel on the board and he automatically figures hes a bum for this reason too the attorney said it is especially difficult to defend a negro soldier in say a elimination proceeding where there are no rules of evidence anyway many of the officers who sit on courts and boards says the lawyer bring their prejudice with them what they really resent is that they cant create middlesburg usa in their units so its unrealistic to tjlink this same bird is going to come on a board and all of a sudden be a model of objectivity look he said a negro gi is accused of raping a german prostitute ok i admit a prostitute can be raped but even if evidence shows she was willing some court members will vote to convict just because they cant see a negro trooper sleeping with a white woman one fact undisputed by either blacks whites or the military power structure is that many black soldiers in the stockade feel they have been given a legalized shafting because of their race we often hear complaints that a negro soldier believes he has received an article or court martial for an offense that a white soldier would only have been slapped on the wrist for says maj harry fancher of tlie usareur judge advocate division it is bad that many people believe this and it hurts the annys image to counteract the rumors and get to the root of such complaints usareur has assigned black lawyer capt curtis smothers as a trouble shooter on each such complaint smothers visits the prisoner concerned shows him that somebody cares and occasionally manages to correct injustices i guess the command has realized that i can get to these men in a way they cant says smother a yearold georgetown university law school graduate but says fancher most of the time there is no validity to complaints of racial inequity in the military justice system col stewart the inspector general troubleshooter tends to agree unfortunately the colored soldier bases his complaints on his race too frequently he uses it as a crutch stewart believes this accounts for many of the black stockade inmates who refuse rehabilitation opportunities and actively seek less than honorable discharges saying i want out of this white mans army black and white soldiers accused of crimes in german courts generally receive equal treatment but it is perhaps significant that the only u s soldier so far sentenced to life in a gcnnan penitentiary was black pvt carter brown who was locked up for the slaying of a popular frankfurt cab driver browns white accomplice was tried as a juvenile and received only four years in reform school for the killing after the murder frankfurt cab drivers were observed turning away black gi fares while accepting white soldiers frequently too german defense lawyers will base their courtroom tactics on purely racial arguments claiming that the black defendants hot and primitive temper was the cause of his crime of violence such an approach would probably be grounds for a mistrial in a u s vrmy court martial in the eyes of usareur provost marshal brig gen harley moore the armys top cop in europe the black soldier is no better and no worse behaved than the caucasian even in narcotics offenses which were predominantly black five years ago the black gi today presents no bigger problem than the white still there is a curious imbalance in stockade populations out of inmates currently locked up in usareurs seven stockades or about hvo out of fiveare black in one stockade mannheim a brawl broke out following the assassination of dr martin_luther_king jr we had a white prisoner open up his damned trap and make a racial remark explains moore he got decked by a negro and the thing spread this boy was a real jewel what an idiotic thing to say especially in a time of tension like that you know the single big factor in sparking racial trouble over here is a loose lip perhaps but lets take a look at gi attitudes on whether the army is living up to its muchpublicized goals of complete racial equality there are two main views from two radically different kinds of negro soldiers one is that of the oldtimer the man who began lus career in the segregated army fought hard to get where he is and has personally seen the ast improvement already made he feels like col stewart that the army has done better than any other segment of american society to banish discriminatory practices the other is that of the young impatient newcomer more concerned with fast change than past accomplishments like one black officer who requested to be identified only as captain x who will bitterly tell you its still chucks army in its efforts to pat itself on the back for progress says captain x the army tends to overlook obvious tensions problem no is that tlie ai my wont admit its got a problem if you dont face the problem you dont solve it sure they like to have prominent negroes around it puts salve on the conscience he says but the army only goes so far in assigning negroes to token positions so that it does not present a positive threat examples negro soldiers progress rapidly to e and e nco grades but too rarely make it into the first sergeant and sergeant major grades if theyve got the talent to get that far i wonder why they dont go all the way socially too there are problems it would be death on a negro officer to come into the heidelberg officers club with a fraulein the captain says youd have to be out of your mind some people just cant stand to sec a soul brother with a fraulein i have a negro officer friend with a german girl do you know something they dont come out by day such a view says year veteran stewart is keeping your eye on the hole and not on the donut this officer doesnt remember when we couldnt even use the post swimming pool or the officers club i do i was the first negro to join the fort benning ga officers club this mans got it smooth because guys like me have been getting knocked around for hventy years in i could practically count the munber of negro field grade officers on my fingers and toes today i cant even tell you how many are in my headquarters stewart feels that the policy on equal opportunity in the army as outlined in army regulations is perfect you just cannot challenge it it breaks down occasionally because of the human element the number of soldiers who hold to the old philosophies and concepts is rapidly diminishing said stewart i think the army has made it ery dangerous for one of these people to express a holdtheline segregationist viewpoint he might as well kiss his career goodbye the next step stewart says is for the commander at all levels to stand up and be counted starting with the platoon leader he has to be identified as supporting the policy and white and colored have to know it the progress the anny has made is great with my educational preparation i dont think i would have reached a position equal to colonel in civilian life and i can predict that in the next years the army will be clean of antebellum tqes but of course for some of us thats not fast enough now two strange new things are happening in gi germany things that may support the official optimism one is the negro soldiers new assertive attitude his refusal to take abuse without appealing to lawmakers newspapers or the armys own internal gripe channel operated by insector generals like stewart the second is the fact that more and more white troopers in germany arc ready to stand up and be counted with the negro in his fight for dignity typical was a development at the th military police gompany in bad kreuznach where it was revealed largely by disturbed white buddiesthat negro soldiers were being forced to take racial insults and abuse from the white officers and ngos im white myself wrote pfc james wcstcrfield jr in a disgusted complaint to the inspector general but if im in the army helping to keep freedom in the world then negroes should htive the same rights and be allowed to live without ridicule and not be ashamed because their skin is a different shade with information from men like westerfield the army moved fast transferring at least one officer and rebuking ngos moskowitz and bennett apparently noted the same trend in talking with soldiers here about racial difficulties this spring for everywhere they went gaucasians came along to back up their negro fellowsoldiers allegations the message hasnt been lost on guys like sgt ronald walker a mortar squad leader from friedberg says walker if a white soui brother comes into one of our bars hell be accepted witli no problem thats part of soul itself this is a new attitude in gi germanynew and hopeful unfortunately many problems remain t here are admirals and generals in the u s military but only two are negro that is to say the nations top brass is per cent integrated the flesh and blood of this statistical oddity are brig gen frederic e davison nominated to his new rank only in july and graying yearld lt gen benjamin o davis before switching irom full command of the th air force in the philppines to deputy command of macdill air force base fla this summer gen davis granted an interview to a newsman loaded with questions about alleged integration in the military it was a rare concession for the general never a racial reformer he had distinguished himself as a brilliant military administrator war hero and professional soldier his years in uniform had con inced him that negro servicemen fare belter than negro civilians during his interview however he was caieful not to conclude from his lofty position as the armed forces highest ranking negro that all its racial problems were solved when you get right down to it he admitted the armed forces are composed of americans and putting on a uniform doesnt eactly change completely the type of person one was before having said in effect that civilian and inilitarv america are the outside and inside of the same bag the threestar general nevertheless was confident that on paper and policywisc there was absolutely no reason why other negroes could not also rise to high rank underlying his absolute was the familiar claim of the military that it is the least racist of american institutions as if it really made a difference whether the pot was indeed blacker than the kettle general davis contradictory comments skirted the stubborn fact that negroes above the grade of junior officer are rare birds as rare indeed as negro civilians with positions of power in white america never has there been a negro admiral in the nations year history and davis himself was only the second negro general his father was the first the route to being a general officer is long and complicated explains one pentagon official competition is prett vigorous it en compasses a period of time which averages years of service last year for instance only officers were promoted to brigadier general from more than colonels who were eligible yet sheer chance if nothing else should have produced dozens of admirals and generals from the thousands of negroes today who have served in two centuries of american wars but until harry trimans desegregation order years ago they were on paper and policywise secondclass warriors mirror images of their secondclass civilian brothers even if tokenism is generally far less true today generals davis and davison nonetheless are showpieces glittering exceptions proving the rule that genuine integration is far more a fact in the lowly foxholes than in the high commands of the military the peculiarity of their positions has generated some peculiar responses in his office at the pentagon army col robert a mcdade recalls somebody suggested weve getting so much flack because the air force has a negro general we ought to just pick one and make him a general then we could say we have one too i hate to see that even considered ips demeaning to the man and demeaning to the whole purpose of making one societyjust putting somebody up there to take pictures of ironically within tvo weeks after these observations president johnson nominated the armys second negro general while general davis is the most conspicuous example of token integration in the military he by no means stands alone for of tlie more than x officers in the military only are negro that is to say the entire officer corps is only about two per cent integrated all sorts of reasons are offered by military spokesmen for these embarrassingly sparse totals some lament the low number of negro college graduates which in turn reduces the numbers eligible for officer commissions other give the instant negro explanation bemoaning fierce competition from business firms able to outbid the armed forces for college graduates then there is pressure from parents in the typical middleclass home in they ranked the military only seventh among professions they wished their sons to follow a black army lieutenant colonel whose name shall remain anonymous even candidly admits that he not only would not urge his sons to follow him into the military but if he had to repeat his professional career he would not and there is pressure from campus militants whose hellnowewontgo campaign against negroes entering the armed forces crested recently in demands for the elimination of college kotc units the chief source of negro officers despite such opposition all of the services are actively seeking negroes for reserveofficer training programs and for admission to the military academies their efforts have amounted to a spasm of integration they have integrated their recruiting posters with negroes in officer uniforms integ ated their recruiting sales pitch integrated their advertisements in communications media they talk proudly of increasing integration at the senice academies although this years combined enrollment of negroes among the cadets at west point nnapolis and the air force academy is hardly evidence of a successful sixyear campaign they are eloquent about the longterm benefits of an officers career the opportunities for travel like to such exotic places as vietnam the exposure of more challenges the satisfaction that comes from being a kingpin among men but these inducements for negroes to become military officers are like sugar cubes taken with turpentine for a bad cold they do not eliminate the bad taste they merely make it seem more palatable for there is no sugaring over the bitter fact that only negro military officers have been promoted to senior rank captain and above in the navy full colonel in the other services only seven have graduated from the armed forces six schools specifically designed to train senior officers one of them was general davis who in became the first negro to attend the air war college another was gen frederic e davison presently deputy commander of an infantry brigade in vietnam and the first ntgro officer to enter the army war college in both captain samuel l graely skipper of the uss taussig and lt coindr george i thompson an exdestroyer commander attended the naval war college from to their attendance at these schools for senior officers was important not merely educationally but also because it is here that ambitious officers meet future members of promotion boards since there is stiff competition for promotion in grades above major because of the world war ii hump of officers still on active duty the friendships students form at these schools can prove useful to their later advancement for ultimately their progress in the military pecking order depends heavily on the allwhite boards of senior officers who recommend promotions these boards look for officers who have spent a certain amount of time in troop command education and overseas staff duty it is here that negro officers are caught in a circular bind they often are not promoted because they have not had military experiences equal to their white contemporaries and they have not had sufficient experience because they have been severely limited in their staff assignments troop leadership and education if these formidable obstacles dont stop their promotions a mere photograph might promotion boards are supplied with personnel records which while not being so gauche as to disclose race include photographs of each officer suspecting something less than totally objective promotion procedures a presidential committee on equal opportunity in the armed forces recommended that the services drop board use of photographs air force officials considered the proposal then concluded a photograph does not hamper a negro officers chances that in fact it might help navy officials reached similar conclusions only the army elected to eliminate the use of photographs by promotion boards whatever the merit of photographs the negroes who are army officers are nearly double the combined total of negro officers in all the other services but they are only per cent of the army officer corxt the u s navy long criticized as the slowcst of the military services to integrate only in march did it appoint its first negro caitain thomas d parham a chaplain recently commissioned the first naval rotc unit at a negro college prairie view a m in texas some officer candidates have signed up for classes opening in september the navys stepiedup efforts directed specifically to negroes have been dictated to a certain extent by pressures from within and without the pentagon last year the navy dispatched letters to schools throughout the country seeking young negroes interested in becoming naval officers and it completed more than recruitment visits to college campuses last year we know we have to change our image admits commander reeves rip taylor yearold negro chairman of a special study group in washington seeking ways to increase the negroes among the navys officers he is referring to world war ii days when per cent of negroes in the navy were messmen derisively referred to as scagoing bottle washers the question is how do you change our image commander taylor continues of course we can call all the negro naval officers together and march them up and down the street but thats kind of difficult one of the things we have done in the last year is to take as many as guys olf their jobs from two weeks to a month and send them to major cities to assist in recniiting to maybe give the recruiters some reasons why theyre not being successful like maybe making the mistake of calling a negro prospect boy though trained as an engineer and a naval officer since commander taylor considers himself enough in tune with the negro community to help design an effective recruitment program the black man is not militarily oriented he says authoritatively as he slips gradually almost mechanically into a navy sales talk but he is still eligible for the draft when they came out and said no more deferments for graduate students in one day in new york city we had kids in that little recruiting station they were pushing out the walls and the poor chief in there was completely distraught you know something wasnt a black man in there okay maybe i dont like the military but i dont like digging foxholes either i like clean sheets i like an airconditioned room i like to eat on a table with a table cloth and i like a good five or sixcourse meal i like to watch a movie at night even if i have to run over to vietnam i can go out and get shot at hes a carrier fighter pilot and then come home and take a shower i dont have to sleep under a mosquito net i may even have to get up at three oclock in the morning now if i gotta do it sere in the military using my head how am i going to do it i mean you gotta be a little selfish where are those thinking black people in new york cit i wanna know when you put on that olive drab suit its just like everybody elscs oliv e drab suit and navy blue is better the same kind of gung ho talk comes of course from zealous recruiters for the u s marines like their navy counterparts they too are trying to overcome image problems arising largely out of the marines refusal until world war ii to accept negroes they would like somehow to double the negroes among the marines officers even though at least one of their headquarters generals loekstepped in the discredited tradition of gradual integration believes negroes ought to be more patient in their drive for equahty and justiee the marines have assigned lt col kenneth h berthoud to washington as advisor for the program he is the first of the corps two highest ranking negro officers it has no black senior officers six other negro officers are beating the bushes throughout the u s visiting colleges making public appearances and speaking to veteran civic and fraternal organizations about the marine corps and career opportunities for commissioned officers one of them capt solomon hill explains by virtue of the fact i am black i can identify and help make the program more credible but even though he is a brother by virtue of his skin color capt hill meets such obstacles in the negro community as fathers who remember their menial unglamorous duties in world war ii and tell their sons there are no opportunities in the military hills message is that opportunities now are unlimited the key is a college education he says but commissions are available under several programs and he has found groups where negro adult leaders even have tutored young negroes in advance to help them meet the qualifications one path is the platoon leaders course which has no oneampus military training but requires paid summer sessions at officers school another is the officers candidate school for present senior and college graduates the way hill himself got into the corps a third is under the nrotc program wherein qualifying high school seniors receive tuition books and a month throughout their college career similar programs have been set up by the u s air force to increase the negroes among its officers the negro cadets enrolled in the man wing at air force academy high up in the mountains at colorado springs are a far cry from the s when t he life of the black man in america has been a strange paradox since the very beginning a human being sold into slavery by fellow human beings in africa he was brought to american shores not as a human being but as a chattel slave with no more rights than his masters ox or horse or dog he walked like a man talked like a man was subject to all the human miseries that from time to time afflict a manbut he had no rights as a man the black family had no rights as a family and the black woman could be taken at her master s will to satisfy his lust children bom from the union of slaves and masters had no more rights than slaves even though they were the sons and daughters of free white men the only recognition the black slave received as a human being after the colonies became the united states was when slave holding states won the right to count each slave as threefifths a person for purposes of political representation although the slave was not given his threefifths of a right to vote consider the black soldier f the black man in america has found himself forever living a paradox first as a slave and later as a citizen without full rights as a citizen what can be said for the black soldier as soldiers and soldierservants to the british militia in the french and indian wars black men were in the predicament of battling against men who actually ofifered them better treatment than the forces with which they served with the british finally triumphant the black soldiers found themselves in the same position of involuntary servitude tliat they were in before the war was won when in the colonies revolted against british nile and thomas jefferson himself a slaveholder drafted the now immortal declaration of independence the members of the continental congress rejected his attempt to include an indictment of the british slave trade and slav ery although every member knew that one of the first men to die in the conflict against the british had been crispus attucks a black man and a former slave the ultimate paradox found black men fighting to help the united states win its independence from britainthe united states which declared that all men are created equal and that all men are endowed with certain unalienable rights including life liberty and the pursuit of happiness when the war was over many black soldiers had lost their lives few of them had their freedom and any thought of the pursuit of happiness was just an empty dream the war of found black soldiers again fighting for their country and its end found them again slaves or at best free men with no real rights as citizens the strangest paradox of all he civil war placed the black soldier in the strangest paradox of all in the early part of the war black men were not even allowed to fight in the union army although that war was supposedly designed to bring about a final end to cruel and inhuman slavery confederate gentlemen however took trusted black slaves with them to the battlegrounds and these black men assisted the very troops who were fighting to maintain slavery when the union army finally ojened its ranks to black troops black men not only volunteered by the thousands but were conscripted in large numbers by the northern states which were allowed to fill their troop quotas with either white or black soldiers and felt that black troops were more expendable when the civil war ended black soldiers found that they had mov ed up just one small notch now they were free men and tlie th and th amendments made them legally citizens but they had no jobs no money no training and no acres and a mule they had exchanged legal slavery for economic slavery i one war is like another o throughout history for the black soldier one war has been like another he fought valiantly in the spanishamerican war and came home to find that separate but equal was the law of the land he battled the hun in germany in world war i and came back to face a decade of brutal lynchings he went into world war h in december only to find that years after the declaration of independence black soldiers could serve only in segregated troops and that black troops got the menial jobs in service units while white men flew the planes drove the tanks and sailed the ships a u s armed forces completely segregated by race was fighting to destroy hitler the nazi leader who preached a doctrine of aryan supremacy but world war ii marked the beginning of the end for segregation in the armed forces the paradox was too great black men saw it first and fought against discrimination in the service of ones country black soldiers won the right to die in tanks and planes and on battleships instead of in bombed out trucks and laundry units they earned the right to die as marines instead of quartermaster soldiers and finally the enormity of the paradox reached the highest lev els and in president harry s tniman ordered the end of segregation in the armed forces but after the war hen the black gi returned to civilian life after again helping make the world safe for democracy he soon found that the black soldier still faced problems congress had enacted the famous gi bill designed to help the veteran regain his proper place in society the bill offered the famous clubfor weeks a veteran could collect a week while searching for a job the negro usually collected his full amountthere were just not enough jobs available for him the gi bill offered the veteran many other excellent opportunitiesbut the black v eteran usually could not take advantage of them there was a college education which the government would pay for but most black v eterans had not even finished high school there were small business loans but most black gis had no training to go into business there were gi mortgages guaranteed by the govemment and available at low interest rates but there was also housing segregation and inflated real estate prices that made homes in neighborhoods open to blacks too expensive to qualify for gi mortgages there were governmentbacked onthejob training programs but white firms refused the black vet and negro firms were few and far between so on to korea and vietnam t is little wonder that unrest began to grow in big city ghettos and that bitter black men began to preach against segregation and discrimination it is little wonder that black men are asking for a final showdown for an honest payment both within and without the armed forces for their centuries of unrewarded services to this country they have done their jobs from the revolution to vietnam see young gi on opposite page and they have been cheated of their just rewards make the promise of america available to all right now they say act now or face the consequences we ask no more or no less than has been given others could anything be more reasonable i t may be that the most seriously listened to black men in the united states today are the thousands of veterans returning from action in vietnam one of the reasons for this is their feeling readily evident in their conversation that they have paid their dues and are now ready to collect from the american society for which they have caught hell definitely stated is their feeling that in return for their fighting and their buddies dying in the vietnam jungles the united states owes black veterans something they express tliis attitude when they go job hunting and insist tliey be given meaningful work with a future it is shown in the attitude of the young vet who says some people discriminate against you whether you are a viet vet or not but you resent it more if you have given blood and sweat the national urban leagues executive director wliitney young who went to vietnam in articulates the same feeling when he warns that vietnam veterans are a force the nation can ill afford to have embittered the attitude the resentment youngs warningthese have made vetwatching serious business for politicians sociologists social scientists and revolutionaries who actually is this young man to whom so much attention is drawn the typical black veteran is years old single and a high school graduate or equivalent thereof who has had very limited work experience before going into the service according to frank steel national coordinator of the urban leagues veterans affairs department officials at the new york city division of veteran affairs draw a similar picture adding that the young man has generally seen to months of combat in vietnam the typical black veteran is also as yet rather apolitical he is not involved in any civil_rights or political organizationsa trait he shares with most of black america this does not mean that he is unaware of events around him quite the contrary most vets express definite views on current national and international issues its just that as one young veteran explains i am still getting adjusted back to civilian life i cant tell other people what to do until i get myself together black vets are aware that many groups are interested in gaining their allegiance some in fact seem to enjoy being pursued but their attitude can best be described as one of waitandsee upon their release from serv ice having experienced the widely publicized and unreal integration of fox holes some black vets begin to feel that maybe things have changed and integration is the norm of life but the reality of racism in america soon shatters their illusions robert jenkins a yearold veteran of five months in vietnam combat in a reconnaisance platoon put it bluntly theyll polish your shoes while you are there but then they start their crap the minute they get back over here conrad ltm a yearold lavycr who handles many black antidraft cases and who has the reputation of being radical usually sees the more militant vietnam veterans in his office describing the more than clients he has seen since lvnn savs most of them have been oversold by armed forces propaganda on the opportunities for training in occupations which will be valuable for them in civilian life tliis has in fact not been the case as a result of their experiences in vietnam they return with a great respect for the physical power of the u s government but are unreconciled to the conditions of life for the majority of black people lynn adds some of them tell me that they are prepared for the eventuality of urban guerrilla warfare the plight of the black veteran has attracted federal private and municipal institutions the american establishment is well aware that retuniing black veterans will have a direct influence on their communities in the cnicial period ahead one instrument which the federal government uses to help returning vets is project transition the armed servaces fourpronged program of counseling education job training and placement for veterans nearing rr discharge participation is voluntary and all veterans with less than six months service left are eligible the men are questioned on their job training and educational aims and then counseled on what will best benefit their civ ilian needs then through project transition they can attend armed forces schools that teach civilian skills or take classes developed and financed by local state and fcderal agencies for their own recruiting needs or enroll in courses set up for them in educational institutions although no one says directly that this program is aimed towards black veterans it is a well known secret that officials are eager for them to benefit from it up to this point however few of them have been attracted to the program on a priate level the veteran affairs program of the national urban league is designed specifically for minority group vietnam veterans operating since september the program has received from the rockefeller fund from the ppg industries foundation and approximately from large bluechip companies with fulltime coordinators themselves veterans working in nine urban league cities new york atlanta new orleans los angeles san francisco detroit pittsburgh and chicago the program helps veterans find jobs and housing and advises them on their rights and benefits from federal and local agencies commanding officers in vietnam arc directed to see that all black soldiers with days or less to go get a copy of the official form urban league minority group separation information the form is filled out by the vet and returned to the leagues offices he is then sent a more detailed questionnaire which will enable the league to help him upon discharge on a local level new york city has as do other large cities a division of veterans affairs to service returning vets the division receives from local draft boards names of all men from the new york area who have been released from duty letters are then sent to these men notifying them of the services available to them vincent malveaux a senior veteran counselor with the nyc division of veteran affairs and otilio mighty of the urban leagues veterans di ision agree that to most vets jobs are the most immediate concern not just any job but jobs that pay well and offer a future mighty found that most of them want a job thats going someplace that has promotional mobilityno snow jobs but meaningful jobs when they retiini home notes malveaux if the armed forces can take disadvantaged unskilled young men and train them to do vital and skilled jobs in the serv ice then private industry can and must take these same young men in civilian life and train them for meaningful jobs malveaux himself an army veteran adds that the urgency most vets have about employment is due to their disadvantaged backgrounds in many instances they are heads of families including not just wives and children but younger brothers and sisters furthermore theres no chance of their taking advantage of existing educational and housing benefits until they are securely employed a man must have a steady job before he can get a loan to buy a home or pay for higher education both malveaux and mighty feel that the job market for returning vets is generally good most employers being pragmatic are aware of the need to provide employment for the thousands of young black vets returning home and the dangers to their own selfinterest of having them idly uncmployed and underemployed mighty who has counseled more than vets on housing education and jobs says that he has found jobs available except in the construc tion field where union discrimination is rampant he claims that out of an average of vets who come in monthly seeking employment over per cent have been placed in jobs with an average pay of to x weekly for unskilled workers which is equivalent to the income of white americans who have never gone to high school a veteran of years in the air force mighty believes strongly that two years of work experience in the military should count for something we cannot see starting a vet at the same rate as a high school kid despite the cautious optimism expressed by officials regarding the job situation some vets appear more skeptical one veteran says he hasnt evperienced outright discrimination they are more subtle than that and you get the classic run around like we have a number of applicants for the job or well get in touch with you or well keep you on file so were just kidding ourselves when we say the doors are wide open they may be cracked a little more but tliere are still the double standards one black vet who landed a good job with the help of the urban league is yearold raul ferran a survivor of months infantry duty in vietnam raul released from the service in april works as an apprentice mechanic for clarke equipment company in queens new york his apprenticeship will last four years and raul describing himself very satisfied with his new job feels he has found a career the unmarried exsoldier who has been at clarke for three months makes a week like many of his vietnam peers raul is iminvolved politically though he hastily adds i dont like whats going on in regards to our people a second trouble area for returning black vets is education in congress passed what is now called the cold war gi bill it is purportedly designed to assist vxts in completing their education both mighty and malveaux along with other veterans counselors denounce the gross inadequacies of the bill in meeting the educational needs of the vietnam v ets in general and black vets in particular mighty calls the financial assistance allowed for in the current bill a month for a single vet and if he is married something vvhich in reality docs more to provide pocket money for the middleclass vet who has substantial support from home or other sources than it does for the average black veteran who comes from a disadvantaged background in malveauxs opinions most of the vets cannot afford to go to school full time as is required to get the entire and if they go part time they get only a month despite americas economic advancements this is below ww ii rates when returning vets received full tuition fees and book costs plus a month living allowances the which the vietnam veterans receive has to cover everytliing malveaux who sees an average of to vets a day seeking educational assistance finds that most of them are interested in completing their high school requirements or in going to a trade school coming from a disadvantaged background he explains they dont have visions of going to college they want to go to trade schools where they can develop skills for immediate jobs both men stress that tlie gi bill benefits must be greatly improved if they are going to have any significant meaning for the black veteran one vietnam veteran now using the new gi bill is yearold luis callendar who saw months of combat with the st airborne div recently married he attends school fulltime thereby geting the per month allotted to married students he can do this because his wife works and he holds a parttime job during the school year a journalism major callendar is working this summer as a writer on a company house organ he considers himself a part of the new breed of black men and says what impressed him most upon his return from vietnam was the new attitude of positive blackness he saw in many people he also recalls an incident which occurred shortly after his return from vietnam immediately after coming home i decided to go down to fort bragg n c to visit a buddy vvho had saved my life in vietnam and lost two legs in the process on the vvay down i stopped at a roadside cafe to get a sandwich tlie man inside told me tliis is a private club i said why dont you say you dont serve black people he said ok we dont serve niggers remember now i vvas wearing my uniform decorated with combat medals all during this time tliat incident really shook me and also woke me up the third pressing concern of black vietnam v ets is housing and it is here where bias is most prevalent and entrenched and also where the similarity between ww ii and vietnam vets is probably most striking mighty and malveaux both vets of ww ii remember how housing developments then were built all over the country for returning vets and how difficult if not totally impossible it was for black vets to get into these developments malveatix recalls that black vets always had to buy older houses with shorter mortgages as a result we didnt get all the benefits of the housing loans today black vets returning from vietnam run into similar roadblocks in trying to purchase homes in burgeoning suburbs mighty calls the housing loans unrealistic and deceptive upon close checking the only thing the government does is to guarantee a certain interest say four per cent on a loan the banks dont have to recognize this guarantee and most nyc banks tend to ignore it after all why should they give a loan at per cent even with a government guarantee when they can get higher rates the government has used no power to make them give vets lower rates yearold douglas gaines of harlem is in dire need of good housing a veteran of months of vietnam combat he is one of children eight of whom are still living at home in a three and a half room apartment the gainess apartment is neat and welltaken care of but the building itself is among the most rundown in all of harlem with years of school behind him douglas the oldest child still living at home now heads the household he hopes his family can get public housing he doesnt even dream of buying a home because this would require a wellpaying steady job something hard to come by for a young black unskilled vet douglas also wants to continue his education but with all his obligations the new g bill does not offer enough to really help him the black veteran coming back from vietnam can expect difficulty in finding adequate housing in getting a decent job or in continuing his education yet if he is healthy he can still fry to make iton the streets if necessary but to the veteran who comes back on a stretcher wounded and wretching with pain even militant protest is impossible since january some men have been wounded in vieti nam their injuries often result in loss of limbs body burus broken backs brain damage paralysis most of these are injuries which bar total recovery wounded vets are sent to hospitals near their homes i in the new york metropolitan area they go to st albans naval hospital in queens last year wounded men were cared for at the hospital from january to pril of this year there arc beds at the hospital and approximately half are occupied by men from vietnam af least one third of them are black many of the more severely injured men are from disadvantaged backgrounds they went into the service particularly those in the marines with little education and chance for rear line jobs this is one of the reasons they were mox ed up front and directly into combat most of the wounded require orthopedic care some need surgery and others undergo plastic and neurosurgery some can move about and require minimum care others linger near death in the intensive care unit far too many endure day to day immobilized with pain and suffering twentyyearold anthony preston was in vietnam two months when he was wounded he and a buddy were driving to get water when they met sniper fire he pushed on the gas hit a pot hole and the jeep overturned leaving him with a broken back and leg hell have to stay in the hospital for a year and on his back for at least six months its rough he says smiling despite the pain if i hadnt gone over i wouldnt be here but i suppose the same could have happened in civilian life mv friends come and visit me but when they leave they run around party have a good time and here i am man its really a let down he gets good treatment at the hospital but it doesnt lessen the disillusionment people ask me why i volunteered to go over in the first place he says but at the time it seemed the only thing to do like many other young black men right out of high school preston was la he wanted to get a job but no one would take him and train him for something he considered worthwhile they knew would be drafted soon and they didnt want to take the risk he didnt have enough money for school so he started out making hamburgers a job which was too hard had no personal gain and offered little pride he began roaming the streets getting into trouble and soon figured the best thing to do was to join the army he has a brother stationed in iran who does topographical surveys and thats what he had in mind instead he was given artillery training and shipped over to vietnam his chances of recovery are good when he gets out he wants to go into data processing or study sociology but thats for the future now he doesnt have too many thoughts about anything except how different things should have been the hospital does not keep records on how many veterans leave there disabled but william moses their veteran affairs contact says he sees around disabled patients a month over a third of them black wbo come to him seeking benefits and training programs to overcome their handicaps they may go to trade and technical schools or college have onthejob training or institutional ontbefarm training or cboose a combined program of school and job training frequently veterans leave st albans hospital mentally crippled as well as physically disabled explains urologist dr ernest simms so many of the guys who come in here wounded particularly the serious ones are from disadvantaged backgrounds and the only thing they have going for them is their health when they start losing a leg or an eye or have their body burned all over they feel worthless some of them have real trouble even sleeping they feel like they want to die they sort of lose their spark they might come back but itll take a long time for many of them doctors who treat the wounded vets have also found out that often their families are reluctant to take care of them because of this one doctor observes theyre not anxious to go home theyre actually sort of in liinho the hospital staff is aware of the psychological rehabilitation many of the dischargees need hut their first concern is that the veterans wounded in vietnam stay alive its kind of tragic says dr simms but our main purpose is to get them well enough to send them to a veterans hospital for continuing care or separate them from the service with a disability upon being separated from the service with a disability the veteran is eligible for pension ranging from a month plus a small allowance per dependent for a per cent or total disability to a minimum disability pension of a month the average age of those at the hospital wounded in vietnam is twenty and a half years when they leave the hospital they want to start living again but many particularly black vets face the world again with mixed emotions it doesnt matter whether you are a veteran or not or have been wounded says yearold marine charles miles who has been in the hospital months recovering from wounds in his arm stomach and chest if youre black you still have a problem getting a job and housing many vets who have not graduated from high school and find themselves physically handicapped by war wounds dont know what to do they know prejudice and custom will conspire against their color and disability and they feel little has changed for them despite all theyve gone through for their country this year there will be an estimated black vets returning to civilian life with more than of them from vietnam guardedly optimistic statistics thrown about by organizations attempting to help black vets are less comforting when checked closely how many of them really get the urban leagues form how many receive the letter from the new york city division of veterans affairs do these programs do much good does the governments project transition really help most black vets interviewed by ebony hadnt even heard of this much ballyhooed program how many vets are really aware of the limited benefits available to them commissioner robert j desanctis head of the nyc division of veterans affairs believes that less than per cent of vets know their benefits because of the changes made in the law since when they return from the war black vets have been disciplined to keep their mouths shut most of them however are aware of whats going on and have probably made their decision on what course they will take when necessary they know better than anyone else the high cost black people are paying in the vietnam war one young vet remembers that in his squad of men one was white three were puertorican three were mexicanamericans and nine were soul brothers yet he sarcastically remarks now that im home watching television it seems that per cent of the men fighting over there are white you practically never see a brother being interv iewed will the bitterness sometimes felt by returning black vets be overcome will the hopes and dreams many of them bring back to america really be fulfilled or will the black veterans service in vietnam continue to be forgotten as soon as he returns home because of his color these are the questions black veterans are asking and the answers hav e not yet been reassuring to them considering the special skills uncle sam has taught themdemolitions disciplined fighting psychological warfare sabotage and countless other skillsit is to societys adantage to give them an honorable and productive civilian life tliese menofaction will play an important role in the future of black americawhat that role will be will depend on how and what they collect on the dues they have paid in bloody vietnam l ee bradley a career seaman who joined the navy by coincidence and found a home plays a vital role in the undersea defense of the east coast as chief machinists mate aboard the nuclear submarine vss rciij lead ship of the atlantic fleet undersea patrol he oversees the maintenance and operation of the topsecret atomic power plant and the atmospheric control system he is guardian of the vessels radiation level the yearold squarejawed sailor is part of a corps that proudly calls its field a special corner of the navy when the ray was recently recognized as one of the atlantic fleets most efficiently run underwater vessels bradley was singled out by his super ising officer lt john spoko as one of the best of an elite group twelve years ago when bradley enlisted he had no idea he would someday play a vital part in the nations defense in as an ycarold fresh out of high school he went to the army recruiting station in his native jonesboro la with one aim to complete a fouryear hitch and go on to college and a career the army office was closed when i got there he recalls so i went next door to the navy recruiting station and found a home for his first six years in uniform bradley worked in engine rooms of steamdriven freighters and repair ships in an executive officer noticing the young seamans interest in the submarine adventures of world war ii casually advised why dont you switch to submarine duty where the future is bradley who by this time had developed a burning desire to go underwater did not need a shove by early he was ready for onthejob training aboard the uss sam rayburn he left the rayburn in for the ray which was then still under construction at the norfolk va naval base there he helped supervise installation of the nuclear power plant now one of more than seamen cramped in a by foot steel cigar chief bradley leads an almost monastic life often cniising for months without seeing daylight or establishing contact with the outside world though the atomic submarine is a relatively troublefree ship compared to steam powered vessels whose moving parts require constant attention bradley has had to dismount several pieces of delicate equipment just to change a tiny valve he and his capable subordinates perform with cool precision where ordinary men would quake with nervousness in their line of work the slightest error could cause major disaster there are much simpler ways to serve uncle sam the chief admits but once you get your dolphins you dont want to know about any of them after a while you become convinced that the nuclear sub is the only way to go to sea bradley liked the sea so well he rarely again gave the landlubbering life a serious thought today he shrugs i couldnt go back to jonesboro and look for a job because thats strictly a paper mill town they dont offer anything in my line of work comparing the stocky seamans enthusiastic description of his naval career to his somber discussion of what he might do when he is discharged no time soon he vows one has no trouble believing his claim that theres no life like life on an atomic submarine i n vietnam as long as there are jungles to march through snipers to be caught and mines hidden in rice paddies gis havent got time to wonder whats for dinner however mothers and wives who worry daily for their mens welfare can take heart about their eating habits at any rate although the military cannot promise a life of ease on the vietnam front it can jrovide at least one hot nutritious meal ier day to weary soldiers on the line of battle although traditionally the soldiers favorite gripe has been the chow is lousy the military spends much time and money preparing wellbalanced dinners for men in combat by the end of his tour each soldier will be more than familiar with the armys a b and crations ranging from the full hot meals with fresh fruit and vegetables a to dry packaged foods c called meal combat individual no matter how heavy the fighting military helicopters try to fly in a hot a meal daily for the men to supplement their crations and todays gi is afforded the comparative luxury of not having to carry metal mess kits he now eats off disposable paper plates that doesnt mean that army kitchens are now concocting gourmet delights for soldiers in battle as shown on the following pages menus center around the simple allamerican dishes such as meat loaf roast pork and ham but many civilians will be surprised at the variety of items contained in hot meals at the front not only do they look appetizing but they are to some cis out in the field almost as good as dinner at home a hostage of fate and a warrior against fate the black soldier has fought for some years on the front lines of ambiguity never sure of the real identity of his enemy or the precise location of his battlefield never completely accepted by his comrades in arms or his white neighbors at home the black soldier has willingly and repeatedly offered himself as a witness in war to the truths america refuses to recognize in war or peace always from the first days of the republic the black soldier has fought away from home for the freedoms denied him at home at the back of his mind always has been the vain hope that america woidd recognize his bravery away from home by recognizing him as a man at home and in pursuing that hope the black soldier has written in blood a testament of generosity and gallantry which is a standing reproach and invitation to the republic in every american war on almost every american battlefield black men of war have paid in the flesh for the dream denied and the history of black soldiers and sailors is indelibly etched in the history of the american republic which lives today because many men including a long black line of brave black men marched off to ambiguous graves it was clear from the very beginning that black soldiers would occupy a special and controversial slot in the american mind out of fear and a sense of guilt the first american colonists made repeated and somewhat hysterical attempts to keep guns out of the hands of black sla es and black free men in for example in perhaps the first discriminatory provision in american history all colonists except blacks were required to arm themselves subsequently black men and indians were barred from the colonial militia but these provisions which were designed apparently to thwart slave insurrections were ignored when the white man needed help as a result black men fought side by side with white colonists in americas first military adventures in the french and indian war for instance northeni and southern colonists appealed to the patriotism of slaves and free men black soldiers were especially prominent in the militia companies of new ibrk and connecticut they also fought in integrated companies in the militia of southern states in gen edward braddock wrote from virginia there are here numbers of mulattoes and free negroes of whom i shall make bat men whom the province are to furnish with jay and frocks whcn some years later the shot was fired that was heard around the world black minutemen were on the scene and shooting at the bridge in concord and on the greensward at lexington black and white men stood shoulder to shoulder and shot america into history among the black minutemen who participated in the famous skirmishes on the night of april were peter salem cato stedman cuff whittemore cato wood prince estabrook caesar ferritt samuel craft lemuel haynes and pomp blackman although great care has been taken to hide the fact the second great battle in the birth of america was also an integrated affair vlien the kedcoats charged up breeds hill in the battle mistakenly identified as the battle of bunker hill a number of black soldiers helped to repel the charge peter salem a former slave who also won battle stars at valley forge and white plains killed maj john pitcairn who was the first englishman to mount the breastworks another black soldier salem poor matched peter salems valor poor was later commended by officers who said he behav ed like an experienced officer as well as an excellent soldier to set forth the particulars of his conduct would be tedious in the person of this said negro centres a brave and gallant soldier equally gallant in this seminal american battle were several other black men including pomp fisk grant cooper charleston eads seymour burr titus cobuni cuff hayes and caesar dickerson at least one black soldier caesar brown of westford connecticut was killed in action on bunker hill the bravery of the black defenders of bunker hill was not applauded by all men the deepseated fear of black men with guns persisted and when george washington assumed command he promptly issued an order barring black men from the ranks of the continental army the order dated november said neither negroes sic boys unable to bear arms nor old men unfit to endure the fatigue of the campaign are to be enlisted washingtons order did not go unchallenged there were protests from free black men and an enormously effective direct action campaign by the slaves thousands of slaves including some belonging to george washington and thomas jefferson deserted the plantations in order to fight for their freedom lord dunmore the british general fished in the troubled waters of the colonies by forming an ethiopian legion and inviting black men to join his forces it has been estimated that some slaves escaped during the revolutionary war in this volatile situation which was complicated by the reluctance of white men to fight for americas freedom general washington reversed himself and sanctioned the enlistment of black men it has been presented to me washington said that the free negroes who have serv ed in this army are very much dissatisfied at being discarded as it is to be apprehended that they may seek employ in the ministerial british army i have presumed to depart from the resolution respecting them and have given license for their being enlisted after the disastrous winter of vdley forge washington scrapped all resolutions and accepted slaves and free blacks since it was possible for whites to evade war serv ices by sending substitutes many black men fought in place of their masters the grand outcome was that some five thousand black men fought for american freedom in the continental army there were several allblack companies and an allblack rhode island regiment but most black men fought in integrated units a hessian officer in the british army remarked on this fact in a letter of october the negro can take the field instead of his master and therefore no regiment is to be seen in which there arc not negroes in abundance black soldiers participated in most of the major battles and campaigns they crossed the delaware with washington fought with the green mountain boys at ticonderoga and helped repulse the hessians at the battle of rhode island they also fought at long island brandywine yorktown white plains red bank saratoga savannah trenton long island stillwater bennington beinis heights stony point princeton and valley forge america also received help from the black men of haiti some haitians including henri christophe participated in the siege of savannah there were also black pilots and seamen in americas infant navy black men were members of the crews of the alliance roebuck adventure trumbull aurora hazard and prospect no less important was the help of black laborers messengers and spies anthony waynes success at stony point was due largely to the brilliance of pompey a slave spy who obtained the british password for the americans another spy james armistead of virginia was an important factor in the military campaigns of gen lafay ette in the popular imagination the dominant image of the revolutionary war is the picture of the drummers and fifers of the spirit of the drummers and fifers are usually pictured as white men although some were black barzillai lew a sixfoot giant was a drummer and fifer for capt john fords company of the th massachusetts regiment another drummer was jabez jolly of capt rufus lincolns company of the tli massachusetts regiment once the iclory w as secured america speedily rejected tlie war rhetoric of the dcclaratioii of independence but a considerable number of black men many of them re oluliouary war veterans made token gains as a direct result of the wir in the first flush of idealism following

services of the be ohitionarv war vett rans had been forgotten and the sons and daughters of the black veterans of had been excluded from tlic prizes their fathers had helped to win bichard allen the churchman and pioneer black leader cried out against the betrayal of the dream citing an old potan god and a soldier all men do adore in time of war and not before when the war is over and all things

lakes commodore oliver hazard perry commendeil tlic bravery of the seamen w ho fought under his command on lake erie saying that they seemed to bo absolutely insensible of danger during this conflict the legislature of new york authorized the raising of two regiments of black soldiers and two battalions of black men were mobilized in the new orleans area tlirce months before the battle of new orleans gen andrew jackson issued a ringing proclamation to the free colored inhabitants of louisiana as sons of freedom you are now called upon to defend our most inestimable blessing as americans your country looks w ith confidence to her adopted children for a valorous support as a faithful return for the advantages enjoyed under her mild and equitable government as fathers husbands and brothers you are summoned to rally around the standard of the eagle to defend all which is dear in existence to every noblehearted generous freeman of color volunteering to serve during the present contest with great britain and no longer there will be paid the same bounty in money and lands now received by the white soldiers of the united states viz one hundred and twentyfour dollars in money and one hundred and sixty acres of land the noncommissioned officers and privates will also be entitled to the same monthly pay and daily rations and clothes furnished to any american soldier on the eve of the battle jackson again addressed the black troops saying to the men of colorsoldiers from the shores of mobile i collected you to armsi invited you to share in the perils and to divide the glory of your white countrymen i expected much from you for i was not uninformed of tiiose qualities which must render you so lormidable to an invading foe i knew tliat you could endure hunger and thirst and all the hardships of war i knew that you lo ed the land of your nativity and that like ourselves you had to defend all that is most dear to man but you surpassed my hopes have found in you united to these qualities that noble enthusiasm which impels to great deeds in the battle tliat followed the black iikh from the shores of mobile and new orleans fought with distinction hut they were not invited to diide the glory and when as a result of this default it became necssary to fight a ci il war to insure the survi al of the union black civilians and soldiers entered a new phase of struggle since this war struck at the roots of slav eholder power black americans were among its most fervent supporters but in this war as in almost every other american war they had to fight for the right to die for almost two years the lincoln administration refused to accept black soldiers contending that the war was a gentlemanly misunderstanding between white men but war has a logic of its own and in response to that logic vvliich was expressed in dwindling white enlistments and the murderouslv effective resistance of the rebels lincoln overruled himself and stretched forth his hands to ethiopia the first black soldiers were accepted officially in late and early before the rebellion was quelled some black soldiers answered the call to arms more than of these soldiers gave their lives for the american union in fact the mortality rate of black soldiers was almost per cent higher than the mortality rate of white troops almost all black soldiers fought in the allblack units regiments of infantry seven regiments of cavalry twelve regiments of heavy artillery one regiment of light artillery and one regiment of engineers these units were organized into a separate service the bureau of colored troops and were identified as united states colored troops usct in the height of bureaucratic assininity the u s even issued a separate training manual for black troopsu s infantry tactics for use of colored troops during the war the army organized the largest allblack unit in its history the xxv corps which consisted of three black divisions another large unit the corps dafrique was organized in louisiana by and large black soldiers fought under white officers of the officers assigned to the usct only or including eight surgeons were black the highest ranking officers were lt col reed of the st north carolina regiment lt col a t augustana a surgeon and maj martin delany an unusually high proportion of black men served in the union navy about one out of every four union sailors out of was black black men held all ranks below petty officer and one black man robert smalls of south carolina held the unofficial rank of captain by all accounts the black union sailors gave a good account of themselves they served on the kearsage the hartfordy the monitor and other famous union vessels black seamen won four congressional medals of honor no less heroic were black soldiers who won medals of honor and participated in engagements and battles including the petersburg assault and the battles of the crater olustee honey springs darbytown fair oaks hatchers run and deep bottom black soldiers were also in the front ranks in the battle of nashville where some ten thousand of them helped to rout john bell hoods army the battle of millikens bend where fonner slaves from louisiana and mississippi repulsed a division of texans and the battles of port hudson and fort wagner where the louisiana native guards port hudson and the th massachusetts volunteers wagner made splendid charges in the face of withering enemy fire one of the witnesses of the fort wagner charge was harriet tubman a black union army spy who left a memorable and oftquoted description of war and then we saw the lightning and that was the guns and then we heard the thunder and that was the big guns and then we heard the rain falling and that was the drops of blood falling and when we came to get the crops it was dead men we reaped there have been repeated attempts to picture black men as beneficiaries of a freedom they neither sought nor fought for but the record indicates that black men were at center stage in the big battles that led to black emancipation the black regiments of the xxv corps provided some of the heft that broke the back of lees defense at the siege of petersburg and the winter campaign in virginia black soldiers were among the first union troops to enter charleston the st usct and the th massachusetts and richmond elements of the xxv corps and when the end came two black brigades of the xxv corps were hot on the heels of robert e lees disorganized rebels perhaps the outstanding sally of black troops in the civil war was the charge of the third brigade of the th division on the confederate fortifieations on new market heights near richmond for their gallantry in this action black soldiers received congressional medals of honor in one day black men provided the vital difference in the civil war but they were discriminated against in equipment assignments and promotions until the last year of the war all black soldiers received a month as compared with a month for the lowestranking white soldier some soldiers mutinied over the discriminatory pay scale others refused to accept money from the government until the wage differential was corrected another point of controversy was the refusal of the confederacy to extend the courtesies of war to black combatants some captured soldiers were murdered and some were sold into slavery the thrust of the confederate war policy was dramatized by the fort pillow massacre on april after capturing the fort gen nathan of operations members of the ncl division received decorations incliidinr two distinguished service crosses legion of merit awards silver stars bedford forrest a former slave dealer and a future leader of the ku klux klan coldbloodedly slew the survivors a congressional committee said later that forrest and his men committed many atrocities and buried some soldiers alive although black men in blue fought with ropes around their necks although they were shamefully treated by their comrades in arms and patronized by the government for whom they fought they played an indispensable role in saving the american union lincoln who initially opposed the use of black troops said later that the north couldnt have whipped the south without the help of the black soldiers and the more than black laborers at the end of the civil war black soldiers became regular members of the u s military establishment by an act of congress passed in four regimentsthe th and th infantry and the th and th cavalrywere organized as permanent army units most officers of the regular army regiments were white the bestknown graduate of these regiments was john pershing who earned the nickname black jack because of his service with black soldiers b o davis sr who became the first black general in the us army during world war h also served with the famous buffalo soldiers although tv and other media conveniently forget the th and th cavalry professional soldiers from these units were centrally and ambiguously involved in the winning of the west between and black frontier fighters won congressional medals of honor for making the west safe for white settlers the four regular army units were among the first u s troops ordered to the front in the spanish american war at the first battle las guasimas the th cavalry distinguished itself by coming to the lescue of the rough riders black jack pershing who was then a lieutenant in the th said the black troops charged up the hill and opened a disastrous enfilading fire upon the spanish right thus relieving the pinneddown rough riders also active in the battle of san juan hill were the th cavalry and the th infantry the th infantry was in the thick of the fighting at the battle of el caney members of the regular army regiments won five congressional medals of honor for gallantry in this pioneer police action in addition to the regular army soldiers volunteer regiments were raised by several states but none of these regiments reached cuba in time to lake part in the battle it has been estimated that approximately black officers were commissioned during the war despite the gallantry of black soldiers at san juan hill and the shortlived police action in mexico the status of black americans plummeted to a new low in the first and second decades of the th century and by the opening of world war i black soldiers and civ ilians were considered beyond the pale the tightening of racial lines had a deleterious effect on black doughboys who had to fight once again for the right to die on an equal basis after a long and bitter struggle some black men were mobilized and perhaps including combat troops were sent to france the black combat units were assigned to a french command and fought in sev eral important battles including argonne forest chateauthierry st mihiel vosges and metz four of the leading regiments of the war were composed of black soldiersthe th the th the st and the nd for gallantry in action these regiments were awarded the croix de guerre the th which was under fire for days longer than any other american unit was the first allied unit to reach the rhine in the cxiirse of the war many individuals distinguished themselves by acts of valor in fact the first american soldiers to receive the croix de guerre in this war were two black men henry johnson and needham roberts reports in hand gen pershing said in a contemporary communique show a notable instance of bravery and devotion shown by two soldiers of an american colored regiment operating in a french sector before daylight on may private henry johnson and private roberts while on sentry duty at some distance from one another were attacked by a german raiding party estimated at twenty men who advanced in two groups attacking at once from flank and rear both men fought bravely in handtohand encounters one resorting to the use of a bolo knife after his rifle jammed and further fighting with bayonet and butt became impossible attention is drawn to the fact that the colored sentries were first attacked and continued fighting after receiving wounds and despite the use of grenades by a superior force they should be given credit for preventing by their bravery a capture of any of our men as in other american wars black soldiers fought generally under white commanders the highestranking of the x black officers were gol franklin a denison th infantry lt gol ollie b davis th gavalry and lt col otis b duncan th infantry at the beginning of the war col charles young the highestranking black officer was forced into retirement because of alleged high blood pressure col young protested this decision and rode a horse from ohio to washington d c to prove his physical fitness but he was not returned to active duty until the end of the war for black officers and for black enlisted men world war i was a deeply disturbing experience discrimination at home and abroad reached staggering heights and the government went out of its way to emphasize the subordinate status of black soldiers most of whom were confined to labor and ser ice brigades an official order issued by pershings headquarters on august dramatized the official hostility the order was captioned to the french military mission stationed with the american armysecret infonnation conceniing the black american troops conclusion wc must prevent the rise of any pronounced degree of intimacy between french officers and black officers we may be courteous and amiable with the last but we cannot deal with them on the same plane as with the white american officer without deeply wounding the latter we must not eat with them must not shake hands or seek to talk or meet with them outside of the requirements of military service we must not commend too highly the american troops particularly in the presence of white americans make a point of keeping the native cantonment population from spoiling the negroes white americans become greatly incensed at any public exjression of intimacy between white women and black men black soldiers reacted to official humiliation with rage and sullenness in members of the th infantry regiment shot up houston texas killing some whites in france the reaction was less violent but no less significant william l dawson a young lieutenant who is today a u s congressman was so embittered that he vowed never to fight again for america charles houston a lieutenant who later engineered the naacp legal campaign expressed a similar disillusionment german prisoners he wrote later were kinder than our white american comrades back in the united states whites scorned us despite the fact that we were u s army officers wearing obvious overseas chevrons on our sleeves there was one consolation i said it and meant it i am damn glad i didnt lose my life in france fighting for this country by world war ii both dawson and houston had moderated their original opinions but the black community was clearly in a conditional mood at the very beginning of the war black men told america that they were tired of making the world safe for others and unsafe for themselves a new mood a product of disillusionment and broken promises welled up from the depths of the community and found expressions in demonstrations petitions and angry words some men notably bayard rustin and elijah muhammad went to jail others filed lawsuits challenging segregation and discrimination in the armed forces and in american life in response to this mood america moved a little faced by a lawsuit from yancy williams a howard university student the war department dropped its forwhitesonly policy and opened a jim crow flying school at ticskegee other segments of the armed servicesthe navy the u s marinesfollowed suit and by the end of the war black men occupied new but still subordinate ground a total of black men were inducted or drafted into the armed services during the war and more than half of them saw service in the european and pacific theaters of operation black men constituted about per cent of the armed forces per cent of the army per cent of the navy per cent of the marines and per cent of the coast guard there were additionally some black wacs and waves soldiers and sailors fought nazi racism in segregated units the largest allnegro units were the nd division which fought in the mediterranean theater and the rd division which was assigned to the pacific theater after the battle of the bulge beleaguered american commanders ordered integration at the platoon level in limited sections of the european theater tliere were approximately commissioned officers including one general and ten colonels in the army less than per cent of the total number of officers the navy reported officers including one lieutenant commander the highest ranking black officer was gen b o davis sr who was promoted in general davis son col b o davis jr the commander of the nd fighter group was the highestranking air force officer despite official hostility and indifference americas black guardians made an admirable record they fought on the beaches of sicily and normandy and helped roll back the nazi and japanese offensive in europe and asia twentytwo black combat units were in the forefront of the allied war effort in europe several of these units including the st and th tank destroyer battalions and the rd and th field artillerv battalions had outstanding combat records so did the nd fighter group which received a presidential unit citation for brilliance in the air war in the pacific theater black combat units fought in the philippines and on the solomon islands and in the coral sea they were also present and aceounted for at guadalcanal okinawa bougainville and treasury island black men were again denied the congressional medal of honor but there was no dearth of individual braverv private robert h brooks was the first member of the u s armored forces and probably of tbe u s army to give his life in the war against japan and dorie miller a navy mess attendant vvas the first hero of the war in an extraordinary act of heroism during the pearl harbor attack miller manned a machine gun and bagged six zeros he was later awarded the navy cross three other black men vvon the navy cross and five soldiers received the distinguished service cross members of the nd fighter group won distinguished flying crosses as in other american wars black men fought on a rev olving battlefield throughout this war there were repeated protests mutinies and riots against racism in america this struggle reached new heights in the postwar climate and forced new departures on the homefront and in the armed services when president truman called for a peacetime draft asa philip randolph the veteran leader announced plans for a nationwide civil disobedience movement negroes randolph said are sick and tired of being asked to shoulder guns in defense of democracy abroad until they get some at home they are prepared to resort to civil disobedience and refusal to register for the draft if it means serving time in a jim crow army faced by a determined randolph and a black community teetering on the edge of open revolt president truman adopted a new tack establishing in the presidents committee on equal treatment and opportunity in the armed services this tentative step supplemented by the reports of numerous committees and task forces led to a policy of integration in the armetl forces and by the end of the korean war the army reported that only of its xx black soldiers were serving in segregated units unfortunately integration did not extend into the precincts of power in the army reported black officers including five colonels out of a total of officers the korean war was a training ground and a transition point for the new policy in the midst of the war and with cnymplete secrecy the army quietly deactivated black units and assigned black soldiers to white units the th and th cavalry vvere transformed into the th and th tank battalions and the th and th infantry regiments were officiallv deactivated before its deactivation the famous th gave an ironic last hurrah capturing yechon in the first u s victory of tlie korean war a member of the th pvt william h thompson added another postscript to history by bectming the first black man to win a congressional medal of honor since the spanishamerican war thompsons feat was duplicated by another member of the th sgt cornelius h charlton who was honored in because of their marginal position on the homefront and americas extended position in world affairs black soldiers became increasingly important in the u s military posture in the late fifties at the same time they came under increasing pressure from black civilians who were assuming new roles and making new demands on the homefront the vietnam war a highly controversial military adventure intensified this pressure raising nevv questions about the meaning and the mission of the black guardians of americas ramparts these questions have raised in turn new questions about the meaning of america and america having proved finally that all men are equal in her military graves is faced with the necessity of matching the generosity of black soldiers by prov ing that all men are equal on her ambiguous streets
i am wliitc and years of age the world that we live in is important to me and unless we can look at both sides of the way life is tliere is no sense in trying to think you can make it better the article an awakening of black xim power oct was excellent the commiinities of nuns where the majority is white can learn much from the negro nun my praise goes all out to sister martin de forres for her great undertaking in bringing her conference into reality i hoxe unit many communities of white sisters will havc the chance to read tliis article for it has left a very deep impression on me may there be more of these conferences each year how often does the same theme come through in your story an awakening of black nun power sister martin de porres says the core of the racial problem is basically spiritual its hard for the majority race to know or understand this our culture is too involved with material things even to notice that there arc more heartfelt values we have the siime problems with the nonindians who live near reservations they come to weigh measure observe and count indians they cant believe that there is a worth there that entirely escapes them bless ou for your workbut dont you in misled either into thinking that with money appliances and good homes liappiness will cximc hail to lerone bennett jr and all the other witnesses for the prosecution in the case against sttons nat turner for his forccfid article in your october issue i had plunged my way through this tale of fielion almost to the end i lost count of the number of limes i laid it aside beeaiiso of slyrons nauseating portrayal of our nat i couldnt believe what i was reading after the first few jiages stynns hypocrisy is in evidence throughout his pages and he is an avow ed liberal i unhesitantly label him and all others like him dangerous at least with an atwed racist like cov wallaet and the real thomas gray we know where we stand and what to expect i sincerely thank mr bennett and you editors of ebony for answering my own mental queries about styrons background fualifications intentions etc etc i hope my appreciation of mr bennetts inteiprclation is expressive of countless other young black americans miss clara l breland brooklyn n y i have just finished the article the case against slyrons nat turner oct inns lerone bennett jr hiis exptsed w illiam styron for what he really iscertainly not liberal if turner despised black people as styron tries to lead us to believe there would have been no rebellion stton is just trxing to exploit nat tumer but he did a poor job of it i belie e that styrons lxok should be baniud as a deliberate lie i hope it never comes to the screen his book is an insult to nat tumer and all black people legally sanctioned criminal activity as tile very members and residents of the ghettos themselves what for the sweet love of cod can a human being do on the side of the right for myself i can only imagine education as a partial solution and yet being white i could not even hold a picket sign in front of the easy cash store fronts and be believed the talcs he tells are horrifying i cannot believe there is anything material to be said in defense of the laws which permit such criminal activity as sen vfagniison describes and yet tested would not the lobby ith the money power try to keep on the hooks the laws which in operation are cnielly unjust wliat can a human being do as editor of beacon magazine of hawaii i was extremely gratified to see ebony reprint tlic negro in hawaii from our publication but as author of this piece i was even more pleased and for one of the few times in my life i feel selfishly compelled to stand up and be counted as the writer it appeared anonxtnously only becauseas yoii will understandwe dont like to have the same bylines recurring too frequently particularly those of staff but now id like tlie world to know i wtote this not only for the distinction of appearing in ebonyno small achievementbut far more because my feelings about what i wrote are deep and abiding i feel that there are many of us who never have enough opportunity to express what is to us a totally clear and a totally unsliakeable conviction i am grateful for having had the chance to voice that conxiction to the people of hawaiiand it is this as staled in the article racial prejudice is mans most irrational and ignominious emotion we will continue to fight for riddance of this ignominy and for the honest establishment of a great concept which we here call i am writing about the selection of mo ies for men in tlie service i havent been in this war long but already i have noticed the lack of negroes in the movies we see oh there are some negroes but the pictures tliey are in are usually of the th to th century type where the negro is usually being mistreated or softshoeing this doesnt make the chests swell of those few of us viewing and it certainly doesnt let us share in the many talents that the negro posscsses there just is not much to look forward to when the man sounds moxie call i understand they try to select movies so as not to cause social and racial unrest among the crew because of something they saw at the flick the few of us that there are would like to sec some pictures depicting the tli centuiy negro i realize that this is not your department but i just wonder if others know of our plight or even feel the simie way i do alwiit it miiius d bass uss simon lake fpo new york n y i am an afroamerican in the us air force i am stationed in adana turkey after reading your splendid articles on the black soldiers i could not hesitate in writing you about the social situation on this base at present we have a radio station on base which is in operation hours a day the number of black artists records that are played are small in comparison to the extent of their worldwide popularity i feel a separate program would benefit all concerned because it would expose the black mans contribution to the field of music with this idea in mind i went to the radio station managers of afrts with a suggestion to have a separate program devoted to miusic i explained to them that if they can have two shows daily devoted to country and western music and also separate shows for classical and the more popular rock n roll music thev can have an hour show devoted to sold music the response i rcceied was negative they thought i w as a crazy young radical with nothing else to do but complain about the systeni but i refuse to allow my discontent to go unanswered im writing this letter for help i want to expose this situation to all your readers i want guidance on how i can put pressure on the headquarters of afrts which is located in los ngeles calif i want this situation eradicated if i have to serve in this mans war i want an environment which recognizes my existence alc leroy edwards apo new york n y a jew speaks up as a jew i differ greatly with mrs g potters letter in the september issue of ebony that most of the jevvish wealth was acquired in the negro ghettos if mrs potter will examine the records and the facts she will find that probably only a very small percentage of money comes to jews from black people apparently mrs potter you forget such great depiutinent stores as macys gimbels sachs s klein korvettc blumbergs of san francisco neiman marcus of texas and a host of others i do not know in new york city probably per cent of the clothing industry the fur industr and the jewelry industry is jewish and mrs potter how many black people buy stocks and bonds through such worldfamous companies as bache co and perhaps lesser known ones such jls oppenheimer co dreyfus co model roland a stone carl m loeb rhoades herzfeld stern perhaps you forget financier bernard baruch and the many banks that arc jewish and what about hertz rentacar hartz mountain bird foods the building contractors the countless stores outside the whitemade black ghettos perhaps you forget the great artists such as horow itz millstein isaac stem and the several orchestra conductors like leonard bernstein perhaps you dont think of the many doctors and husyers and the inventors such as dr jonas salk who developed llic polio vaccine or albert einstein lizze meitner who played a decisive part in the development of the atomic bomb mrs potter your talk sounds just like hitler that jews contnd all there probably isnt a jeuash cabinet member and jews do not want to control arab lands mrs potter i do hope you will reexamine the facrs and you will realize tliat black people arc beginning to follow the jews in many waysstore owners theologians funeral parlors manufactiiriiig doctors and dentists lawyers etc name withheld ox request whitestone x y black dissent mrs g potters letter in the september issue expressed concern for the socioeconomic problems facing the black people were all hip to the fact that social irogress can be accelerated tlirough the gaining of economic pow er green power is most certainly an importiint factor in the solutions you advocate green power is part of black_power and education is the key to both she gives little credit to the intellectual insight now guiding the black movement throughout this country she ob iously knows little about the minorities against which she unerringly reveals profound prejudices we question her sources for discussing such topics as our universities tlie history of african intertribal activities black_power and american negro history or jewish history we must all agree that heritage is the cohesive element necessary to maintaining solidarity of iurpose the hlachs need not create their heritage as she suggests because american history is rich with negro involvement this is our true heritage this is americas heritage her suggested solution to the blacks problems that of following the evample set by the hated jews must have been received with a unanimous yiiwn she has not only insulted the blacks but she compounds her error by perpetrating in her own small way the very bigotry that the jews hae withstood the cnix of the issue is not the overcoming of practiced prejudicial discrimination but the elimination of blind hate such as she has illustrated mrs potter do you really believe that you are one of those fairminded white people willing to help them blacks attain their rightful place in american society during my stay here in vietnam got familiar with your magazine i was glad i did because i got facts of the crisis hich is raging before i entered the service i lived in an area which was not confronted with the problem and left me ignorant while going through training and traveling through different parts of the us i was touched by some of the events that took place this made me curious when i came to vietnam i was fortunate to have a negro for a leader he explained some of the major proba chip yes a diamtmd no it takes at least facets to make a diunond the bulova diamond contessa is just lat the name implies a dianramd watch ide with finely cut diamonds lots of lish and shining facets lems which face my brothers as you could pmbably tell i am whitethat is by color only i would give my shirt oflf my back for my brothers when i return to the us i will stand bv mv brothers and fight i am writing to rerpiest that you should not only have pictures of men uearing the natural look but you should also have a section in one of your upcoming editions of women wearing it i recpiest this because t am years old a sophomore in high school and i have a natural in the very sniiill town of east chicago ind where i live the natural look is very seldom seen there are only two high schools and at the one i attend am the only girl wearing it so if im the only girl in town sporting this new look i want it to look good there arent very many people around ihiit could advise me because out here people arent really aware you would be doing me a very big favor if youd just have a few women modeling this new look in one of your upcoming editions all i want to say is i really enjoy your wonderful magazine espccialk your footlail features to me this is the highlight of ei rv ear and i read a lot of magazines in my opinion the oidy thing to match it is your annual featurt on bachclorettes who are by any measure outstanding in their field also i wish you w ould have more of them the bachelorettes because i dont think selections is representative of the entire number aailablc during any one year ill conclusion i want to congratidate you on your very fine writing which appears lliroughout ecry lssiie it is tridy outstanding i like all of your writers although i know none of them personally well thats all for now keep up the good work and keep sending out your editorial messages all over the country in reading the august issue of ebony magazine i noticed two oversights which to me are significant one of these oversights was in the article the black man and the draft and the otlier was in the article the xegro officer both of these ov ersights are in relation to col campbell c johnson col johnson was at the time your articles were published the senior colonel in the united states armv and the senior xegro officer in the anny col johnson was the assistant director of selective service the number three man of the selective service system the inghest post in the system held by a negro col johnson died of a heart attack on august the many outstanding accomplishments of his life appear in resume in whos wio in america your ebony special on the black soldier was great inspiration as well as an cveopener to myself and i presume many of the soul brothers that arc new to the scene here in vietnam ebony deserves a lot of credit for putting on paper how it is over here i have never been more appalled or more indignant about racial injustices suffered by black americans than when learned through your special issue on the black soldier the shameful statistics concerning the ratio of white and black general officers knew that three black generals were disproportionate to the massive black participation in the military but i had no idea of the magnitude of the disparity until you informed me that there are white generals or admirals in the anned forces todav i only hope that everv vomig black man who is toying with the idea of a military career will keep this insult of the military establishment to all black americans in mind before signing his name on the dotted line of an enlistment form thanks for keeping us informed a few ears ago i was a black man only existing from hand to mouth from day to day from humiliation to dehumanization one day while serving in vietnam i suddenly realized in all my torment tliat i was a human being but at that time i still knew little of anything that made up ns as beings i was determined to find out who i was and where i was going i read every book coidd get my hands on that had to do with ns negroes i read about my black people and what happened to them before and after the famous landing of the mayflower about the horrors that beset them as they were chained and forcibly taken from their motherlands went into that old hate bag too man did i hate hated myself to sleep every night only to wake up the next morning hating again i was determined to get my revenge on all whitcys for what they ilid to iny people i was deadserious about this but dumbfounded as to how to go about it then the idea dawned upon me to read about them whiteys tlic army taught me to know more about the enemy before planning battle strategy and so i decided to really get inside of him and for a change exploit this cat and find out what motivateil him to do those things he did to my forefathers my motto then was search for the truth regardless of where it takes me well that search ended just the other day im happy to say that i am now human and proud this is not separate from but only a step alxive being black and proud dont misunderstand me when i sav human instead of black my point is that blackness alone does not necessarily make you better hate is a motivator for many things but the hate bag aint a lasting bag its an empty and lonely bag too you only punish yourself when you hate cause it only works on your body dig we have been here learning a good lesson on how to treat one another cause we have been so mistreated as people now that we have fulfilled ourselves and iire letting the world know that we have pride and dignity i think the message is across now lets put to use our brain power pass this news on to everbodv man womiin and child so that we can get our thing going dig as for ebony well i think i speak for all of the souls youre the greatest anil we at the crossroacls oct neiuly sums up the role of black delegates and the emergence of georgia state rep julian bond at the democratic convention in chicago i too ixlievc that tlie black politician is being challenged to come into his own mere rhetoric is not going to bring this about black politiciansand black people in generalought to be about the business of organizing politically for i mean real hard tiring doorbell ringing unglaniorous organizing of black voters on the precinct leel whats the use of shooting for the presidency if you cant ev en carry your precinct now that the election is over and we can look forward with some misgivings to at least four years of richard nion i can better understand just what took place at the democratic convention and can see that men such as young jidian bond whom our simeon booker described as nonviolent yet dynamic powerful yet compassionate in his black polities at the crossroads and chauiiing phillips of washington d c must be encouraged to stay in the fight strong and understanding young blacks must unite with strong and understanding young whites to make the us a meaningful democracy if this is not done and if cold and impartial force is lised to put down protest god help us in the next few years we greatly appreciate the story dogooder with a record oct your magazine did in behalf of efec efforts from econicts highlighting one of our many successespetey greene petey has set the pace for many people who did nothing with their lives but waste them we are very proud of him and appreciate ebony for recognizing him as the person he is more importantly petey has meant so much to the povertystricken area he seres and has motix ated many to become better and selfsustaining people many of us will go on to better ways of life through efec because petey proves it can be done we look forward to future issues of your interesting magazine about average people and wish you continued success members of efec washington d c tliis letter comes to express my sincere appreciation on the extremely fine article alxut mr petey greene dogootler with a record oct i personally feel that mr greene has come a long way i only xxish we could have more exinmates who would do what he has done to better his condition in life i am sure it was hard for him at first however he provetl to hiinself and the public that it can be done i hope the inmates who are in lorton and the youth center will keep in mind that our lav will come also i am sure bv now that we know this isnt the life i have wondered for years about the fultz quads and what had happened to them thank you for your xery infonnatixe story about them ebony nov and for dispelling the myth that they had reaped a fortune from their appearances in those pet milk co ads people often get the wrong idea about celebrities some think that all celebrities ought to be happy simply lecause thev are famous but vour storv has v shonmi me that sometimes one can achieve supreme happiness and never be known outside ones own family and small circle of friends i lioix that the quads arc able to adjust to their new lives and will become great musical stars mrs bernice j kinchion houston texas in reading your story about the fultz quads i could not help remembering them as cute and very cuddly little girls ho sold me on the alue of feeding my own children evaporated milk i had always associated them with my own children who are xery close to the age of the fidtz girls i look at my daughter and son x ho are both happily married and then i look at the quads and see how their lixes have been so badlv r scarred i thank god that my children haxe misscd some of the unhappiness that seems to haxe befallen those four lox ely girls favorite of mine for a number of years and ive often wondered why the national publications liad never done a feature on him now you have done so and its another example that eboky is really a magazine of the peopleand i mean all kinds of pcoxle not just those who listen only to beethoven re b w hamilton detroit mich i couldnt believe my eyes when i opened my november issue of ebony and saw that beautiful spread on my favorite gospel singer james cleveland i have every album that he has ever made and i rank him above all of the other gospel stars also ive met him and found him to be just the nice sincere person that you described in your story please lets have more stories that highlight the contributions that young people like james cleveland are making to the church world business leadership and the negro crisis edited by eli ginzberg there is general agreement among white and negro leadership that the racial revolution is in trouble and that the last and best chance for constructive movement is through a much greater involvement of the business community this book speaks to all americans but particularly to members of the business community who are coming to

field flagpole christ said a word to the good samaritan and christ to complete it all was black it wasnt a scene from a dali painting it was simply a performance in atlantas baseball stadium of an unusual integrated passion play with a negro clergyman in the role of the lord the event attracted more than becoming as someone later described it the closest thing to a miracle in this city that i can recall in many a yea t he play aside from its artistic intentions was conceived perhaps predictably this year as a gesture of harmony among atlantas citizenry also possibly and more to the point as an experiment in a somewhat more equitable relationship between residents of georgias largest city as frank marshall roughton who directed the play said perhaps symbolically to the sponsoring christian council of metropolitan atlanta its time you got over the old bugaboo that negroes cant play any role except farmhand or chimney sweep to no ones suqrise the ministers agreed what was astonishing to many atlantans was the decision on the part of the business community to pledge some to the cause matters quickly developed from there to house an extiected overflow crowd the atlanta stadium was booked for the occasion on a night when the braves and falcons were away and the affair was advertised among both communities nor were the players completely ignored blacks were recruited for many of the parts in a cast that totaled more than as well as for places in the voice choir to help with sets youngsters were brought in from poverustricken communities throughout the fivecounty metropolitan area the production titled behold the man was a successand for more reasons perhaps than one with rehearsals tliat stretched the length of the summer beginning in june ending in september the event provided the tense atlanta community with a welcome opportunity for an interracial effort also on the purely psychological level the sight of a black man depicting christ may have provided for the integrated audience a needed insight into the nature of their religion its universality its ultimate humanity w hen director roughton who also authored the drama announced his intention to cast a negro as christ the audition he envisioned was an almost mystical one ill be a john the baptist he once remarked ill see his stature and look into his eyes and ill know hes the man roughton then met the rev william holmes borders who as pastor of the wheat street baptist church was one of atlantas most venerated clergymen in the barrelchested man with deepset eyes he saw a rather robust but nevertheless ascetic christfigure who furthcmiore was well knowni among the religious community recalls borders who had never before acted i prayed over it and thought about it and i decided to take the opportunity and do the best i could but borders for all the iower of his portrayal was only one of many negroes involved many indeed in leading roles eelyn taylor who depicted mary is an atlanta housewife and mother of two who acquired her diction and presence on stage during her student davs at the university of michigan where she majored in the training of speech she now seizes as a

duties as choreographer of the scene at herodsjeourt t oday more than ever we need to remember liow mucli we owe the negro if as eric williams said the black man is today the white mans problem he was in the beginning the only solution to that problem the crisis of the hour calls us to a remembrance of beginnings and a prevision of endings it calls us above all else to a remembrance of the hot black fire negroes breathed into the snowy reaches of our souls there is a rather romantic notion abroad that white men give without rccei ing but culture is nothing if not a dialogue the white man has influenced the black man particularly in the area of technicjue but the black man has had a comparable influence on the white man particularly in the area of sensibility in the mind of the south w j cash spoke of the tyranny of the negro over the customs and habits of white southerners negro he said entered into white man as profoundly as w hite man entered into negrosubtly influencing every gesture every word every emotion and idea every attitude black man entered into white man not only in the south but also in the north every area of american lifepolitics labor education religion art recreationhas been greatly conditioned by the pervasic presence of the black american and every white american bears on his body or deeper in his soul the mark of fire of the negro spiritually we are all black in our nonmachine life we are all imitators of the black american wlio has akvays been a ferment in the rather colorless amalgam of american life when c j jung the great psychologist visited america he was astonished by the mark of the black man the first thing which attracted my attention he was quoted as saying was the influence of the negro an obviously psychological influence regardless of any mixture of blood jung went on to say that the influence of the black american was apparent in the walking laughing dancing singing and even the praying of white americans what jung was trying to sayand we didnt need him to tell us thiswas that the black man is deep in the psyche and soma of america his roots are deeper than the puritans black men and women came here long before the mayflower and they cleared the forests drained the swamps and cultivated the grain the wealth of this country was founded on what abraham lincoln called the years of unrequited toil of black men and women from the muted wail of slaves going in chains to american plantations came the gold that made capitalism possible from black brawn came tobacco from black blood white sugar had there been no negroes here had there been no darkness at all tliis would be a pale and a lonely land no negroes what would we sing no darkness what would we dance no blackness what would we fear how would we experience the boundaries and the whiteness of our lives this is not now nor has it eer been a white exjuntry more than ever today we need to remember the contributions of blacks and the black and white roots in the subsoil of our hves for make no mistake about it we cannot understand ourselves if we do not understand the black man and what he has dreamed in this countrv or to put it another way we cannot understand ourselves until we understand the symbolic darkness within and the literal darkness without america would not have been america without black people and america caimot become america until it confronts not only the black people but the gifts the negro bears what is required now is an act of the spirit we must abandon our shallow trenches and confront each other as coinheritors of a common land which is to say that we must meet and know each other as brothers in a marriage of isions as coconspirators in tlie making of a dream as fellow passengers on a journey into the unknown it was from out of the unknown that the negro came bringing with him the gift of the sun billowing out of the slave ships and the embryonic harlems of the plantations was the sun of a fierce and irresistible will to life and the sun within the black man sustained him and made him the white mans greatest eollaborator in the taking of the land the black man endured let us begin with that contribution by the simxdle act of survival the negro made an inestimable contribution to his posterity and to his native land when europeans settled in the wesf indies whole groups of people disappeared from the face of the earth leaving nothing behind but a few bones and artifacts in other places and in other climes brown and red men drank the white mans whiskey read his bible became demoralized and wasted away into nothingness tlie black drank the white mans whiskey read his bible did his workand his tribe increased he descended into the hell of slavery was denied books pencil and paper was denied the sanctity of marriagewas crucified in fact and rose again some three hundred years later in chicago and harlem and atlanta and washington the black man endured tliere is hope in the negros incredible vitalityhope and promise and danger the black population of our fifteen largest metropolitan areasthe urban heart of americais growing hour by hour so is tlie ghetto so is the negros impatience fnistration and alienation take chicago for example there are more than nine hundred thousand black people in chicago soon there will be a million or more the white population is

tide with urban renewal and other fingcrinthedike plans but they are attempting as one writer put it to cure a cancer with dandruff remover week by week day by day the glacierlike ghetto spreads every week more than two hundred housing units change from white to black occupancy the blacks move in the whites move out there are hard words broken windows fights bombs some whites run to the suburbs others move further south or west where months or years later they meet blacks and pick up and run again this has been going on now for yeais but it cannot go on forever chicago and other metropolitan areas are fast approaching joe louis iron law of runmanship whites can run but they cannot hide forever arithmetic time the fourteenth amendment the spirit of the age the black birthrate and the illinois central railroad are against them ten years from now or twenty years from now when blacks comprise from onethird to more than onehalf of the population of our major cities a bill is coming due sooner or later in a good season or a bad season the commonwealth is going to have to decide between the american idea or fascism frederick douglass the great black abolitionist said it one hundred and thirteen years ago we are here and here we are likely to be to imagine that we shall ever be eradicated is absurd and ridiculous we can be remodified changed and assimilated but never extinguished we repeat therefore that we are here and that this is our country we shall neither die out nor be driven out but shall go with this people either as a testimony against them or as an evidence in their favor throughout their generations by going with this people black people have played a large role in the survival of america hundreds of thousands of blacks from bunker hill to vietnam have died for an idea that was not real in their own lives has any other people in any other age had such faith and hopeand received so little charit when lincoln spoke of the mystic chords of memor stretching from ev ery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone the words had meaning in the ghetto black men and women signed the declaration of independence with the blood of their spirit some black soldiers fought in the revolutionary war and more than one hundred and eighty thousand fought for the union and the freedom of their fellow men in the civil war the mystic chords of memory and the graves of black patriots stretch from valley forge to the banks of the rhine when general putnam said dont shoot until you see the white of their eyes black men were there when admiral farragut said damn the torpedoes full speed ahead john lawson was in earshot and his gallantry won him a congressional medal of honor when major pitcairn stormed up bunker hill and said the day is ours peter salem shot straight and true roscoe jamison the negro poet saw the long black lines marching off to make the world safe for democracy and cried out in anguish it is of freedom that the black man speaks and it has been his privilege and his responsibility to remind us of the blood of our birth by continually ra sing the cry of freedom the black man has had an enonnous impact on the american idea of democracy it can be said in fact that the whole history of american democracy is a series of approaches to and retreats from black reality in this struggle the black man has been far from passive charles hamilton houston thurgood marshall and a long line of black lawyers have virtuallv rewritten the constitutional law of this land because of the marshalls and the martin_luther_kings the rights of all men are more secure today by an extraordinary default white americans hae lost all claims to exclusive identification with the deepest insights of their tradition the torch of freedom has passed ironically from the sons of the masters to the sons of the slaves born into mission ordained as it were from birth as an advocate of freedom the black man is the only american who consistently makes an issue of democracy at home and so long as he lives we will not be able to forget the reolution of our birth the black american has played a modest but nonetheless important role as a conser ator of human values he has been a hewer of water here but he has also been a hewer of the human spirit black expressiveness began early in a slim black girl named phillis wheatly came to america in a slave ship within twelve months she was writing fluent english within twelve years she was an internationallyknown poet in this black daughter of the sun brought out a olnme of poems that was the second book published by an american woman this was in an age incidentally when few white womenor white men for that matterread books in this same period bcaijamin banneker a free black man of maryland distinguished himself as an astronomer almanacmaker surveyor botanist zoologist and philosopher banneker also experimented with the velocity of sound

guns and electronic de ices to machines for utilizing atomic energy when americans pick up a telephone buy a pair of shoes or ride a railroad they are paying tribute to the genius of both black and white americans to granville t woods for example who invented a telephone transmitter that american bell bought and jan e matzeliger who revolutionized the shoe industry with a machine for attaching soles to shoes the millions of americans who have been blinded by glaucoma the millions of americans whose lives have been saved bv blood idasina should thank god that blacks came this way they should give thanks for dr percy julian who made a successfid synthesis of the drug physostigmine and dr charles drew who jerfected the blood plasma technique that saved the lives of so many white americans in world war ii americans arc also indebted to george washington carver who revolutionized southern agriculture witli his research on pecans peanuts and sweet potatoes dr daniel hale williams who made what was probably the first successful operation on the human heart dr edward l harris a leading authority on rocket and jet fuels and luther prince who made a key contribution in the development of an automatic brain for the x americas first rocket ship america would not have been america without the contributions of these and other black men and women without paul laurence dunbar langston

in public affairs in addition to the many individual contributions black people have given america the blind fire of their faith black people were brought to america enslaved and taught the word of jesus through some miracle no man can explain some of the slaves believed in the black pews and the jim crow galleries in the sharecroppers cabins and the concrete ghettos some blacks caught a glimpse of the real meaning and substance of primitive christianity and their lighted torch has become a new center of diffusion giving light to all who come within the range of its radiance going straight to the heart of the matter the black slave ga e central importance to that which christians have been fleeing for almost two thousand years the cross were you there when they crucified my lord were you there when they nailed him to the tree oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble in this question one of the deepest utterances on the crucifixion in the whole literature of the western world time and space are annihilated and every man is made a witness and a betrayer of truth the implication here is that the slave was there that he knew something about jesus that no man who did not stand with him or near him could possibly know a long time ago when i was a little boy in mississippi my grandmother used to rock and sing that song i was too young then to know what kind of troubles a black woman in mississippi could have but i remember the way she sang the song and i remember thinking then that the words were insufferably sad and insufferably beautiful looking back now i think i know what she meant then that she was there that she knewat the deepest level of her beingwhat it was like to be crucified on a cross betveen two thieves and more that there were some things in this world that were worth being crucified for my grandmother and her genctation were perhaps the last living witnesses of a religious tradition that surged like billowing flames from the choir lofts and rickety benches of old baptist and methodist churches of a tradition that dared to flesh out that without which religion is a mere sunday morning game the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man the old men and women of this tradition could see the face of god nowhere in mississippi or alabama and yet they dared to dream that he was everywhere everthing they could seethe ropes the walls and the signs made by white christianstold them the world was absurd and capricious at its core and yet they dared out of a terrible and an eloquent hope to bet on that which they could not see saying to themselves to their children to the wind to the mute sky that somethingcall it god call it mind call it spirit call it what you willthat something higher than their masters or the white man was at work in historv in the face of overwhelming evidence to th contrary in the face of lynchings legalized robbery institutionalized degradation they dared to affirm the goodness and the greatness of man what audacity not since paul walked the road to damascus not since the christian church was scandalousand relevanthave men and women dreamed a dream of greater grandeur and one can only hope that they were ushered at last into the presence of an old jew who could say out of the agony and the joy of his own life that the dream thev dreamed was tnie there cannot possibly be a negro anywhere who does not carry somewhere deep within him the embers of that great fire but we must understand and quickly that the faith of the grandmother or the grandfather is not the faith of the granddaughter or of the grandson too many people are dead in the coliseum too many lies have been told for men to believe in the old way if indeed they find it possible to believe at all the wheel of faith is tuniing in the ghetto and the fire is growing cold the black man cannot and will not stand forever in the wings offering the gifts of pain and passion and renewal the black religious tradition speaks to us for perhaps the last s he had sung the role at lausanne and spolcto at london milan moscow the bolshoi theater audience liad called her back for nine encores at covent garden they had given her a rare standing ovation rhythmic applause and shouts of xerrett errett verrett o er and oer again european critics liad acclaimed her as one of the great carmen interpreters of all time but it was new york

dan she is wellversed in italiansicilian cookery which she learned from her motherinlaw now that her career is established miss verrett is ready to get around to something she has been thinking about for a while time now she says to have a babymavbe two f our months ago i left the concnt i left for a variety of reasons but basically i left because i am black they are white and neer the twain shall meet when i say am black i mean i was born black and went full circle from black to whitewashed negro to black again my familys roots go back to georgia alabama and kentucky i was raised in cincinnati ohio though witli several childhood summers spent down home at the risk of irreerence toward a alue held very dearly in my family i ha e to admit that my whitewashing began when upon entering the catholic church recei ed my education at the hands of countless nuns in the cincinnati catholic schools the education was luckily never totally white since i came home to a greatgrandmother whose compensatory education provided me with th songs the sorrows and the stories of our people as she had learned them growing up as she did during the reconstruction era probably educations greatest bequest to me wasin the words of w e b duboisa kind of double consciousness triple even i was black i was american i was catholic and reconciling those polarities has become a lifelong personal struggle my family came into the catholic church in toward the end of my kindergarten year in school though i was quite young i underwent instruction with older children of the family and was accepted for baptism on the strength of what was judged to be a faith beyond my years we all grew in affection and respect for the nun who instructed us and the priest who baptized us so that i dreamed then for the first time of joining religious life and in spite of later adverse encounters with not a few prejudiced religious that ideal always remained tucked away inside me so having come from good black baptist stock and having undergone religious conversion at the tender age of six years and because of the idealism which is concomitant with the religious temperament i entered the sister of notre dame convent in cincinnati in soon after high school graduation i entered i believe with as much surefootedness and as little stargazing as i was capable of at the age of eighteen several priests and nuns had judged me in possession of a vocation and each had in his own meager way tried to prepare me for the total adjustment that was to become neccssa they warned me of the danger of color consciousness but praised my outgoing personality and refinement of manner they felt i could and would make it i had no doubt my family took my entrance into religious life with mixed emotions just as they took my departure from it they felt i knew nothing of what i was doing but they admired me for having the ner e to do it little did i realize when i left them how very much they meant to me nor how very dear their support would become in the years to follow that support was always there both solicited and unsolicited it remains so today my first three years in notre dame were irobably my happiest life lost its complexity there and my world could be reduced to everymans quest for god i reached for the heights attempting to comply with the most minute rules with the greatest fidelity i was completely convinced of the value of this way of convent by saundra willingham life let me add here parenthetically that i am still convinced of its legitimacyfor white people looking upon those years from the perspective of today i realize that even then i began resisting the pressure to become white i used to spend quite a lot of time in the novitiate library absorbing my black heritage the fare was frugal i now know but at that time the sustenance gained from the collected works of paul lawrence dunbar baroness de iluecks friendship house the life of peter clacer and anthology of american folklore kept my waning black spirit nourished i used these tidbits whenever i was called upon in our little homegrown talent shows some of my novitiate friends still remember today my great grandmothers middlestories called such because their beginnings and endings never packed half the punch of their middles i wonder now just how much racial tolerance my middle stories engendered in my fellow novices those who felt free enough to joke with me about my aversion to funerals and bats and strange noises always embellished their anecdotes to make me look like stepin fechit and i was foolish enough to laugh along under the illusion that such stereotypes were part of my slave heritage i felt that so long as eeryone enjoyed them and no one really believed them there was no harm done i of course learned in time that the harm lay in some of my white friends illusions that this was in fact all there was to racial tolerance two incidents occurring at this time stand in relief as illustrative of my first resistance toward the allxervasivc whiteness of the convent subculture it was customary at that time for the grade school teachers to arrange for their seventh and eighth graders field trijjs to mt notre dame the provincial house no itiate and juniorate a kind of recruitment technijue a longtime friend of my family haxxened to be chaperoning the group from my home parish and i remember the joy with which we met and shared a few moments what remark promxted it i cant recall but i remember saying to mrs franklin at the time ill nc er be white ill try to be a good religious but theyll never make me forget my people on a similar occasion a black class from an innercity school visited and i remember my defensie attitude when some novices remarked about tlicir shoddy dresses and unkenqt hair i was fighting ambivalent feelings of accepting or rejectingapproaching or avoiding the kids and such emotions were new to me the directress of no ices was ass ay so i wrote to her of this nesv selfknosvledge divided loyalties i called them my respect for her opinion ssas colossal so that svhen she cautioned me against inordinate raceconsciousness i supxressed svhat i could of those feelings that novice directress was a thoroughly religious woman whose largeness in time became expansive enough to encompass the racial issue and whose religion was real enough to eventually and with some suffering see the truth in the black jrotest those first years culminated in a public profession of the vows this was a momentous occasion in my life and all my faith in god and in the church was brought to bear when i pronounced the words i do vow and promise i could not have known then what was to come if i had i could never have mustered the moral courage necessary oh there was a deep and hidden premonition that the real price was yet to be iaid but at the same time my selfconfidence was at its peak and my esteem for religious life and for notre dame particularly somehow balanced the fear and enabled me to make the leap into the dark after two or three days in the jiiniorate a two year period of apostolic and intellectual formation i was snatched prematurely from the secure womb of mt notre dame and plunged into the cold water bath of teaching in a black school and living in a white community though it proved a painfully healthy experience for me in the end it was at the timeand for two long yearsa nearly traumatic one it is difficult to now assess the reasons for my trauma those years are simply one blur of fear nerves and frustration the one personality that does stand out in my memory is the principal of tlie school where i taughtas near a perfect example of the authoritarian personality as any psychologist will ever find and the antithesis of all that i was or ever hoped to become she was as well convinced of her talent as a teacher of the colored having had several years experience in our dayton colored school this nun gave me a hard time let me make it very clear i experienced no overt discrimination in all my years in the order the abuse i suffered was solely psychological and my relationship with this nun is an example of the kind of friction that became a pattern as the years went on still worse the community with a single exception offered next to nothing by way of support i have been often challenged on this point particularly by black nuns needing to justify their continuance in religious life i simply tell them that the world of the nun is too small a world for me my approach to life being different was therefore wrong i had to break step with them let me explain tlie logical theological objective and philosophical being highly valued in the convent much time and energy is spent in their exercise i happen to be an intuitive kind of person and emotive subjective and provisional besides i showed little patience with longrange planning approaches to teaching for example or to prayer and certain other aspects of cdiiveiit living i think however that i could have accepted this as one of the facts of life had not iny confreres succeeded in making me feel small because of it no one e er said oure wrong and were right but the atmosphere was so all pervasive that even my family visiting but monthly sensed a subtle ridicule in the constant community teasing so instead of taking my ego and building it up religious life like american life in general in relation to the black man contributed to its disintegration ihis was america was in the height of the civil_rights movement and my personal sense of alienation and isolation had began in earnest i used to read such men as dr_king mohandas gandhi and thomas merton trying to establish an inner principal strong enough to be a bulwark against what seemed to me intolerable pressure the march on washington had fired me up the bombing of the three girls in binningham had enraged me the assassination of malcolm_x bad embittered me none of these e ents seemed to capture more than the casual attention of my community a picture i had clipped from the daily paper showing the faces of the marchers in selma expressed to me sointhing of the moral fibct of the black people so i kept it it expressed me one sister in passing remarked that they all looked as though the sun were in their eyes i cried then it was for myself now i grieve over the blindness of that group of sisters who in failing me failed themselves it was after i had begun to attend lectures at dayton universih that i realized how backward i was in relation to the civil_rights movement young people with less experience than i were much more knowledgeable in the history sociology and psychology of our people they were able to argue and challenge while could only sit back in ignorance was humiliated at my state of mind it was white i read i talked to friends i bared my soul to my superiors from every front met only paternalism protectiveness and color blindness remarks were made by well meaning white friends to the effect there are other books in the librar besides those on race i was even at one point mildly forbidden to read any more rac books since they only fed an already hypersensitive ego i became a full time student in the fall of and remained so until graduation in april of two courses studied there left profound impressions the first was american history after the other general anthropology the history course under the genius of the professor and in spite of the racist text laid bare for me the american dilemma the double standard of this socalled democracy my disillusionment destroyed my love for tins country a love by the way that has yet to be restored the anthropology course opened to me totally new concepts and thought patterns i began to see the church stnicture in its sociological context and myself i saw as an example of the classic marginal man that isthe person who living in two cultures belongs to neither the filipino teacher of that course was the first of two professors on campus who i felt understood my position and shared my anguish having been forbidden to participate in any kind of racerelations activities during my first two teaching years i was allowed now to join a campus group involved in open housing this was the time of the stokely carmichaelblack_power era and quite a controversy arose on campus over his visit there i wrote a letter to the editor of the campus newspaper and submitted it to the scrutiny of my superior i later learned that she allowed me to submit it only after taking the letter to a priest on campus in order to obtain his advice about letting me get involved in so inflammatory an issue that incident revealed to me that i was not free at least not under that superior to take a public stand on the issue that was most personal to me i became increasingly more ocal more and more militant with some undertones of bitterness becoming detectable never could i walk away from a news broadcast for example unmoved as i watched black heads being bashed in from st augustine to detroit as i listened to black voices crying freedom now and black_power as i contemplated the commitment unto death of dr martin_luther_king i began to ask myself some very basic questions i knew deep down inside myself that it was wrong for me to waste valuable psychic energy justifying my identification with the movement to people whose concern could not ha e been more casual and those in community who had a genuine concern were straight away turned off by my unwillingness to discuss the negro problem as an academic exercise hypersensitivity reversed prejudice monomania this was the feed back sensed from e en the youngest and most liberal a few a ery few stood by me during these trying months and they to a great extent comprised the human relations committee that exists in the province today in retrospect i realize that much education was going on and that in spite of the resistance some truth was coming through it became increasinglv clear to me that i had to make a choice between the white authoritybound institution into w hich i had put myself and the black race into w hich i was born for a long time believed that choice both undesirable and unnecessary i had hoped that the two were not mutually exclusive however time and exposure to both institution and individual racism both in the church and in the nation forced the inevitable choice probably the most difficult attitude for my wdiite confrercs to maintain w ith any kind of consistency was the realization that i was black the product of a black family and a black social milieu we therctorc addressed ourselves to the race issue from two ery different frames of reference it might not have ben so difficult to communicate had they not been so thoroughly imbued with the religious ideal that all men are sons of god and brothers of one another this made considerations of color inadmissible if onlv people would realize that there is no difference it neer occurred to them that they themseh es were products of a racist societygrowing up as most did in insular white security entering religion in most cases ne er disturbed the insulation i of course protested people in fact do not realize on the living leel that all men are brothers it is therefore wrong to dismiss the real w ith an ideal i find it hard to believe now how elemental these arguments were no wonder then that even after the black man reached in their minds the stage beyond zero taking on some positive dimension as an entitv with which to be reconciletlthey still found it difficult to see his position realistically acceptance of negroes first meant to them w ithout exception in my expcrience a mental assent to the fact that blacks are really no different than whites if i had know n the cliche blaek and beautiful in and i would have used it as it was i could only stumble around my reason for refusing to release my heritage for theirs i refused as well to leave them under the illusion that any black man desired such i finally did after a pie of years of attempting to express the differences in lay terms establish a sociological apologia on negro values and customs with which i countered the idealistic position of the sisters concerning the racial situation in this country and eventually i learned to express openly my love for black spirituals black art black eveiy thing i spent many of our recreation periods dancing cultivating in this way quite a reputation as well as several good partners the very tight bonds within my family were always a source of pride to me and though because of the size the income the habits of my folks i was never the recipient of the gifts the visits or the letters that the white nuns were occasionally i felt the contrast this never eclipsed my realization of the deeper sharing that always was ours in fact as the years progressed my family was a greater support to me than my community all this is not to say that plain old crude racism was entirely absent it reared its ugly head in most subtle ways for example was once stopped in a convent corridor by a dear old irish nun vho very deliberately took me in head to toe then came out with well you are very neat about your clothes others not quite so old would ask me how do the children accept you in school often their actions would speak louder than words tliere is one convent which i could never visit without being hauled into the kitchen or lasement to meet the colored help because it was no secret how i felt being the only one in most situations not a lot of display was attempted but on various occasions i was pulled out of class or chapel or community room to meet so and so who is thrilled that we have you with us eventually i became suspicious of each and every effort to bring attention to myself and acquired the habit of asking why me before accepting any offer to put myself on display for any occasion whatsoever this of course only reinforced my reputation for hypersensitivity as time went on i became progressively more defensive i shared the fruits of my study and experience only with the most trusted and liberal of my friends at the same time i was becoming more and more sure of the defensibility of my position visavis race my sociological training was being supplemented by the reading i did of involved theologians like harvey cox william stringfellow and philij and daniel berrigan who convinced me that the call to redemption is a constant call a contemporary call i began to believe tlien as i do today that the black man expresses that call in the th century not only in america but all over the world so i simply refused to argue about it i became tight lipped and in some ways defensiveand progressively more lonely my final year in religious life was as dickens put it the best of times and the worst of times i was free at last no doubt about it could come and go as i pleased in what i felt by this time to be my deeper vocation i went to meetings and arranged programs and occasionally gave talks on the racial issue while at the same time continued to teach in the parish school it did not take me long to discover however that physical freedom was my only liberty psychologically i was still ham strung and in the subtlest of ways the more actively i involved myself in the catholic interracial council the more threatened my fragile psychic equilibrium became i eventually had to ask myself how i could justify such total identification with this institution which was not only white but so racist and authoritarian that it cannot accept the factual reality that its schools were segregated so racist that it cannot comprehend the message that the dirth of black vocations is testifying so racist that it does not even know the meaning of the word paternalism and is far indeed from seeing itself implicated therein i began to ask myself further and after some particularly harrowing experiences in narious parishes throughout the city if against the backdrop of the present black revolution i could continue to be exhibit a for tlie totaland profoundly insidious integration lie slowly iinpercepticly there was evolving in me the conclusion that in choosing to be a religious sister first and a black woman only secondarily i was lying about my acceptance of what is culturally mine i was forfeiting my birthright selling my soul i knew as far back as november of last year i guess that it was onlv a matter of time once i was in conference with a sister discussing bonhoelfers cost of disciple ship y when i mentioned my mental dilemma of violence versus nonviolence and how dietrich bonhoefer had personally reconciled the same problem she immediately flared up in a storm of hurt and fear saying how unfit she was to administer our integrated school since she would never personally measure up to my demands of education for black children nothing that said could restore communication between us was stunned i had never said that but she was right actually felt that way after that the slightest advertency to race was always couched in the gentlest of terms eventually i went my way and the community went their ownin peaceful coexistence with the coming of the summer of my five years of temporary profession were over and i became eligible for the final perpetual vows which i decided to forego i did this with much deliberation and not a little pain i did it because i felt the wall between the races had grown too tall too deep and too thick for a single individualan individual with my psychological and emotional makeupto bridge what said above neer the twain shall meet i meant though i believe sincerely in the possibility of reconciliation of the races on a small scalethis i believe because i have profound experience of iti have little hope in the possibility of such a reconciliation on the larger social level the america that i see has not the moral wherewithall or national integrity enough to make the total conversion that is necessary if the black man is to become a fully participating totally functioning member of society so left religious life it was too much like the rest of america to retain me now should the blood begin to flow neither i nor anyone else will wonder who i am or where my loyalty is w illiam d bowman works in the twilight zone between the present and future between the pokey highway vehicles of today and the highspeed craft of the drawing boards which while tending to fly he must keep on the ground bowman is an auto aerodynainicist a member of a relatively new and thoroughly incouspicuous profession wliich nevertheless influences everyones daily life from his desk in the ford motor cos research and design center in dearborn mich he manipulates design to increase stability and windworthiness and to decrease noise his eflforts focus on six aerodynamic phenomena to me he says an automobile is six numbers and six graphic curves he means drag lift yaw xitch roll and side force and his primary tool is the wind tunnel bowman was bom in houston and reared in youngstown ohio he got into automobile aerodynamics through a roundabout circuit that began in the early s while he was a student at the massachusetts institute of technology and was completed by an accident at ford in he explains that he was interested in aerodynamic engineering while a student but decided to take his degree in mechanical engineering specializing in fluid dynamics and heat transfer after graduation he joined the national aeronautics and sace administration nas to work in the area of his undergraduate specialty he says he liked the work but that the military overtones of nasa began to wear him down i didnt want to sdcnd my life in a military orientation he explains i didnt like sjending it in something with the ultimate objective of killing jeople his next step was to the heat transfer department of ford in a continuation of the specialty he had developed at nasa he researched and tested auto radiators but not for long in ford was struck with an unprecedented calamity the models furnished with a larger engine than the xjrevious years were not as fast as the s on paper they should have been but in those days aerodynamics was not in the carmakers repertoire testing showed that it was aerodynamic drag that slowed the ford and the company taking the cue set out to discover what else the air could do to a cars performance bowman long interested in aerodynamics was enrolled in the investigation from the beginning in the past years he has studied about auto body tyies and has succeeded to the position of senior research engineer in charge of the design centers aerodynamics section his job is multifaceted he tests every body design ajproved for commercial jroduction conducts research for future models and jiartieijdates in the designing of experimental racing and highsxeed cars he has also worked on truck models and frequently tests grills which despite their seeming inconsequence can if imxroxerly constructed suffocate an engine and although cmiunercial automobiles are not yet designed for speeds at which aerodynamics would predominate over aesthetics the work of the auto aerodynainicist today insures adequate stability in almost all wind conditions for bowman this means fulfillmenta successful transition from militarily aimed engineering to lifesaving innovations in auto building b owman does most of his testing with threeeighths sized facsimiles in the university of maryland wind timnel the ford tunnel he explains was designed to test climatic conditions other than windheat cold moistureand its limitations can be stretched only far enough to permit drag investigations the company does maintain a small wind tunnel for studying grills the aerodynamic work comes into the auto production schedule just after the basic design of a new vehicle is determined which is three to four years before the car is put on the miuket an american automobile begins with what ford engineers call a package a compilation of numbers based on market surveys that describe everything a car must contain and what it must do the package goes to designers who provide it with a surface in detroit lingo the first milestone the designers must reach is a theme or basic design it is at this theme stage that bovvman gets involved from the theme dev eloped on a fullsized model the aerodynainicist creates a threeeighths sized fiberglass replica this scaleddown model which contains a simulated underside and dummy engine compartment costs more than the car itself averaging about the replica is transported to the wind tunnel from which bowman returns with figures indicating exactly how the car will handle how fast it will go and how much gas it will consume giv en any of a variety of engines gears and axle ratios the wind tests also determine the appropriate locations for heat and v entilating intakes and allow the acrodynamicist to catch major haws in stability in addition they permit him to evaluate the cars noisiness his advice is then incorporated into the cars final design by the artists and other engineers every car chosen for production is put through the aerodynamic tests according to bowman the biggest problems an automobile engineer must deal with are his own personal preferencesspecifically keeping them out of the way when he is working with a model he dislikes for either aesthetic or practical reasons bowman himself seems to have overcome the problem when i look at a car he says i try to make sure i am like a doctor looking at an appendix he has apparently accepted the habits of compromise that permeate an auto plant he acknowledges that an aerodynamically jerfect veliicle would not be saleable in the american market and extrapolates that an unsaleable car means a doomed auto industry which in turn suggests a wrecked economy the public he says must get the kinds of cars they want and within the limitation of todays auto industry he is content to focus on safety and comfort bowman who has been married for years has vvtitten several papers on automobile aerodynamics for the society of auto engineers of which he is a member and the american institute of aeronautics being one of the first thoroughgoing researchers in a new field his expertise though little knovvm is established w hen bowman clips into his bag of automotive knowledge he comes up with some tidbits that are guaranteed to satisfy the curiosity of many drivers sharpen the purchasing eye of others and surprise almost all who would guess for example that the station wagon variant of each american car model is more aerodynamically sound than the models basic sedannot only handling better in a crosswind but losing less of its speed to drag that at inph the aerage american passenger car has pounds less weight on the ground than when standing still that a station wagon can be thoroughly ventilated by cracking the window in the tail gate or that the most consistently noisy part of a car is its rain trough or driprail in automotive vernacular and who would guess that a choppedoff racing back when cut short will actually slow a car dowu the primary forces operating on a car as it moves through the air according to bowman are drag the tendency of an interrupted air flow to retard forward motion lift the tcmdency of the car to rise like an airplane wing or like a reversed wing to press toward the road and pitch the tendency of the car to nosup or nosedown at high speeds a crosswind imposes three other forces on the automobile yaw the tendency to swivel or spin the car roll the tendency to rock it from side to side and side force the tendency to slide the different body types react to these forces in varying ways a fastback for example will encounter less drag than a sedan but will exhibit more lift and pitch tending to nosedowm a remedy for the fastbacks pitching is the addition of a spoiler a transverse ridge along the back of the trunk but the spoiler will increase the cars drag roughly according to bowman a square and edgy vehicle is more stable than a rounded one decisively so where the rear is thoroughly squared although the edgy car is more vulnerable to side forces he explains it is much less susceptible to yaw and drag the aerodynamically ideal car he suggests would be one with a rounded front to minimize side forces on the steering control and a squared back he offers however that such a car would have little aesthetic appeal and since detroit thrives on compromises between practicality and beauty no such american car is expected to be seen in the near future lift bowman says has not yet become a problem in american cars because detroit products are heavy ones their weight keeps them on the ground at their designed speeds lift and the closely related phenomenon of pitch are however great potential problems bowman relates the story of a racing car the company designed then hastily abandoned at mph he says the car would have nosedup so much that only pounds would have presscd on the front wheelsnot enough to steer a crosswind wotdd have scooped up the front and flipped the car the surest remedy to lifting forces bowman says is a smooth underside in its present stage bowman explains american auto engineering attributes greater importance to stability than to styling but puts more emphasis on styling than on drag reduction you are the mozart of the th centtir exclaimed metropolitan museum of art director thomas hoviiig as he listened to pianist tony rolle strong praise indeed for an eightyearold whether or not tony is a new mozart he is becoming a master of tlte piano and possesses say his admirers an artistry seen rarely in the very young tonys stature pounds enhances his performances onlookers stare in awe at the youngster as he dashes off a chopin etude with a deftness that belies his two years of study chopin is tonys favorite pianist but he also loves to play the works of schubert beethoven mendelssohn and bach and he plays them all somewhat leaning on the piano stool to reach the pedals with his short legs his mentors say that tonys playing is brilliant he has an understanding of tonal color and phrasing and a sense of professionalism thats rare in someone so young all this has come during just two years of study with madame annett zuch in new york city when tony first began to play madame zuch withheld encouragement but changed her opinion when she saw him become increasingly interested in the piano he progressed rapidly under her tutelage and her methods have not altered the little boy in tony he is still innocent playful charming and eager for knowledge as well as for fun and games on the other hand he is aware serious about his music and determined to become as accomplisbed a pianist as his talent and ability vvill allow him to become tony is the youngest of howard and pearl rolles four children the family livcs in its own home in brooklyn and tonv and his yearold sister sharri attend the national academy of dance and theatre arts in manhattan tony is in the fourth grade two grades behind sharri wanting for tony what she always yanted for herself mrs rolle urged him to study piano a tight family budget preyented him from starting eyen earlier than he did looking for a negro child to complete enrollment in an international group of piano students madame zuch discovered the boy she is an officer of the foundation for universal brotherhood and thus obtained the foundations sponsorship for her new protege madame zuch and her husband dr michael zuekal the founderexecutive director of the foundation have taken a continued interest in tonys development tony is now a veteran of television having appeared twice on the sonny fox show and once on the johnny carson tonight show victor borge filling in for the vacationing johnny carson was visibly impressed when tony played a chopin waltz followed by a demonstration of his sense of pitch tony can unfailingly identify a note or chord from across the room tonys latest appearance on cleveland amorys talk show left amory searching for superlatives at home tony shares his artistic ambitions with sharri who has studied ballet for seven years with george balanchine at the school of american ballet yet she is far from envious of her brothers early success instead she encourages him and eagerly awaits tonys public appearances so she can go backstage with her brother to meet the show business personalities despite the hours tony must spend daily on practice he still has time to devote to homework and such pleasures as watching television and fixing his innumerable toys at eight years old he is not yet ready for the concert hall but music devotees agree he is a lad to watch under the coaching of madame zuch the encouragement of his family and friends and with the advice of other artists he may one day appear before major critics and concert audiences says the enthusiastic madame zuch tony has a very rare talent he is a child prodigy who has perfect pitch and more important he wants to give his music to others to play for the poor and for other children there is no doubt in my mind we will all be hearing moremuch more from tony as a social worker and a black woman i feel the agonies of secondclass citizenship very deeply recently i have come to feel that the conditions of our cities have made all people secondclass citizens in some respects i visit cities and walk through their streets breathing air thats not fit for anyone to breathe i hear the constant rumble of traffic and i feel its vibration in the soles of my feet i see the grime caked on windows walls sidewalks and parked cars and shudder as i realize that this dirt is going into our lungs then i think that life in todays cities is no picnic for anyone black or white youre a secondclass citizen when you live like this take the very simple things like trying to get around in the city shopping in the stores or just trying to find a place to relax and see what problems they have become passing any corner where people wait for public transportation you can see crowds and theyre not all black and i know that everybody is afraid to walk the streets after dark all you have to do is pick up the latest paper to know why idrivealongthe roads near rivers and see all the stuff that floats on the water and smell the sickening odor its everybodys river and it flows by luxury apartment buildings as well as slum dwellings theres nothing first class about any of it for any of us life is hard enough for both black and white without the extra burdens that city life brings today so weve got to ease those burdens ifwecan makeourcities free of filth free of the overwhelming problems that affect everyone i believe wed find a new spirit of pride and optimism in this country and with that spirit well all become first class citizens in every respect the future of our cities depends on what we do now today its a job that must rest primarily with government but its a job that also needs the help of business and labor and private citizens inside and outside the slum white and nonwhite alike concerted action now can be effective thats why we ask you to act directly and vigorously in this crisis perhaps you can join a project where you work or join a civic group or find others who think as you do and start a group yourself there are ways you can help even as a single individual yslt as businessmen we are dismayed at the economic consequences should we fail to heed this call to action as men we are appalled at the prospect of greater personal tragedy what about you whoever you are whatever you do you in your own way can help for suggestions about kinds of constructive action you can take send for the free bookletwhose crisis yours t o build a better mousetrap has never been the ambition of frank mann of pacoima calif but this retired aerospace engineer has built from scratch a lie steam model railroad walued at a perfect replica down to the smallest detail it includes a complete freight train a passenger train with vista dome and pullman cars a repair shed two railroad stations and a complex of tracks and switches the prize of his collection is a giant working model of the texan the famous locomotive that was used by the santa fe railroad to haul long trains across the plains not only is the model considered by experts to be the largest of its type in the world but it was also constructed in record time mann fashioned the complex engine in his backyard shop in only weeks working hours a day seven days a week gifted with a knack for all things mechanical mann tackled his first model locomotix e back in he realized that there were thousands of parts to be made by hand or tunied out on a lathe but before a single part could be made he needed blueprints to work from these he provided himself starting with a few sketches found in an encyclopedia mann spent weeks bent over his drawing board working out each phase of the plans with slide rule and calipers with a good set of plans he recalls the rest was easy i just followed directions his fellow hobbyists in the los angeles live steamer club a group devoted to model railroads were amazed at his handiwork a charter member of the club had been the late walt disney who once gave mann a railroad switch as a gesture of friendship presently the switch is a working part of manns backyard line but ecntually he hopes to make it into a memorial to disney manns greatest thrill however has come not from the awe of other enthusiasts but from the loads of laughing youngsters of all races and creeds whom he has given free rides on his line his railroad is so popular that it might ha e repaid him sexeral times ox er the thousands of dollars he put in itif he had accepted money but he nex er has as he says doing good for other people has made me rich in other xvays d oing the unusual has been the way of frank maim throughout his nearly years at the age of the native texan designed built and flew his own monotype airplane and later toured as a stunt flyer as a high school student in houston he constructed a car on a ford frame that could do mph he followed family tradition by attending prairie view a m college in texas but that was where tradition ended mann went off to serve as a soldier of fortune for ethiopias emperor haile selassie and during world war ii became a first lieutenant in the u s air force flying combat missions as a wing commander with the th fighter squadron returning to civilian life mann settled in california and delved into automobile mechanics for a second time in while making a living creating custom cars for hollywood personalities he designed and built the baby ee sabre which was chosen by motor trend magazine as outstanding sports car of the year all along in his spare time mann had been entering and winning drag races and motorcycle competitions with modified vehicles after graduate studies in engineering at the university of minnesota mann worked in the aerospace field for the lockheed and sunstrand corporations now he is retired and it is model railroading that has engaged his seemingly insatiable mechanical curiosity and again he has excelled the trophies that fill one corner of his living room in pacoima represent the many pursuits of this unusually versatile man who admits if i died tomorrow the world wouldnt owe me a thing beheve me ive tried just about everything there is o nly one thing compares with frank manns love of mechanics this is his genuine fondness for people when perfect strangers arrive at his home for free minirailroad rides they are greeted with a big smile and wann handshake he has even set up picnic tables in his yard so that families can spend the day now mann is preparing to undertake another oneman community relations project but this time it will be in the sky he intends to build an unusual propdriven delta wing plane in his home workshop it will seat four people experienced pilots and engineers blink when he tells them of his plans but nobody who knows him well doubts his ability to do it in fact a number of them have already made reservations for the first flights r clotilde dent bowen is a physician and a psychiatrist but instead of a white coat

their faces for even if the lady appears unassuming she is a full colonel in the u s army the first and onlv woman negro colonel those gis have ever seen to dr bowen this male reaction to her rank is amusing they take a good look at me she muses and can see theyre saying to themselves good griefwhat is this after her fellow rniy officers and colleagues get to know her better she reports they still look at her curiously the question they all finally ask me is tiow did vou become a colonel what is vour secret for success col bowen modestly shrugs in reply to this final query although she admits that she has received rapid promotions after serving only six years of active duty in the reser es she is one of two women doctors promoted to full colonels col bowen is presently based at fitzsimons

pioneering spirit or so col bowen thinks right from the start she ran into opposition because of her sex which appeared to be much more of a handicap than race at least in my case she remembers but she was not deterred she savs i had always wanted to become a doctor ever since i was four years old but then mv family didnt think a woman could survive in medicine it took a lot of determination on my part but i did it and along the way i found out that a negro woman can make whites respect her abilities people who scream prejudice and give up could never have made it anyway col bowen grew up

was traditional allamericanwhite bright and polite he was asked whether it mattered to him and his facsimiles across the land that the negro was written into the page of u s history with invisible ink the boys reply was immediate american history without the negro is only a partial american history partial american histoia has been the bill of fare in the nations schools since the first bell rang and it shows rep james h scheuer dny who wants congress to create a presidential commission on negro historv and culture savs that if american history had been written as it happened in the first place we probably wouulnt have todays blackwhite confrontation history teacher william l katz author of eyewitness the negro in aineriean history agrees we ha e to pledge to teach the truth to let the chips fall where they may he adds this warning some of those chips are going to soil the flag mr katz has some theories about how the negro got pushtd out of american history the early historians searched until they found the records left beliind by white americans but they necr hunlcd for the papers and letters about and by the negro most historians since then hae simply rewritten early works he says perpetuating the errors and myths and leaving out what was always left out the reason eyewitness is different is because mr katz dug out original sources whercmt he could find them another fault he savs is that the southern ersion of the negro in pre and postcivil war america became the national ersion and the dixie ersion he says w as based on the assumption that the negro was happy as a slave and the closer he could be kept to slas ery the happier he and the w hite man would be obeisance to the southern point of viewv was due in large measure to the nations attempt for maiw ears after the civil war to win back the allegiance and support of the defeated confederacy unfortunately savs mr katz wx tried to bind up the wounds of tlie a il war by using ngroes as bandaids dominant w hite america chose to ignore the negro or to remember him only in denigrating myths and stereotypes lr katz believes the historv books on the shelves in our libraries and classrooms deliberately or ignorantly encouraged and fortified the fateful decision today years after crispus attucks and years after the civil warthe new jersey legislature in joint resolution can accurately state it is possible to complete four years of high school in new jersey or probably anywhere in the united states without having even superficial knowledge of the significance of slavery to united states history conditions of negroes during and after the slae period and their innumerable acts of bravery as well as the general history of negroes in this country including their contributions in all fields but it is also possible in for mrs thelma d perry an official of the association for the study of negro life and history to say from my reading of new history texts or reviews of them im sure there is a major change taking place the roll call of states accompanying this article testifies to the change mr scheuers bill is evidence and there are a host of other signs from coast to coast there also are danger signs on the catchup road in american history making the right changes for the wrong reasons and overreaction leading to misrepresentation or superficiality and there is the gnawing doubt that the textbooks the teachers and the nations conscience ha e reacted and reformed in time courtney brown of the new york state human rights commission told a summer conference on negro history sponsored by the westchester regional education center you can no longer discuss this as chit chat you as educators dont ha e much choice you represent the last frontier of reason time is running out it is the concensus among all concerned with putting the black back into american history hat the best way to do it is to describe the negro accurately and naturally as a participant in and contributor to the life of the countr and this should be done in the elementary social studies curricula and us history courses required of every child in americas public schools in a recent survey of superintendents by

historyculture a superintendent of a small district in oregon wrote this brief comment over that entry no negro students he badly missed the point that has been missed for as long as anyone can remember if it is wrong to deny the negro a record of his past it is equally wrong to cheat the white student who like the boy quoted in the beginprlnee hall was one of most ontstandiiig men in revolutionary and postrevolutionar periods among his deeds organization of first black miisonic lodge nmg is resentful when he realizes hes only half educated in american history and only half prepared for the american future in fact the allamerican white student was embarrassed and angry when he related this incident a white man came up to me and said africans have contributed nothing to history i disagreed per cent but i wasnt equipped to answer him i just couldnt answer it was a black student who best illustrated how the near omission of the negro in american history disadvantages the white student rolando tliorne is a senior at george washington high school in new york city hes president of the student council an honors student in historv he said i think white students feel they have been shortchanged that somethings been left out i know more about them than they know about me i have an advantage rep scheuer said it is probably more imidortant to reach the suburban white than the ghetto negro with a true and integrated record of american history at the westchester conference participants spent part of the day listing xrobleins and solutions related to teaching about the negro jast and iiresent someone mentioned that change will not come in allwhite communities because there is no pressure from negroes another iarticixant gave the answer if its american history its american histor and you teach it aon cant choose not to at the same conference dr emilio rivera dean of secial manhattanville college in purchase ny said school districts must ask themselves whv thev want to teach m about the negro in american history is it to keej the black_power xeoxle away from the door is it to make the poor blacks feel better or is it because blacks and whites should have a more accurate xieture of american history where reform is taking xiace in the nation it most often takes the form of suxxlementary material or an elective course on ust negro history rep scheuer who hoxes a presidential commission will recommend the best routes to reform says these stexs are good as beginnings but negro history has to be an integral xart of american history he added others interviewed said the addition of an elective in negro history in high sciiool is no answer few students take the course and besides black and white histon are one thread said rolando thorne if negro history is not incoiporated into the traditional american history courses but is taught sexarately we re going from one extreme to another the only axproach to follow is this is the way it hapxened both black and white live in the same countr were all americans and we need to know about each other teacher and author william l katz agrees that negro and white history are insexarable but if only because the acconnlishments and contributions of the nejro have generally been ignored he thinks that supplemental material is akso needed e erything cant be integrated into one u s history text he says his book published by pitman publishing corp includes a lot of data which would be hard to get into one history text for instance when mr katz was teaching histoi at woodlands high school in hartsdale ny one fact that his white students were impressed by and ne er forgot was that two or three of every eight cowboys driving cattle up the chisholm trail were negroes revising u s history texts properly takes time mr katz says some publishers have simply thrown in a few negro statistics or pictures rep scheuer said one publisher colored some of the laces in a group picture of whites but he forgot to color the hands too said mr scheuer mrs perry of the association for the study of negro life and history said textbook publishers should not stick in a negro here and there in an old text the books need rewriting everybody knows in his heart whether hes been included or excluded some revisions u s history textbook publishers can make and have been making slowlyinclude the following not all negroes in the early days of the nation were slaves a number were indentured servants or freemen many negro slaves were artisans ajid craftsmen before thev left africa or were trained in these skills after arriving in america slav ery was not a happy institution many negroes were mistreated and rebelled there were abolitionists in both north and south and not a few of them were negroes freed negroes were among the most able and most brave of the union soldiers during the civil war in the reconstruction period the majority of new negro legislators were honest and able considering that as slaves many had not been permitted access to basic education between reconstruction and the civil_rights movement of the s and s the negro did not disappear he made contributions in every field within years after the civil war he was awarded patents negroes have served with distinction in all of americas wars mr scheuers bill to create a national commission on negro history and culture has passed the house and is awaiting senate action he is convinced the bill will become law one of the key elements the commission may deal with is teacher training teacher irving sloan in

subject merrill hartshome executive secretary of the neas national council for the social studies admits his organization hasnt helped a great deal to put the black back into american history we havent done much of anything in this area he said hes also pessimistic about the job colleges are doing to train social studies teachers to integrate the negro into their courses many colleges are not dealing with it theyre bnishing it off he said elmer pfleiger supervisor of social studies in detroit is more optimistic each year it seems there are more teachers who have been prepared to teach the role of the negro in american history at the westchester conference on the negro in american history dr jack kleinman executive secretary of the neas commission on professional rights and responsibilities said we have to get teachers to accept the truth themselves and teach it thirty years ago the schools asked if they dared to build a new social order they didnt dare instead the social order became one of traditional institutions perpetuating the myths of the past perhaps the nations schools are now ready to teach american history as it happened with the negro in perspective

dark brown skin then other spots began to develop around her eyes soon they spread all over her exceptionally pretty face that was six years ago and now emily juana burke an art teacher in washington d c has turned almost complctely white because of a skin condition vitiligo though vitiligo affects about one per cent of the us population juanas is a rare case for seldom is the whitening process so complete partially it is because of a decision she had to make when she first considted dermatologists at washingtons freedinens hospital attempts were made to restore her natural pigmentation through drugs and hours of sitting in the sun meanwhile she wore dark makeup to conceal lier ailment when the whitening continued to progress her only alternatie was to undergo another treatment that would speed up the change now it is nearly complete but juana asserts wanted to remain tlie color i was born i n the case of juana burke color is more than skin deep for the personable young teacher retains her old sense of black pride and identifies with her people she continues to work at a predominantly black school and has the same friends if anything her racial attitudes have become stronger as a black woman who looks white she has had an opportunity to witness american racism from a unique vantage point its not just a change in concrete things she says of her dealings with whites but most of all its a change in the way they treat youwith a more courteous attitude i have found that most whites have very negative attitudes toward black people they constantly make derogatory statements once she and a dark girlfriend went to a maryland agency looking for employment juana was graciously called in and offered a good position for which she had no experience but she recalls my girlfriend was offered a lowpaying job in a wayout area and told that she would have to pay a fee i wasnt even asked for a fee both girls declined the jobs she recalls one time when a white woman got on a bus with her purse wide open and then whispered to juana a nigger tried to pickpocket my purse when juana whispered back to her that she was a negro she says the woman almost fainted once a white coworker in a maryland department store she remembers invited her to attend a ku klux klan meeting t was very tempted to go says juana but the fear of being discovered as the only black person in a gang of ku kluxers stopped me there has been little change in her relationship with other black people though they too have mistaken her for white while doing volunteer work at resurrection city she relates i attended a meeting from which all whites liad been barred i was sitting there all comfortable when i glanced up and saw a man staring at me in unconcealed hostility it was nervewracking as soon as the meeting was over i rushed ov er to him and told him mv storv he smiled and said should have told him sooner that was a soul sister since the color change she has lost one boyfriend explaining he just couldnt adjust to my new color when i first saw him walking down the street after the change i called out to him he turned and didnt even recognize me we saw each other a couple of times after that but think he felt very uncomfortable with me these and similar experiences have made juana very pessimistic about the future of race relations in this country but she for one knows where she stands when asked if she has ever thought of slipping over to the other side she replied emotionally no nol no indeed never she has obviously made her choice b ranch rickey originally intended to announce the contractual signing of jackie robinson as the first negro in organized baseball after the football season ended at a time when the announcement would get the most extensive co erage in the press but racialdiscriminationinbaseball almost suddenly became a political issue in new york politicians who previously had expressed little or no concern for the welfare of negro players poped up now in their comer times were changing and with them attitudes political pressures on behalf of negro players forced rickey to make the robinson announcement much earlier than originally planned explaining later what had happened xrthur mann rickeys assistant close friend and biographer said soon the question of the negro in baseball was like a bone among dogs rickey had been a member of new york city mayor fiorello laguardias antidiscrimination subcommittee for baseball rickey resigned mann said because he felt that with the secret signing of a negro player his position among the group would not be a sincere one new york governor thomas e dewey had appointed a state committee to implement the ivesquinn law this committee asked the new york yankees new york giants and brooklyn dodgers to institute a policy of fair employment club officials refused to sign a pledge that they would do so in midoctober mann reported laguardia asked his committee to let him report by radio that baseball would shortly begin signing negro players and that the fact resulted directly from the mayors committee on antidiscrimination rickey told laguardia that he would like another week and asked the mayor to postpone his broadcast laguardia agreed to do so rickey wired jackie robinson instructions to fly to montreal canada the announcement that he had signed an organized baseball contract was made in montreal on october when hector racine president of montreals international league team the royals summoned representatives of press and radio to a conference none of them suspected that october was to become a great day in baseball history mildly speculative writers and broadcasters arrived at racines office at the appointed time they wondered whats the story has montreal been admitted to the major leagues did the royals fire a manager tliey were surprised by racines announcement that the royals through the brooklyn dodgers had signed a player named jackie robinsonthe only negro present racine explained that robinson had signed a contract calling for both salar and bonus that he was the product of rickeys threeyear search for negro talent that he had signed the contract following a conference with racine lt romeo gauvreau vicepresident of the royals and branch rickey jr head of the brooklyn farm system and that robinson was the first negro ever signed to a contract to play organized baseball several days passed before newsmen discovered that moses fleetwood walker had played major league baseball in the s and that other negroes had played both major and minor league baseball between and the turn of the century branch rickey sr was not present in montreal that day branch rickey jr told newsmen mr racine and my father will undoubtedly be severely criticized in some sections of the united states where racial prejudice is rampant they are not inviting trouble but they wont avoid it if it comes jackie robinson is a fine type of young man intelligent and collegebred and i think he can take it too robinson amazingly well composed said i cant begin to tell you how happy i am that i am the first member of my race in organized ball i realize how much it means to me to my race and to baseball i can only say that ill do my very best to come through in every manner later branch rickey sr spoke about the probable effects of the introduction of a negro to organized baseball it may cost the brooklyn organization a number of ball players rickey said some of them particularly if they come from certain sections of the south will steer away from a club with colored players on its roster some players now with us may even quit but theyll be back after they work a year or two in a cotton mill with those words rickey left no doubt that he had brokencompletely emphatically cleanlywith the authors of baseballs unwritten law against negro players and other bigots in the game he expected strong reactions he was not to be disappointed the bigots of basljall were furious if jackie robinson was a positive symbol to multimillions of american negroes be was a negative symbol to the bigots to those of prejudiced minds jackie robinson represented the premise that negro players would not only come into white basebair and freckle it but also that they would invade the game cn masse and alter its complexion completely and bigots just didnt like that the negro they figured was moving out of liis place one of the alltime greats of baseball history said the admittance of negroes to organized baseball was impractical because of the social aspects involved baseball he said was more than a mere game it was close personal contact living in the same hotels playing cards it was he said a tightlyknit profession a negro he said would not fit into the tightlyknit scheme of things active white major league players hedged most of those interviewed insinuating if not saying outright that they opposed integration dixie walker brooklyns most popular player and a southerner said the signing of robinson was all right with himas long as robinson did not lay on a team with him other white major league players evpressed similar or harsher views there was only one major league player who spoke up in favor of jackie robinson fie was rudy york partindian borne run slugger with the detroit tigers york said he thought the signing of jackie robinson was a grand idea and he wished jackie good luck some of the baseball people who opposed robinson were or tried to be a bit cute in the expression of their opposition clark griffith president of the washington senators said organized baseball should not interfere with organized negro baselall at the time negro baseball teams paid fat rentals for the use of griffith stadium when the senators were out of town one of americas foremost baseball writers professcd great friendship for negroes but said that all too often negroes demanded rights far beyond their capabilities the opposition bombarded w g bramham president of the national association of professional baseball players with letters and telephone calls although bramham s office was located in durham n c calls were received from as far away as california since there was nothing illegal by the letter of written baseball law about tlie admittance of negroes branham was powerless to act against robinson but he could and he did offer a personal opinion father divine ill have to look to his laurels for we can expect rickey temple to be in the course of construction in harlem soon frank shaughnessy president of the international league reportedly feared dire things would happen when robinson played in baltimore however he said there is no rule in baseball that says a negro cant play with a club in organized ball as long as any fellow s tlie right type and can make good and can get along with other players he can play ball many white liberals agreed one of them was a southern white man sportswriter w n cox of the norfolk virginianpilot who told his readers i guarantee that if jackie robinson hits homers and plays a whale of a game for montreal the fans will soon lose sight of his color of course the jackie robinson breakthrough was applauded most rousingly by the negro press negro baseball fans and negro players they all hailed the news with great joy reflecting their fervent desire for acceptance and approval for the actual achie einent of their fullfledged rights as american citizens including the right to play the game called baseball robinson was now a titanic hero to all negroes big and small and middleclass his entry into organized baseball presaged they believed an approaching realization of their dreams of a better life at last what had happened in baseball they believed would soon happen in discriminatory colleges factories churches restaurants negro league players took hope confident that if jackie robinson succeeded they would follow liim into organized baseball every negro kid playing on a rubblestrewn sandlot with hickory stick and lopsided ball now became more serious about the way he swung his bat chased a grounder or slid into the block of stone or wood that represented second base better days were ahead they had to be one of the negro youngsters then playing on a rubblestrewn sandlot grew up to be ed charles kansas city athletics third baseman while in a mood of reminiscence one day in the s charles explained in beautiful words the full meaning of jackie robinsons breakthrough he was our messiah charles said he teas moses to our people he gave us all pride it wasnt just baseball it was everything we had a dream and he made it come true now we could dream about everything it was going to be just like they taught us in school this was a democracy and a man could be what he wanted he only had to be good enough but back in october of there were other dissenters to be heard from tom baird white owner of the negro league kansas city monarchs complained that branch rickey had taken jackie robinson from his club without making any payment whatsoever to him threatening to appeal to baseball commissioner a b happy chandler baird heatedly promised we wont take this lying down baird said robinson signed a contract with us last year and i feel that he is our property if chandler lets montreal get by with this hes really starting a mess baird said robinson had been paid a month also quoted as a month according to jackie a week on being informed of bairds complaint rickey said there is no negro league as such so far as im concerned negro baseball is in the zone of a racket and there is no negro circuit that could be admitted to organized baseball objections such as bairds died a quick natural death within a few days after robinson signed with montreal negro team owners read negro newspapers ascertained that they were talking out of the wrong sides of their mouths and began delivering comments from the right sides in chicago dr j b martin president of the negro american league and frank a fay young league secretary and chicago defender sports editor issued a joint statement vve feel that it the signing of jackie robinson is an elevation of negro baseball they said they were glad the royals had signed jackie during the rickeyrobinson interview of august rickey had asked robinson if he had a girl robinson said he wasnt sure he had been away from home quite a lot no matter he did indeed have a girl her name was rachel isum she was a lovely damsel like robinson she was also from ucla ray bartlett another ucl athlete had introduced them one day when jackie was doing janitorial work in kerckhoflf hall on the ucla campus rachel isum was a nurse a resident of los angeles branch rickey had told jackie robinson that if he had a girl he should marry her before the noble experiment actually began robinson followed rickeys advice he married the girl on february a few weeks later the newlyweds traveled to florida where dodgerowned teams assembled for spring training the wisdom of rickeys suggestion marry the girl was immediately evident just as rickey had predicted just as robinson had known project baseball integration was totally unlike a picnic over the winter the hardcore bigots had honed their antinegro attitudes the curious had sharpened their stares for the spring and americas hopeful negro millions had hitched their wagons to the robinson star plus which there was the matter of actual comietition on the diamond where only robinson alone could make the project work jackie joined the montreal royals in sanford florida where brooklyn had established its general spring training base john wright a negro pitcher was also in camp he had been signed to a brooklyn organization contract during the offseason the negro press was represented at sanford by wendell smith sportswriter and billy rowe of the pittsburgh courier clay hopper a native southerner was the montreal manager racial integration was a new experience for him and initially he was cold to the idea at the time in fact he wasnt even sure that niggers were human beings robinsons teammates represented all sections of the country some of them had been taught racial prejudices before they were taught abcs but not all of the white players were overtly biased against robinson a few of them were pulling for him to succeed some fans were too these fans sympathized with robinson understood the peculiarities of his position wished him well andwith applauseattempted to bolster his spirits during early spring games when he couldnt beg borrow or steal a hit robinsons difficulties at bat were embarrassing to him and to everyone else on his side notliing would have served their purposes better than instant stardom in an attempt to compensate for his failures with the bat robinson began to press in the field throwing the ball hard before his arm was properly conditioned the result a sore arm now he wasnt hitting and he wasnt throwing either sanford authorities added insult to injury they informed brooklyn people that they would not xermit negroes to play with a white team in their town the royals moved from sanford to daytona beach florida and the brooklyn brass shifted robinson from shortstop to second base and he began to encourage them with his ierformances on the field rickeys scouts had said robinsons arm wasnt strong enough for shortstop but it was adequate for second base soon robinson discerned who his friends were on the montreal team johnny jorgensen a third baseman marvin rackley an outfielder al campanis a shortstop and lou rochelli a second baseman warmed u to him although rochelli was himself a promising xlayer and robinson now working out at second base was a competitor rochelli helped robinson master the intricacies of the new position robinson was quick to learn second base play but his hitting was still unimxressive certain observers expressed doubt that he could hit triplea pitching if he couldnt hit triplea pitching surely he couldnt hit major league pitching but one day montreal played an exhibition game with the indianapolis indians of the american association prior to the game indianapolis pitcher paul derringer a former major league cincinnati star told clay hoier that he was going to give jackie robinson a little test twice during the game derringer tcnocked robinson back from home jlate with pitches both times robinson responded with base hits derringer told hopper hell do but the bigots had other ideas montreal went to deland florida to play another exhibition game robinson got a hit and subsequently scored a run sliding across home plate in a cloud of dust as he rose from the ground and began to brush dirt off his uniform a white cop approached him and said get off this here field right now if you dont im putting you in the jail house hopper quickly on the scene spoke to the cop he didnt do anything wrong did he yes he did the cop said what hopier asked we told you to leave them nigra players at home we aint haing nigras and white boys playing on the same field in this town its agin the law and im here to tell you hopper had no ready retort for that he was a deep southerner but now he was embarrassed by the deep south style in racial relations in order to save hopper from the embarrassment of having to tell him to leave the diamond robinson left by way of the dugoiit and wright followed as robinson and wright left however they sensed that hopper was thawing out a little branch rickey had promised jackie robinson tliat the brooklyn organization would go down the line with him robinson had promised to turn the other cheek neither of them aware at the time of the comic line if you turn the other cheek youll get hit with the other fist both of them dead serious about their commitments kept their bargains the brooklyn organization sacrificed several lucrative exhibition dates robinson naturally aggressive bitter and resentful delivered an oscartype performance as opening day approached none of his auditors doubted that he could play second base in triplea ball none of them doubted that he could hit triplea pitching none of them doubted his abilitv to take it the montreal royals opened the international league season at jersey city n j opening day april was sunnybright but chilly robinson was ready for any kind of day the jersey cit giants belonged to the new york giants on opening day each year however they were mayor frank hagues pet project a great fan as well as democratic boss of the city hague used the power of his political ofirce to insure a booming financial seasons beginning for the little giants the opening day crowd in reportedly was a more realistic figure was possibly less but attendance figures werent the no storv on april tlie no story that day was jackie robinson clay hopper set the stage for robinsons ofrcial debut in organized baseball when he walked to home plate and handed his lineup card to an umpire stan bread was montreals leadoff man jackie robinson was to bat second after bread strode to the plate hopper turned to hobinson in the dugoiit and said youre next get on deck robinson arose from his seat went to the batrack selected a bat walked onto the field in pigeontoed strides and kneeled on deck every fan present was now watching jackies every move some of the fans booed when robinson went to bat he was aware of the pressure his forehead was moist but by the time he had run out an easv out to first other fans had begun to cheer thev wanted him to know he had some friends in the stands too robinson went to bat again in the second inning tom tatum and george shuba were on base and montreal was leading by one run again robinson worked the count to threeandtwo on the next pitch he swung hard driving the ball over the leftfield fence feet away in his second time at bat in organized baseball jackie robinson had hit a home run three runs scored shuba was waiting at the plate hand outstretched thats the wav to hit that ball shuba said thats the old ball game right there robinson batted again in the fifth inning bunting safely then he stole second base when the catchers throw eluded the second baseman robinson raced to third base finally the ball was returned to the jersey city pitcher emboldened now robinson took a long lead off third base dancing up and down the base line as robinson took his longest lead the pitcher halted his windup and turned to thirtl base hopper came alive charging toward home plate he cried balk balk the umpire waved robinson home in his box branch rickey grinned the crowd roared with delight robinson batted again in the seventh inning singling for his third consecutive hit then he stole second base again robinson went to bat for the last time that day in the eighth inning singling for his fourth straight hit after the game jersey city fans mobbed robinson once again he said later i was convinced that american sports fans are truly democratic after jackie had dressed rachel robinson rushed to his side you were wonderful today she said i was so thrilled she had every right to be thrilled robinsons firstgame summary read at bats hits home runs singles stolen bases runs scored error the final scoremontreal jersey city was almost incidental as games flew by during the international league season robinson continued to hit with elan and his fielding improved by seasons end he was the leagues best he had hit with the kansas city monarchs with xmontreal he hit leading the league he also led the league in stolen bases with in games rohinson went to bat times hit safely times and scored nins included among his base hits were doubles triples and tliree home runs he drove in runs he led the league again with a fielding average he made only ten enors as he handled putouts and assists montreal won the international league pennant no player on the team was more valuable than jackie robinson no one contributed more to victory but robinsons first season in organized baseball was not all thrills just as rickey had foreseen there were numerous problems to solve fortunately for robinson however the royals were located in a liberal foreign country the people of montreal quickly accepted robinson as a player and as a person when robinson was home in montreal he suffered none of the bnitalities he was forced to endure while playing in his native country in baltimore fans threatened him with bodily harm a syracuse fan tcxk a black cat to the ball park and bellowed hey robinson come meet your brother around the league benchjockeys hurled foul epithets at him but as the season progressed robinson gained the respect and admiration of hopper and his montreal teammates their respect admiration and friendship helped him to survive the aggregate responsibilities of being the first negro to play organized baseball in modern times of carrying the entire negro race on his shoulders of turning the other cheek and never fighting back of holding tight rein on his temper even so robinson almost suffered a ner ous breakdown at an early age nature had begun to mix salt with the pepper of his hair during the baseball season robinson became as gray as an elderly man when the little world series ended bedlam broke out fans swarmed on the field grabbed robinson hopper and pitcher curt davis and paraded them around the diamond in a ictory dance robinson was overwhelmed he cried unashamedly and clay hopper was happy too jackie he said after the series youre a real ball player and a gentleman its been wonderful having you on the team for the moment robinson was completely satisfied robinson spent the offseason in southern california playing a few exhibition baseball games golfing playing professional basketball with a team called the red devils welcoming a son jackie jr visiting family and friends rickey meanwhile was occupied with the numerous details of planning for spring like a theatrical advance man he was thinking ahead scouting every possibility missing no bets early in his preliminary work on this project rickey consulted dr dan w dodson a new york university professor and executive director of mayor laguardias committee on unity in new york city they discussed the sociological aspects of baseball integration rickey consulted various negro leaders took them into his confidence asked for their help assigned them roles in the project in brooklyn negro leaders formed a committee headed by judge myles page and in meetings outlined lectures sermons editorials and pamphlets all designed as behavioral guides for negro fans rickey knew that their overreaction to robinsonsuch as giving him a homerun cheer for a strikeoutcould trigger white backlash adding thereby to robinsons woes in a manner of speaking negro fans were told to he cool herbert t miller a ymca official visited national league cities forming similar committees at the proper time negro sportswriters advised negro fans through their columns and barowners put up signs which said dont spoil jackies chances rickey arranged to hold spring training in cuba where repetition of the sanford and deland incidents were unlikely ehibition trips were planned in venezuela and panama for many years negroes had played baseball in latin america and were popular there there was no way in which rickey could presolve problems involving brooklyn dodger players opposing national league players or white fans he could not send letters to dodger players saying he was going to promote the negro jackie robinson to the parent club and please be nice to him there was no way in which he could reach opposing players he just had to place his trust in the fairness of white sports fansplus perhaps their storied fondness for the underdog brooklyn was a hotbed of baseball and the dodgers were known wherever people understood the game or played it over tlie years the dodgers probably had inspired more hilarious copy than any other team they boasted the games most unique fan tradition everything fans often said happens in brooklyn although it was generally believed that jackie robinson would advance to the brooklyn dodgers in the spring of and although branch rickey had decided to promote him to the parent team at that time robinson was listed on the montreal roster when he went to spring training rickeys plan of course was to handle every detail of the noble experiment in a manner which would stimulate the absolute minimum of adverse reaction robinson reported to spring training camp in fine shape rickey now had to determine the proper time to promote him to the brooklyn teamand what position he would play as a dodger robinson had played second base at montreal but eddie stanky was the brooklym second basemanand although stanky s running fielding and hitting were rated little better than average he was one of the national leagues most valuable players his baseball intelligence and fighting spirit were the answers to that riddle robinson had played shortstop at kansas city but peewee reese was the brooklyn shortstop reese was a fine shortstop and he was still improving in his play moreover robinsons throwing arm had been prejudged as being inadequate for the shortstop position what about third base dodger brass gave it some thought but several third base candidates were in camp and that fact suggested a problem there too among third base candidates were arky vaughan a genuine star cookie lavagetto and robinsons montreal teammate johnny jorgensen onlv first base was left tlie talent was shallow there the question of where robinson would play was answered one day when mel jones montreals general manager handed robinson a first basemans mitt but neither robinson nor hopper was pleased with the decision robinson based his objections to the shift to first on his previous experience and success particularly his secondbase play at montreal it seemed odd to him that he was now being asked to make another switch in positions that his way was being made rougher when so much had been done already in an attempt to help him become a major leaguer when bigotetl dodger players heard that robinson was working out at first base they siinnised that soon he would be promoted to the parent club acting hastily they began to draw a petition against him but before they could complete the petition rickey heard about it stepped in and told the bigots that they could not prevent robinsons promotion robinson himslf decided the proper moment for his promotion during a sevengame series between the royals and dodgers he hit stole seven bases and handled first base chores adequately now the big announcement was scheduled for april but the schedule was disrupted when baseball commissioner a b happy chandler suspended dodgtt manager leo durocher because of his role in a new york yankeebrooklyn dodger squabble oer alleged gambling or the presence of gamblers during a game in havana occupied with this unscheduled incident rickey was forced to delay robinsons promotion but not for long rickey hired burt shotton as durochers replacement and tlie big news broke the next day april montreal and brooklyn were engaged in an exhibition game at ebbets field robinson playing first base for montreal when arthur mann rickeys assistant went to the press box and distributed a simple announcement to baseball wiiters the brooklyn dodgers today purchased the contract of jackie robinson from montreal upon joining the brooklyn dodgcts robinson was issued uniform no on april he played his first major league game at ebbets field the boston braves supplied the opwsition some fans watched the game ihe dodgers won the game to but robinson failed to hit grounding out to third flying out to left and hitting into a double play once he was safe on an error when his bunt was misplayed in a late stage of the game he was removed irom the lineup for defensive reasons in his second major league game on april robinson beat out a bunt for his first major league hit interestingly enough rickeys scouts had rated robinson as an excellent bunter and the first two times he reached base safely as a major were on bunt plays subsequently robinson hit his first major league home run off new york giant pitching in the polo grounds but he fell into a serious slump failing to hit in five straight games fan reaction seemed to fa or robinson scattered booing was heard but most white fans like all negro fans applauded him despite all the tedious planning lectures sermons editorials and barroom signs negro fans cheered every move robinson made from easy outs to home nins some bigots mailed crank letters but there were other letters such as the one which said hope you make it black boy it was signed vvdiite boy opposingteam bench jockeys were rough on robinson when the dodgers opened a home series with the philadelphia phillies bench jockeys greeted robinson with an epithet hey you black nigger ben chapman manager of the phillies was criticized for this rut chapinan a southerner told the press that it the rough jockeying was no worse than the kind of treatment he had received w hen he entered major league baseball the kind of treatment any rookie might receive robinson he claimed was being tieated like any other rookie on the brooklyn team robinson was pretty much a loner clyde sukelorth burt shotteii and george sisler encouraged him stanky helped him solve the intricacies of firstbase play stanky was by the way a southenier like reese who also befriended and helped rolinson robinson and jorgensen were friendly but total acceptance as a fullfledged member of the team did not develop quickly philadelphia and st louis hotels barred robinson most of the time when he was on the road he ate alone or with negro friends he avoided dodger card games he wore as rickey had adv ised the armor of humility the timeworn description of the good negro athlete he is quiet and unassuming but slowly robinson worked his way out of the slump and teammates began to warm up to him just as the royals had done the previous year on may however a big storm broke stanley woodward sports editor of the new york herald tribune reported that a national league players strike instigated by some of the st louis cardinals against the presence in the league of jackie robinson negro first baseman has been averted temtxjrarily and perhaps squashed in recent days woodward continued ford frick president of the national league and sam breadon president of the st louis club liave been conferring with st louis players in the hotel new yorker mr breadon flew east when he heard of the projected strike the story that he came to consult with eddie dyer manager about the lowly stat of the st louis club is fictitious he came on a much more serious errand woodward said the strike though instigated by certain st louis players had actually been suggested by a brooklyn player the plan woodward said had been to strike on may the day of the seasons first brookljiist louis game players woodward said at one stage had coneeived the idca of a general strike within the national league st louis ieople quickly denied that woodwards storv was tnu but a wire serv ice reported that the st louis strikeleaders were marty marion shortstop and terry moore center fielder and woodward quoted fricks flatout warning to strikeminded players there would have been no reason for this warning if there had been no threat of a strike if you do this woodward quoted frick as saying you will be suspended from the league you will find that the friends you think you have in the press box will not support you that you are outcasts i do not care if half the league strikes those who do it will encounter quick retribution all will be suspended and i dont care if it wrecks the national league the national league will go dowm the line with robinson whatevcr the consequences there was no strike by seasons end there was no doubt that robinson was a major kaguer he had stolen bases including three thefts of home to lead the national league he had hit not bad for a rookie a dozen oi his hits were home runs and the dodgers won their first pennant since the first of six they were to win during the decade robinson w as a mmber of the team their world series foe was the new york yankee team a team which seemed for years to have the dodgers hexed the yankees whipped the dodgers again robinson hit several of the yankees who had seen robinson play in spring training had expressed doubt that he would make it in major league baseball during the world sries they expressed amazement ovcr his improvement one of the most significant aspects of the seasonfinancially and in its impact on other club ownerswas the emergence of negro fans in great numbers in just one season robinson proved himself as a serious rival for joe louis until then the races no athletic idol during the season nigro attendance at ebbets field increased per cent in other national league cities the presence of negro fans was even more noticeable when the dodgers played in incinnati negro fans came from as far away as new orleans league statistics revealed that the dodgers attracted fans at home a national league record indeed a phenomenal one for a park which seated less than fans comfortably the dodgers attracted fans to their road games setting another league record and they established singlegame or series attendance records in new york boston pittsburgh and st louis it was conservativdy estimated tliat jackie robinson had boosted league attendance by a halfmillion fans the sporting news baseballs bible named robinson as its rookieoftheselection while announcing the honor editor j g taylor spink said in selecting the outstanding rookie of the sporting ncies sifted and weighed only stark baseball value the sociological experiment that robinson represented the trail blazing that he did the barriers he broke down did not enter into the decision he was rated and examined solely as a frcshman player in the big leagues on the basis of his hitting his running his defensive play his team v alue robinson had earned his honors only those on the team know the great patience and selfcontrol he exercised continuously throughout the season rickey said for this exemplary conduct oft and on the field during the entire season he deserv es the commendation of everyone w hen the temperature soars to a humid degrees in dallas texas and a steamy youth feels like a fight he can rent one for cents the price includes a coach wholl show him the finer points of a left hook a few rounds in the ring will take the steam out of even the most aggressive boy the place is the curtis cokes youth club located in lowerincome south dallas it is named for one of its founders a yearold black man known to sports fans as the wxdterweight boxing champion of the world the club includes young athletes wiio compete in boxing football and track events througbout the us and some other kids ranging in age from seven to the club was born light years ago when cokes and five other men became concemed with the imsupervised and often dangerous play of children in overcrowdfd city parks tlie kids had no guidance and no equipment says cokes we wanted to help prepare them for high school athletics and give them some type of constructive recreation so with kids eager to play football and not a helmet or shoulder pad among them cokes and his group began to build a program that was soon to prove its worth last year the track team placed third in the national junior olympics in washington d c one member is a champion high school discus thrower at least one boxer is planning to turn pro and a graduate of the pcewce football team is with the kansas city chiefs t he club offers much more tlian just sports if the kids need entertainment its here says executive director cokes we try to take lip their spare time we keep them so busy they just dont have any toward this end the walls of the buildinji are lined with punching bags weights and exercise machines for the less active there is a pool table pinball machines and a juke box tliere is strong emphasis on the importance of education schoolage youngsters must be attending school and they have to maintain a c average to stay in good standing at the club when a youngsters grades fall below c he is put on probation until he brings them back up the club is integrated in both race and sex its membership is about per cent white with some latin americans as well seventyfive to girls belong they have their own track team and attend karate classes a favorite witli most we wouldnt run this club for just one race says cokes its for the kids no matter what color they are in a sporting event a negro s just another athlete thats the way it should be in everything i think we have a smooth operating club he adds weve nver had a single racial incident the coaching staff is also multiracial it numbers several negro white and latin coaches and teachers from dallas junior and senior high schools they like the directors and officers receive no pay and most of them points out cecil o jordan the clubs president are the original coaches who first volunteered their time in cokes brother earnest a pro boxer is a fulltime iartner he really runs tlie gin says cokes brothers donald and joe also boxers help out when they can it takes to operate the club for one year and expenses are growing with plans lo add basketball and softball sonkxlav and perhaps swimming money is a problem so far most of it has come from cokes hip pocket but the champ wont be champ forever and outside help will become necessary membership dues of a year provide a little money but if a kid cant come up with tire fee he can join for cents a small rent is charged on boxing equipment and civic groups sometimes make donations but the money is quickly spent on needed equipment and food for the teams when they are on trips tliis year for the first time the club is planning fundraising events such as boxing exhibitions and is having to solicit donations from dallas organizations cokes dreams of someday being able to employ fulltime paid help so people can earn a living helping the kids instead of volunteering spare time from regular jobs that dream he admits is a long way from reality from a decorators standpoint the club isnt much to look at just one mammoth room with equipment that bears testimony to the energy with which it is used a big fan stirs the air thick air with the sweat of physical activity but tliats not how the kids see it as one youngster idanting after a struggle with the weights put it this is my favorite place i wish i lived here a t ten months old david josepli kiiii has already seen his share of

march but even though he had not been born in a hospital doctors pronounced him normal and healthy officer leopolia west who appears to be a quiet gentle man explains simply why he wants joey when i saw this little baby he recalls no one was really paying much attention to it i guess it was just compassion i felt just the fact that the baby was abandoned and the nurses saw i liked the baby so they let me hold and feed it tlien i decided that i would like to keep it and become its father even though im not married i wanted to adopt it he applied to juvenile court for temporary custody of the child with s t l his neighbor mrs clayton robinson who agreed to take care of the baby temporarily until west could employ a housekeeper she says i really didnt know mr west that well but when he asked me to take temporary custody of joey i thought it was touchingthat a man could love a baby that much so although have four children of my own i thought welli can do that much for a helpless child the robinsons had to give up the baby when det robinson died now west is still fighting to obtain custody of joey and to start adoption proceedings says mrs robinson if he truly wants joey i

adopting this childthats well and good but what we should be really saying is good luck to joey w hen men and women play at childrens games almost anything is hkely to happenand in the olympiad in mexico city almost anything or should we say almost everything did in the rarified atmosphere of mexico city feet above sea level sprinters were supposed to be able to run just a wee bit faster and distance men were sujposcd to fall on their faces at the end of a race from lack of oxygen actually it turned out that sprinters were able to run a wee bit fasterbut distance runners stayed upright long jumpers weight lifters gymnasts swimmers divers rifle marksmen volleyball teams basketball players etc seemed to have found the thin air to their liking in one of the most amazing olympics in the history of the games world records were broken or tied times olympic records were almost average performance as they were exceeded some times sometimes in several heats and then in the final of a single event a troe world n most of the olympic events particularly in track and field and in swimming which are not contested professionally the gold medal winner can claim without any fear of contradiction that he or she is the best in the world that is why young men and women make almost any sacrifice in order to compete tliey know that once they win the words he was an olympic gold medal winner in will be a part of his biography right up until his obituary the lure of olympic gold is so strong to the individual performer that harry edwards attempt to organize a black athletes boycott of the games was almost doomed to failure from its inception because the olympics are held at fouryear intervals most athletes will have the opportunity to compete only once in a lifetime and few contestants either black or white will voluntarily pass up that opportunity the greatest olympics ever o n the strength of the perfonnance of the thousands of athletes gathered in mexico city the olympics must go down in the books as the greatest olympics ever the prying eye of television showed the world such fantastic events as young bob beamon breaking the worlds long jump record by more than two feet as he leaped feet inches a washed up wyomia tyus winning two gold medals and setting a new world record in the meter dash for women an unorthodox higli jumper dick fosbury springing to victory by going over the bar backwards and a green rookie heavyweight boxer george foreman pounding far more experienced ringmen into submission as he earned his gold medal black american trackmen dominated the running events and white american swimmers took charge of the pool when it was all over the us athletes had amassed gold silver and bronze medals for a total of the most ever won by america but what will be remembered ut out of the total olympics the one thing which will be most remembered by all had nothing to do with athletic performance it had to do with black protest and it had to do with the petty action by the us olympic committee following the protest among the black athletes on the us team sprinters tommie smith and john carlos two trackmen from san jose state where prof harry edwards started his boycott attempt were without a doubt the most mihtant of olympic competitors on the track smith had performed like a superman pulling a groin muscle while winning his semifinal heat of the meter dash he seemed an impossible starter for the finals scheduled for just two hours later he not only started he won the event in world record time seconds carlos took third what took place next will be long remembered the black athletes had been promising a strong demonstration and it came when opposite page smith c and carlos accepted their medals and turned to face the american flag for the playing of the national anthem standing motionless and looking down toward the ground the athletes each raised a clenched blackgloved fist in a black_power salute in retrospect the protest was strong but not unreasonable black athletes had first threatened total boycott and then had hinted about such things as refusing to take the stand to accept medals but they had competed and they had taken the stand they did not wear black armbands as had once been suggested all accepted their medals and only smith and carlos made any formal protest with their bowed heads and lifted fists they were saying that they were black americans who had performed to the best of their ability and that they protested the way their black brothers have been treated in the very country they represented in a nation where black protest has reached such heights as ghetto riots school boycotts and impassioned requests for a separate state the smithcarlos demonstration should look like childs play in a nation where white vietnam war protesters have flaunted viet cong flags burned and tom american flags and burned draft cards the smithcarlos demonstration appeared as solemn as a church sendee crime and punishment ut the u s olympic committee felt they could not stand idly by the next day both smith and carlos were suspended from the olympic team an empty gesture for they had no more events in which to compete and they were banished from the olympic village usoc ofiicials used the excuse that the international olympic committee had threatened to kick out the entire us team if strong punishment were not forthcoming no one believed this since there had not even been a request for smith and carlos to turn in their own medals and the games went on with militant lee evans taking first in the meter dash next day and accepting his medal in stoic silence irresponsible rumors lack athletes performed admirably in track and field gold silver and bronze medals went to black runners and jumpers with never a public word of thanks from the powers that be instead came ugly rumors that several of the black athletes would be disqualified for professionalism because they had reportedly accepted money from equipment manufacturersparticularly track shoes there were reports that there would be an investigation to clear up the accusations before the end of the games but the us officials who seemed bent on tarnishing the names of black athletes apparently opened a pandoras box with tlieir rash statements it seems that there is a serious problem of olympic athletes accepting money from manufacturers but its not a case of black americansit includes practically every country that competes in the games dan ferris secretary emeritus of the us amateur athletic union revealed that the scandal was worldwide in scope and international olympics committee president avery bnmdage said that his committee would not act until one of the national committees brought the matter to his committees attention no one seems anxious to do this now and it seems the investigation will be a long time coming look back in honesty hat socalled amateur athletes have received money over and above expenses in the past is known to almost everyone connected with sports that socalled amateur athletes will receive money over and above expenses in the future is an accepted fact what needs to be done now is for the various amateur athletic bodies to get together and put a realistic definition on amateurism and then they must make sure that black amateurs are treated as fairly as white amateurs if this is done then the olympics might be contested with no demonstrations of any kind i ieusi wapendezr is tlie swahili vcr sion of black is beatitifnl tlu two sentences ihysically resemble each other only in their use of roman script otherwise they are as dissimilar as swahili and english yet swahili has much to do with the familiar declaration of pride in blackness that is swelling crescendolike across the land for an increasing number of heritageconseions blacks are claiming that the study of swahili is a window to african culture a revelation that standards of linguistic excellence did not occur only in europe a way for identitv depriv ed american blacks to find their cultural roots one of the foremost proponents of this point of view is bald bearded ron karenga a doctoral candidate in african studies at the university of california at los angeles ucl and head of the us cultural organization in los angeles which rose phocnixlike out of the ashs of watts as fluent in swahili as lie is in soul karenga is hip to the massive influence of language on thinking since the minds of black folks must undergo the most profound revolution the most thorough debrainwashing he believes the study of swahili is therefore crucial karenga contends the very choice of the language one speaks like incidentallv the choice of an afrohairstvle african dress or african name is an act of selfdetermination and selfdefinition thus for example it vvoidd probably nev er occur in a language produced by black people that the word black is made synonymous with blot dingy threatening wicked foul ete as is the case in english karenga explains his us organization choose swahili over perhaps or more other african languages because it is not connected with any one tribe indeed there is no such thing as a swahili tribe since most american blacks have no knowledge of their ancestral tribe anway karenga argues that a study of swahili will give them an emotional and intellectual identification with that wellspring of blackness which is the entire african continent now karenga is a black man who has never visited africa another scholar dr lyndon harries is an exchurch of england missionary who spent more than years in tanzania and kenya and today heads the university of wisconsins african languages and literature department both agree on the beauty precision and importance of swahili but after that their views diverge with scholarly detachment harries points out that swahili was the language of the slaveraiders of east africa in the th century thus casting doubt on swahili as a legitimate source of black pride if the black communitv in the united states wishes to find an african language which represents best what has been most consistently the vehicle of africas aspirations and africas resistanceainst foreign domination the professor continues swahili must come verv low on the list the reasons for its choice at least the political reasons are at complete variance with the historical facts about the language the swahili expert questions whether in order to be proud of their african heritage american blacks need to speak an african language at all there are some educated africans especially in sierra leone who do not speak any african language and yet do not feel themselves deprived in the least he argues then harries counters his owm objection by admitting black americans answer this argument by stating rightly enough that these educated africans are fullv integrated into their society but they themselves are not harries insists the study of swahili is its own justification and need not be linked up with the black awareness movement he wants to tell black people what they should and should not do he argues no white man can do that but presumably a black man can it happens that another distinguished africanist dr lorenzo turner of chicagos roosevelt university reaches conclusions quite like those of dr harries only their starting points are different a student of african culture for more than years the black scholar is pleased by the current upsurge of interest in africa nevertheless dr turner is also dubious about swaliili as the proper vehicle of that interest as he explains so far as the connection between the new world negroesnot just the american negroesand swahili is concerned it has no place at all american blacks have picked swahili because tliey just didnt know that most of the new worlds slaves came from hausa and yonibaspeaking areas swahili was not tied in w ith their african culture both yoriiba and hausa are widely spoken in brazil which received three times as many slaves as did the united states there are probably more yonibaspeaking people in the new world than any other african group in fact only an estimated swahili linguists excluding african students live in the united states their very scarcity contributed to a major curriculum revolution earlier this year at taft junior high school in bronx n y the onethird black school offered classes in spanish french german and hebrew last year but no courses especially catering to students of african heritage meanwhile tliere was a growing black awareness in the school sparked by yearold senior leonard d champs and other leaders in the afroamerican culture society the drisnkiwearing teenager had been a core member for four and a half years and it was excore director floyd mckissick who had written a guest column in the new york times last december interpreting the mood of the black community and singling out african language courses as a means of fostering black pride mckissick stressed swahili in particular because he had just returned from the swahilispeaking nations of east africa leonard d champs helped transform mckissicks ideas into action he recalls since a large part of the population of the world is african and since the school was offering courses in the languages of students of other cultural backgroundsin brooklyn there are even courses in norwegianthe black students felt that they should have the opportunity to study an african language since africa is our mother home european languages and european culture had been offered to us all our liveswe wanted something we could identify with in february leonard and the principal at that time c edwin linville held a press conference to announce the new course in swahili that was on a fridav linville recalls on saturday the new york times ran a very irate editorial attacking the project as totally irrelevant to negro people they meant that black kids who could barely speak english should not waste time on a primitive jungle language like that the presumptuous editorial set off a chain reaction of comments and linville received clippings letters and inquiries from supporters and opponents from across the country he even receied a clipping from a kenya paper congratulating taft junior high on its new venture meanw hile a white backlash had surfaced on the faculty the teachers saw it as a sign of black extremism taking over leonard recalls today swahili tomorrow the revolution or something later in a scholarly journal article dr lyndon harries doubted that the introduction of an african language into secondary school courses would do much to combat as some have suggested the dangerous belief that africa is inferior to the west in many respects it is a plain fact that africa is inferior to the west for example in technology in higher education in many fields but in the gift of speech the african continent is exceptionally wcllendowed many of these languages are being studied in depth in at least american universities some high schools in chicago los angeles rankin pa newark and philadelphia and niimcroiis blackawareness centers around the country howard university offers african languages while are listed at ucla which has produced the largest number of phds and mas in african studies but among students of africa swahili is easily the most popular language their numbers at ucla the university of wisconsin and howard university to name a few schools has increased more than per cent since last year proponents for the study of swahili say it is the easiest african language to learn because it is nontonal that is unlike chinese and other tonal languages swahili does not depend on variations in tone to distinguish words of different meaning that otherwise would sound alike swahili is also easier say its supporters because it is more accessible to american students than other african languages that is it is more widely translated uses homan script unlike for example arabic and offers the greatest number of trained people to teach it swahili reports one scholar has a length of tradition and flexibility of vocabulary that make it as serviceable and sophisticated as practically any language in the world it is older than english old english dates from ad having been formed in tlie second and third centuries ad when the bantuspeakers of the great eastvvard migration on tile continent settled on the east african coast the language dev eloped as a blend of the bantu and arabic languages and it is estimated that about per cent of the words in swahili today are of arabic origin in fact the word swahili itself comes from the arabic sawahil meaning of the coast and the swahili title of mualimu meaning teacher for tanzanias president julius nyerere is of arabic origin but swahili has also borrowed from german persian hindi gujurati portuguese and other languages the english bicycle becomes baisekeu hospital translates hospitali and a car becomes motokoa teenager is written tineur and a mbenzi is a suave dude who rides around in a mercedesbenz english in turn has borrowed from swahili especially s fltnwhich means journey not hunting trip and bwana which means mister more than boss the ability of swahili to integrate with foreign ideas and terminologies makes it one of the worlds great hy brid languages third only to arabic and hausa among the most widely spoken african languages it is the mother tongue of more than million people in east and central africa and the official language of tanzania in kenya the ruling party once held its coufertnces in english hut now conducts them in swahili despite the claims of some sw aliili scholars however the language has proved difficult to students already conditioned to speak english the swahili v erhforms cannot he easily fitted into the usual categories of indoeuropean verbforms especially in the matter of tenses admits one scholar a translation of a swahili verb form is always an approximation the swahili speaker does not seem to associate a fixed timereference with isolated verbforms instead he manipidates them quite freely in his chosen frame of reference in such a wav that present past or future events can equally he represented as transpiring at the moment of speaking also many swahili sentences have no verb at all according to dr harries afroamericans use sentences of this type he explains a young afroamerican may say to his girl friend you my chick baby in swahili the corresponding sentence would go similarly swahili deals with some subjects vvilh an exhaustiveness unknown in english there are a dozen words for example to describe coconuts and their growth untranslatable into english sexual intercourse can he described as either kuughv kuhvmbwa or kitiniliana all depeudiug on whether the act is considered from the v iewpoint of the man the woman or the couple aersatility aside perhaps the most difficult aspect of swahili for englishspeaking students are the profound differences in the philosophical orientation underlying both languages thus for example swahili has no word to express the english have it has no substitutes corresponding exactly to the english possessives instead it uses constructions which indicate a special relation between a thing and a person these grammatical differences arise out of basic differences betsveen the western and the bantu mentality regarding property ownership an american for example sees property possession as an extension of his rights to a part of the material world he is not dutybound to share his possessions with others no matter how needy they may be for the bantu on the other hand possession means no more than a temporary association with the things possessed possessions are at his disposal for his sustenance and support as a member of a clan and ultimately for the welfare of the tribe unlike the american the bantu thinks of the clan and the tribe as more imortant than the individual the greatest evil that can befall him is for him to be totally separated from his family from his clan from his ancestors a man cut off from his family and tribe is considered to be nothing and therefore destroyed forever although this concept of iossession has been modified somewhat by bantu contacts with europeans basically it has persisted and still reflects in bantu customs the bantu helps his neighbor when he is working the land and preparing it for the sowing of his seed he helps his neighbor to collect the harv est he helps him build his house and for no other payment than a drink of native beer when the work is done bantus share their joys and their sorrows they attend the burial of a neiglibor they share food and drink salary and even punishment again the life of a bantu is subordinate to the life of the tribe and his possessions are primarily possessions of the clan in short a swahili worldview is quite different from that emanating from say the vatican in rome or a storefront church in harlem but this alone docs not make the language harder to teach than european tongues explains dr harries ive found some afroamericans who attended my class at the university of wisconsin who expected swahili to be easier than it is he recalls some of these are disadvantaged in many was before they ever start on swahili some of them need instruction on basic principles of grammatical behavior swahili as compared witli other african languages has a wealth of literature it was a literary language for many centuries previous to the coming of the europeansfirst of the portuguese in the th century and then of the english and germans in the th century the language is rich in proverbs including such famihar sounding maxims as one of the truly magnificent traits of swahilispeaking people is that so many are interested in poetry and still follow the traditional fonn many politicians write poetry president nyerere translated julius caesar into swahili amri abedi who was mayor of dar es salaam and later a member of the cabinet was a wellknown poet in fact he wrote a book in swahili called how to compose a swahili poem swahili newspapers abound with the poetic contributions of just ordinary swahilispeaking citizens out of this rich literary tradition has come an epic poem the story of liyongo the hero like samson of the bible or achilles of ancient greek literature has superluiman powers that strike fear in the liearts of his enemies he is almost invincible eccpt for one small flaw samsons destruction could only be caused by the cutting of his hair achilles heel had to be pierced by an arrow before he would die liyongos death could only be caused by a copper dagger these three superhiimans reflect mans universal desire to give himself heroes who are almost invincible who are almost like gods who embody all the ideals he was taught and consequently feels he must attain men create their heroes and dieir languages in their own image but black heroes comparable to liyongo arc blackballed whiteballed depending on point of view in western mythology he had to be born of mother africa champions of swahili would say the story of liyongo does not exhaust the richness of the language all of which is another way of saying wcusi wapemlcza mpenzi wangu black is beautiful baby think hes a jood football player mrs i orcnthal janies simpson says of her husband blit i dont think he is superman lea e it to a wife to cut a man dow n everybody else thinks o j simpson is superman and when the dazzling university of southern california halfback scored one of his three touchdowns against stanford last october by flying through the air a los angeles sportswriter dwight chapin came hat out and said so it was right after the pitchers duel known as the i world series that chapin wrote bob gibson isnt superman neither is mickev lolich and neitherface itis clark kent superman is orenthal james simpson but one does not ha e to take the word of an armchair quarterback to arrive at the conclusion that there is something supernatural about o j sk anybody who has ever had to play against him ask for instance stanford linebacker don parish who before his teams meeting with usc had rashly predicted simpson would be held to yards we contained him for a half said parish after the game but then we got tired and he got stronger the whole storv of that encounter is this ten seconds lief ore the opening kickolf it was annoiiuced that it was very doubtfur that o j simpson would even be able to play the game because of a bruised thigh twisted knee and pulled muscleany one of which could sideline an ordinary mortal thus handicapped poor bruised twisted and strained o j was only able to carry the ball times during the game run for yards set up a touchdown ith a yard pass and score three times himself including once on a fyard sprint in which he outran almost the entire stanford team thus the question looms on a day when o j simpson is healthy should the pregame ceremonies include a soprano singing the star spanfled banner or a priest administering the last rites to the opposing team in the first four games this year simpson gained yards from scrimmage and scored touchdowns a projection of this fantastic performance coupled with last years total of lo yarils gained and touchdowns indicates that o j in only two years of varsity football he spent two years at city college of san francisco before joining lsc may break every existing college individual rushing record hild by anylody who e er played three seasons d azzlkd loyearokls and turnedon middlcajed matrons the wives of local professors perhaps assaulted the ears of purdue football players as they filed out of the dressing room in twos and threes after wasting the iowa llawkeyes to wheres leroy did he leave out of another door is leroy coming out waiting an hour and or so minutes for a schoolboy halfback to emerge from a dressing room is an absurd ritual that repeats itself any saturday afternoon that leroy keyes goes into his act in rossade stadium on the lafayette ind campus his stage measures by yards and his actwhich in its versatility makes him the sammv davis jr of college footballis very very tough finally like nobility on the heels of commoners leroy keyes alone happened through the door a slight limp all but obscured by the spring in his step he had suffered a knee injury the week before an ap reporter up in the press box had speculated that he probably wouldnt see much action on this homecoming afternoon but keyes played about threefourths of the game picked up yards the wav vou plaved today your knee must not be hurting anymore said a lady worshipper to the man who looks even taller under a football helmet she hadnt noticed that her hero while twic reaching pay dirt and setting a new purdue career scoring record of points had depended more on sheer power and speed than the exciting cutting one anticipates in his running as he obliged autograph addicts keyes insisted that the knee had been hurting all afternoon and remarked a mite perhaps the best measure of a mans ability is how much his enemies are willing to concede that he has o j only gained yards and scored once against the university of texas in the second arsity game of his career but texas coach darrell royal said afterwards i hope we dont see anybody this season with more capabilities than o j simpson and i dont think we will against indiana in the rose bowl that same year simpson gained yards and scored twice and indiana coach john pont replayed it later we had men climbing all over him all aftenioon hell gain yards you just cant stop that the problem with defending o j simpson is pretty much like that of trapping a grizzly bear with a twoday toothache once you have caught him what do you do with him o j is six feet two inches tall and he weighs about pounds and he can nm x yards in seconds so much for size and speed o j also has power in one game this season with use needing four yards for a td o j looked for a hole in the line and instead ran into five tacklers he picked up two yards on the next play simpson looked for the hole again and found five more tacklers he scored the touchdown classically you gotta play on gut sometime several minutes later keyes agreed to a meeting at the student health center where he was to report sunday morning to have the knee treated it turned out to be his tuni to waitthe trainer arrived sometime after the appointed hourand he waited patiently talking about how many foxes were at the homecoming ball and how hard they had partied with much greater enthusiasm than he discussed the trade that has brought him the fame he wears so casually an inquiry about his knee drew a rapidfire response no its not so bad itll be okay next week everythings gonna be lovely baby as his knee bathed in the whirlpool runnerup for the heisman tmphy last year o j led the nation in yards nishing with yards by the end of this season simpson might well have eclipsed the tlireeyear individual rushing record witliin only two seasons perhaps the best measure of a mans ability is how much his enemies are willing to concede that he has o j only gained yards and scored once against the university of texas in the second arsity game of his career but texas coach darrell royal said afterwards i hope we dont see anybody this season with more capabilities than o j simpson and i dont think we will against indiana in the rose bowl that same year simpson gained yards and scored twice and indiana coach john pont replayed it later we had men climbing all over him all aftenioon hell gain yards you just cant stop that the problem with defending o j simpson is pretty much like that of trapping a grizzly bear with a twoday

one game this season with use needing four yards for a td o j looked for a hole in the line and instead ran into five tacklers he picked up two yards on the next play simpson looked for the hole again and found five more tacklers he scored the touchdown o j simpson continued keyes turned his attention to the sports section of the sunday newspaper especially noting the scores of other big ten conference games played the previous day he commented on purdues remote chances of making it to the rose bowlchances all but ruined by way of a upset at the hands of ohio statebut impressed one as having come to terms with the improbability rose bowl or no the young man from newport news va will leave behind him at purdue a record nothing less than spectacular as a sophomore keyes was primarily a defensive back and folks with good memories swear that had he never once carried the ball from the top of the boilermakers iformation or lined up at right flanker he would nevertheless have become an allamerica choice but for the past two seasons he has been running from the i throwing passes from the i catching passes as a flanker and when the opposition gets too nasty playing defense keyes has been taking care of all that business with so mucji stvle this vear that fans arent to be blamed if theyve forgotten that last year he also used to kickoff as well as run back kickoffs and punts i yes leroy does everything when purdue coach jack mollenkopf was sidelined with hepatitis a few days after the iowa game one had to be forgiven for wondering if last year keyes led the nation in scoring so much for size speed and power o j has durability let northwestern coach alex agase tell you about that the thing that really gets me says agase is that he carries the ball or times a game when you count his runs from scrimmage his pass receptions and his kickoff returns it takes great pursuit to tackle him so he gets hit two three four or five times every time he carries the ball that means he gets hit between and times a game his durability is unbelievable such abilityand such recognition of that abilityis enough to swell the head of a sophisticated person let alone a young boy from san franciscos povertyridden hunters point but again o j does not appear to be quite mortal the oncetough youngster i loved to fight we used to crash parties and pick a fight for nothing is a model of deportment a bininiis student a dedicated husband and an interviewers dream he answers quickly honestly articulately he is smart enough to know that professional football is going to make him a wealthy man and humble enough to want to dedicate a portion of all the remaining years of his life to helping kids from the same sort of underprivileged background as his i feel that its material things that count o j says of trying to impress youngsters i know there are a lot of people with names and nothing to show for it who if they went back to my old neighborhood in hunters point or potrero hill in san franciset the guvs would listen to them but they would forget it all the next day but if you come up there and say look what ive got ive got a nice home i dont have to won about anytliing ive got money thats it theyre gonna listen when you dont have anything you want material things i think thats what pro football and a few other things will do for me it will give me time and money to go back and talk to the kids the way i want to i want to do some of it while im playing pro ball but want to go into more in the years after that o j says he has not seen a youth program vet that is as effective as he thinks it should be and that he with the help of others may start something new meanwhile to accomplish his dream o j has to play football and a man who singlehandedly gains more yardage than some entire teams has to face the question of whether he might burn himself out the only wav a runner can burn himself out is to get punchy o declares i try not to give the guys too many real good shots at me ive been getting hit more this vcar because i hav ent been work ing out and it gets my timing off injuries kept o j out of practice much of the time early this season but at game time there he was waiting to eat the enemv alive with points on touchdovvns his touchdowns for points against big ten opposition was good enough to break a conference record that had held up since l he averaged a remarkable yards per carry while leading the big ten in rushing with yards they might hold him to less than yards this seasonif they pass a law against the use of contact lenses other purdue records that have yielded to leroy are most yards rushing in one game against illinois and most yards by pass reception in a game against northwestern you wont in this country in these times come much closer to consensus than minnesota coach murray warmaths exclamation hes hes hes hes absolutely fantastic ive never seen another like him after his date with the w hirlpool keyes took the wheel of his mustang and headed for his dormitory vv here awaited a v ery special guest m iss gladvs mcdaniel who confides that her attiaction to football is not nearlv so intense as her attraction to the football player she has been going with since they were freshman classmates at norfolks carver high where leroy starred in football basketball baseball and track relaxing in his room keyes was anything but given to classic remarks as he discussed the role of the black athlete in racist america and the concomitant role of the black student on a white campus purdues near enrollment includes a minute number of blacks about it was about half as manv last year as now noted ke es the school vv hich boasts more students enrolled in science courses than at anv other single institution in the country was no exception to the phenomenon that last vear rocked and in some wavs awakened white college campuses the black students as they like to say it got themselves together it wasnt publicized much said keyes proudly but last spring we had a demonstration that really shook this place up one sunday all of the black students dressed smartly we got tied down baby and marched to the schools administration building each of them the girls included carrying a brick in his hand they didnt know what we were gonna do they were upset man what are you gonna do are you gonna start a riot are vou gonna burn down the campus or something we just coolly piled the bricks in front of the building left a list of demands put up a sign and marched back to our dormitories the sign they put up read the fire next tlme among their demands was the demand for more scholarships including other than athletic rides for black students when i first o js coach john nfckay explained the situation this way during one of o j s doubtful play periods if he comes out to practice today and the trainer says he cant play he wont play if he cant play all week he wont play all week but if he comes to me about a quarter to eight saturday night and says im ready you can bet hell be in there i guess id just figure he was better than the guy who practiced all week injured or not out of practice or not o j simpson is just not one of those things to look forward to it you are an opposing football player generally i try to take it to the guy simpson explains of his hostile actions toward wouldbetacklers instead of letting him hit me ill hit him first if i know im going to get hit i try to bring tlie force on him i dont tliink i get hit hard enough or often enough to being punchy or burning myself out i like carrying the ball a lot the use trojans ha e a very simle reason for giving the ball to o j as often as they do and now everybody knows what it is if you give the ball to o j frequently enough sooner or later hes going to explode and score he has paul hornungs instinct for the goal line says professional football player jon arnett who has this further bit of bad news for the pro players who will in future years have to try to contain simpson i think o j is a smaller jimmy brown he doesnt make the big gains like gale sayers just the short punishing gains one thing simpson has over both sayers and brown is speed hes much faster than either oftimes o j makes those short punishing gains as a matter of prudence explains o j in junior college when i got the ball my whole concept was touchdomi ive had to change my way of thinking here i carry the ball so much you cant think touchdown youve got to think of the situation if yon need five yards you think of getting five yards or maybe a little more instead of chancing it and maybe going all the way or maybe not getting any yards the worse thing that a back can ever feeland ive felt it a number of timesis that if the opportunity presented itself to go all the way he is too tired to do it thats the worse feeling in the world and thats why you work out hard during the week to the casual game observer o j may appear to be on the brink of exhaustion long before the final whistle his speed is often deceptive anyvay his long strides do not necessarily give him the appearance of a streak of lightning in the manner of the great buddy young who took short quick steps nd when hit o j does not try to give anybody the impression he is made of either rubber or steel by bouncing immediately upright he is slow coming off the ground and even slower getting back to the huddle all of this is by design of course and one team made an got here recalled keyes there were very very few blades other tlian athletes this year there are more black girls on campus than in the past yeah they didnt want joe sam jumping on sally nn so they went out and recruited some soul sisters laughed leroy keyes is a bona fide example of todays conscientious black athlete secure in the alue of his talent and not duped into believing that manhood is so simple as crossing a goal line he recognized the personal sacrifice involved in the action taken by track stars tommie smith and john carlos in the olympics and applauded their courage alter smith and carlos stuck their necks out the way they did i think all the blacks in the olympics should have supported them in the wake of much publicity about the abuse of black athletes often by coaching staffs in both the college and pro ranks keyes is frequently asked if he is happy with the treatment received at purdue he is relatively comfortable he says but assures one that the black football players at purdue will not as it were dance at any brideless weddings they number the starting backfield excepting quarterback is black and the same with the second string backfield we stick together said keyes and he speaks of a couple of occasions when theyve had to set a white teammate straight weve had to go to the coach about a matter or two but hes always been straight with us me and jack are tight we talk all the time says keyes coach mollenkopf is to be excused for having virtually functioned in the nations sports pages these past two years as keyes press agtnt nobody after all has profited more from north carolina a ts loss i was all set to go to a t a black college in greensboro n c when i changed my mind and accepted the scholarship to purdue keyes recalls well i wanted to play football and i knew id play at a t you know how it is playing at a black high school in the south you might gain yards but a white boy who runs for yards gets all the publicity keyes isnt surprised by his success at purdue howe er reflecting upon the way he felt at the start of his jouniey to glor his usually even voice gave vent to the emotions of a man visiting an old and furious rage when i got here i knew that some chuck who made allstate allworld alleverything had his position made i knew td have to be twice as good having filled that order the time has come for leroy keyes to call some shots as a player exbaltimore colt star lennie moore was his modeland the similarities in their styles are many but as a man who in the coming months must bargain with a professional football club owner he has found for himself a model tailormade for the occasion he tells this storv when mel farr went to the bargaining table with the detroit lions he said want three things first i want to gain yards the owners said that sounded fine second want to inordinate display of courtesy by helping o j to his feet after each crunching tackle hovcer there was a deviousness to all the amenity they simply wanted to make sure o j didnt get any rest between plays when o jwhich has been translated into the nickname orange juicehas had his rest he is something else he may race anywhere from to yards from scrimmage as ucl which saw him gallop yards to sew up the national championship for use and washington against which o j ran an yard draw play well know in junior college where he was acclaimed the most sensational football player of all time he had touchdown nins of and yards o js uncanny running ability has been attributed to several factors one his exceptional peripheral vision which enables him to see things happening near his sides as well as straight ahead he also tends to follow his blockers as much as possible and can recall which man made which move after a play he also has good faking moves and uses them with economy he can shift quickly swing into high gear suddenly slant off his opponents with power andfinallyfly already a cinch for fourtime allmerican including junior college allamerica nominations o j simpson this year figures now to be a prohibitive favorite for the coveted heisman trophy as college football player of the year an honor for which he was runnerup last year this time if he does not get it the resulting demonstration is likely to make the battle at the selma bridge look like a lovein make rookie of the year they really liked that said it was great and third i want a million dollars the owners didnt say anything about that laughed keyes but the bargaining began a specialist even a leroy keyes must become in the pros and its anyones guess what position hell play and no doubt is entirely dependent upon the needs of the team that lands him i really dont care he says at first but when pinned down confesses an inclination towards flanker when purdue and notre dame met this season in a game billed as the poll bowl in which the oddsmakers oddly enough made the fighting irish favorites keyes in leading purdue to a victory proved to be the specialist who could plug the tub of another specialist not only did leroy throw a touchdown pass run for two more and catch passes but notre dames great passcatching end jim seymour did not while leroy was gracing the defensive secondary catch a single jtass purdue end bob dillingham caught passes for yards in that game but the phipps to dillingham success of that particular afternoon had as much to do with a decoy named keyes as it had to do with quarterback phipps right arm asked what he was doing on those plays when he operated from his flanker slot as a decoy keyes answered nothing nothing at all i just did nothing on those plays through a fairly good pair of binoculars however he was more than once sighted as the play went to dillingham on the opposite side of the field doing nothing all rightnothing less than giving two or three defenders pounds of hell well smiled keyes sometimes the cats get to slapping me and you know i have to slap them back quick confident and nottobeslappcd leroy keyes has made a stonestrong bid for the heisman trophy the annual prize that goes to the college football player judged to be the best in the country the only way the sportswriters who do the voting cim make up for the bag they came out of a year ago is to split the trophy between two guys tliis year if they dont do that and leroy doesnt get it hell probably be hip enough to say run on o j witli your bad

for the holidayl i n the old days he used to ride up and down superior avenue in cleveland in his teddy bearcolored cadillac convertible and girls would turn around excitedly and say oooooh there goes jim brown he never picked them up of course because that would have been bad he was jim brown fullback in those days and coach paul brom didnt like his players fooling around besides sue his wife was at home in their little white house in the mt pleasant neighborhood and her friends phoned her enough already calling themselves reporting on jim telling her the tilings they saw him do and those they just thought he probably would besides jim was always cool with his stuff dont be seen riding down superior avenue with a chick have her meet you say up near western reserve university in the howard johnson motel but now jim was sitting in a deck chair on the red tile terrace of the aquadulce hotel just outside almeria spain this was jim brown movie star and paul brown wasnt anywhere around sue was back there in cleveland in their little white house with kim kevin and jim jr their three kids the hotel was full of fine plump spanish girls with rosebud mouths and there were a few girls from france and england who always hang around the mediterranean hotels and sleep with tourists and people with money like jim he never spoke to those girls they were tramps he said and besides his main girl eva bohnchin had been down there in aquadulce with him and would be there now if she hadnt had to fly up to london to see a doctor and get the pins removed from her shoulder tliat had been dislocated when she jumped or fell or something from the balcony of jims apartment in hollywood jim was going to have to go back to los angeles and answer charges that he had hit the white cops who had come to investigate that balcony business he was still mad about it because he said the bastards handcuffed my hands behind my back and took me to the lockup just like a common thug they had let him out on bond but he was still mad jim reared back in his deck chair he had on a blue and gold dashiki a pair of tight black pants and a big round medal with a naked woman engraved on it he was barefooted his natural was nappy and he had a sort of tmmeandidontgiveadamnattitiide he could look up four stories and see geraniums blooming in the window boxes of his tworoom deluxe suite and he had aweck in twentiethcentury fox expense money just for pocket change while in spain making rifles his eighth film in three years every now and then a young spanish boy would come trotting out to the terrace witli either a pitcher of fresh orange juice or half a watermelon or jims batteryoperated singer record player and some lou rawls and aretha franklin tunes jim grinned because he knew what i was thinking he knew that i was remembering those old days in cleveland when he thought that having that teddy bearcolored cadillac and riding up and down superior avenue in it and meeting john wooten and some of the other browns players at hearings restaurant or the carnegie hotel lounge was like living real good now here he was one of the hottest properties in hollywood making close to a million dollars this year sitting up tliere overlooking the mediterranean and liaving spanish boys serving him watermelon cooled to his preferred i looked at jim brown movie star and said nigguh youre something else jim kept on grinning but stopped when i hit him real quick with but jim folks back home arc talking about youwell you know talking about you real bad he tensed up bad how he asked eating watermelon all the time like you know theyre saying you left sue back there in cleveland all the time that youve been over here in spain on this movie i said and like they say youre involved with all these different women and youre making sue and your kids real unhappy because of all the publicity about eva and that balcony thing theyre saying that they believe you got mad and threw that girl off that balcony and then got her to say that she fell thats what theyre saying jim he scraped the deck chair across the terrace as he moved up to the table where we were sitting and he was ready i believe had i not had sense enough to look just as big and bad and evil as he did right then to tell me he didnt like anybody getting into his business and if thats what i had come to spain for i could damn well pack up and leave so we just looked at each other and the mediterranean was rolling onto the beach and spanish guitars were being played somewhere in the hotel and it was such a good place to be that jim settled down and said that maybe since everybody seemed so curious about him these days he ought to talk a little about his wife and his women and the kind of woman he wished his wife was and the kind of woman he had to have and why his wife just didnt seem able to keep up with him any longer now that hes jim browm movie star you see jim said there are cases of a man advancing and a woman not advancing she just sort of stands still afraid to move out of her safe comfortable spot but a woman has to keep up with her man educationally and every other way as a man switches careers and moves up his vvoman has to do the same she has to move right along with him she has to move up too right i didnt say anything since i know his wife sue and remember how she had stuck by him when yearold brenda ayres had taken him to couit in cleveland a few years ago on an assault and battery charge and then on a paternity charge i didnt say anything now at this point in my career jim said i need a woman who is educated and charming and able to hold her own anywhere so much of my career now involves meeting people traveling all over the vvorld and things like that so when i have to go some place on a film i need a woman on my arm whos able to meet all kinds of people who makes a striking appearance and who can help me in all kinds of situations she has to be the kind of woman who isnt happy with the way she was years ago she has to be the kind of woman whos constantly seeking to improve herself and improving herself in a way thats an asset to her man its like a man leaving his old neighborhood and going off to college to better himself and then returning to his old neighborhood and meeting his old pals whore still in the same rut that the man got out of a long time ago the man still likes his old pals but he cant afford to let them pull him back down to their level once he has risen above that kind of life see im no longer just a football player out on the field running with a ball and having guys tackle me and then i go to the showers and leave everything behind im in a different bag now its a new bag and an interesting one and i dig it i want to better myself in it so now i find that i need a different kind of woman than what ive had i need a woman whos challenging a woman i can sit down with and discuss things a woman who can teach me something a woman who stimulates me in other than sexual ways could it be i wondered as some other people must have that sue just wasnt good enough for jim brown movie star i took a chance and asked him tliis and he was remarkably calm its not that at all he said sues a great great woman a fantastic woman but shes not interested in tlie kind of life i want to live right now see shes the kind of girl who likes as jafferson in the dirty dozen the kind of man who comes home every evening at a certain hour and shuts the gate on the white picket fence and relaxes in his favorite chair with his favorite pipe and watches the kids feeding the goldfish and playing with the dog well im not that kind of man ive never been and sue has known this and weve talked about it lots of times i tried to be like that at one time but i didnt fit the mold and i decided i wasnt going to make life miserable for both sue and myself just in order to conform to some kind of convention and have people saying oh arent j im and sue the ideal couple and all tliat kind of crap there are a lot of phony people living together like that and theyre just as miserable as they can be jim turned all that over in his mind and said it with a certain casualness that made me wonder if he really believed that sue understood all this and could accept it like a real champ instead of well like splinters under her fingernails then jim became somewhat solemn he said you see marriage is more than just a man and woman living together its more than just a piece of paper that says joe married jane in such and such a town on such and such a day all that paper does is guarantee that jane will get alimony when she and joe decide to split but that paper doesnt have anything to do with love and heart and soul and the socalled marriage doesnt really make a man and woman have any greater love one for the other it might make them live in the same house to satisfy their parents and the public but it doesnt mean anything else and sometimes a man and woman can have a greater love a more meaningful love if they never even went through the ritual of that paper and standing up before the preacher and things like that jim said that he liked the european view of manwoman relations what he meant of course was getting together and shacking up until one got tired of the other and then packing up and leaving and finding something new see if you do it that way you dont fool anybody he said you and everybody else know where its at you can live free and enjoy yourself and not have to fit any kind of mold i asked jim if his new european view meant that it was all over for sue and him and he said weve already talked about a divorce before i came over here i called up my lawyer and told him to do whatever sue wanted i trust her and i know she wont handle the thing in the wrong way itll probaby be a very simple divorce without headlines or anything of tliat sort i just figure that shes a young woman and she deserves a kind of happiness that i can no longer give her so theres no need for us to be unpleasant with each other well just split what about the kids i asked jim well quite naturally theyll be affected by it he said i know because i came up in a broken home but since sue and i will still be friends and ill be visiting the kids a lot i dont think theyll be hurt too much of course theyll have everything that money can buy you knowa home education everything sure enough sue has filed for a divorce and her petition is a nice easygoing one nothing nasty in it all she asked her lawyer to say was that she had been a good and faithful wife and that jim was guilty of gross neglect of duty all she asked for was custody of tlie children her interest in their httle home and reasonable alimony a hearing on the petition will be held in clevelands domestic relations court pretty soon so where are you going to find the kind of woman you say you need now jim i asked ive got her man ive got that

truth said ev erybodys saying that you threw that girl off your balcony did you no he said and im going to tell you like what happened see the girl was in this country on a foreign passport on her german passport see so she didnt want any trouble with the police or anybody because she thought they might ixir her from the states now im going to tell the truth we did have an argument that night hut it wasnt anything really serious we just got loud so the neighbors called the cops novv these cops came to the door and ev a heard me talking to them she got scared and ran out on the balcony and tried to climb off and jump dow n to the ground so the cops wouldnt find her in my apartment she lost her grip and fell thats the truth i looked at lim and didnt sav anvthing he asked me if believed him i told the spanish boy to bring me another piece of watermelon if you dont believe me jim said you can go up to london and ask eva i said that id go jim said hed phone her and sec if it was o k he said he was tired of talking now and w anted to go to bed could talk some more the next day up in the mountains where hed be filming rifiehf he said t hey ild the red and greenstriped umbrella up over jims chair so that the clear spanish sun vvonklnt turn him blacker and blacker and make it rough for the makeup man to match his color in prev ious scenes they were shooting today from the top of a mountain about kilometers northeast of almeria and lim had had edouardo his spanish chauffeur pick him up arlier than usual because of the treacherous mountain roads and because he didnt want to break the tradition that dictates that moie people must be on the set every day by am jim sat under his umbrella and watched everything through outsize goggles that kept the dust out of his eyes his hair was brown with the dust before he went before the cameras hed have to wipe his hair with a damp cloth and gloss it with an oil spray he had brought from california and had giv en to the makeup man jim looked out ov cr the hills and said nothing with his goggles on nobody could tell whether he was looking at raquel welch his costar she sat way off under her own umbrella waiting like jim for director tom cries to get everything ready for their scenes she and jim werent speaking they had soured on each other after the first week or so in spain jim had talked to raquel and had decided that she was he said shallow no depth kind of silly they say that somebody told raquel wliat jim had said so they werent speaking now and jim said he didnt care anyway the heavy love scenes they do together in rifles had already been shot the ones where raquel who plays sarita a hardfighting mexicanindian girl strips down to her underclothes and she and jim who plays lyedecker an american lawman who has joined the indians fight against the mexican government do quite a lot of kissing and struggling in bed i asked jim what he had thought about those love scenes and he said that it had been like lying up in bed with a piece of wood thats just how she affects me cold notliing he said i think she has the idea that i ought to be grateful that she agreed to make this picture with me you know just because we go through all that sex business in the film if thats what she thinks she can go to hell this is a picture that has a heavy manwoman theme im the man raquels the woman well both make a lot of money out of it so why in hell should i be grateful to her for anything to me the whole thing is just a business deal thats all some white reporters have been down here asking me all kinds of silly things about how i feel to be making love to a white woman i have one standard answer its not like this is the first time ive done it baby you know what i mean thats what i tell them and it shakes the hell out of them the white womanblack man talk made jim remember that picture of himself that had appeared last february in the not to be missed section of harpers bazaar he laughed so loud about the fan mail reaction to that picture that raquel glanced over to see what was going on the fullpage picture showed jim naked from the waist uj the muscles of his arms and chest glistening undulyperhaps because hiro the photographer had rubbed him down with mineral oil jim glared off that page in bazaar bearded eyes lowered and looking every bit bedready for all those white women whod probably lock themselves inside bedrooms and rub their manicured fingers over the picture and try to pull off something like the catholics winetoblood miracle and change cold slick paper to warm black flesh i got more mail man from white chicks after that picture ap pcared more mail laughed jim i told jim that knew he had been telling people that business of tts not like this is the first time i n c done it because it had been in the newspapers hack home and some of the brothers had said that he ought to stop bragging about such things and ought not to make pictures in which he has to fall in loe with white girls yon know something jim i said the brothers are saying that since sidney poitier s guess whos cominjs to dinner was such a success and was so acceptable the studios ha e decided to see if they can go farther and make lots of money out of a big black buck like you making love to white girls yeah jim said i know theyre saying that you dont know what the brothers want sometimes do voii they talked about poitier and said he was playing too many safe roles and was always coming oft as tlie nice clean colored hoy in his films now they say jim brown goes too far just because i dont back down from playing roles straight just like the scripts call foryou know no softpedaling on the roles that call for kissing a woman or beating her up or taking her to bed no matter hat color she is now you take the split i made love to a fine black woman diahann carroll but in rifles i take racpicl welch to bed now everybody knows that ihujuel is white e en though slie plays a mcxicanlndian girl in the film another of m films year of the crickety which will be released pretty soon is one in which i play love scenes with another white girl madlyn rliue then im set to make lions christians and thats one in which i xlay a professional football player who romances a wealthy white girl then i might come hack and make a film in which i make love with an african or say a chinese girl i dont care i just play the role and i dont let either white racists or black nationalists limit what i can do nobody tells me that i have to stop making films with white women just to pro e how black i am dont have to run around trying to prove anything its like im not going to stop riding in my mark iii just because all the brothers dont have one and im not going to put on oeralls when i go down south its like some people ask me why i wear my hair afro and why i wear dashikis i do both because i think they make me look better and not because theyre supposed to be some kind of badge of blackness my badge of hlackncss is me jim brown black man and thats more important than any screen roles i play or any styles i want to wear they finally called for jim they had him dangling over the side of a mountain for most of the afttnkudangling on a rope and fighting oft a man who was trying to kill him after a halfhour more for the closeup cameraman jim was through for the day his hair was matted with dirt and his makeup was smeared dirt had gotten into his eyes and he was raising hell with one of the production assistants hccause nobody had been ready with water and towels im sorry mr brown the assistant said but jim wouldnt accept an explanation just do your damn job he told the man its not the first time it has happened and if it happens again you wont be around on the way back to the hotel jim explaincd why he had been rotigh with the assistant see he said these film people are used to dealing with cats that let them get away with anything but they dont mean a damn to me i let em know right off that i didnt come into movies with my hat in my hand asking somebody to do me a favor im not bragging or being an egoist when i say this but i was already a star i was jim brown so my approach to movies has always been that i have something to offer here it is if you want it and ill exchange what i have for whatever hollvwood has to offer jim said he had been successful in movies because of one single factor they knew i was marketable thy knew that whatever name and fame i had could make monev for them because no matter how little or how much talent i had id get good newspaper stories simply because of my background they werent doing me any favors by letting me become an actor and i knew that so i let the producers and the people who nm the studios know that i was up on what was happening and knew how to deal they accepted me on that basis and weve always approached each other mantoman without any of this emotional bs about integrating the movies and being an only black this or a first black that its money with me its dealing with tlie man on economic terms and making his system work for jim brown see emotion tells black people that the white man owes us something but inlcubicnce ought to tell us that hes not going to just give us a damn thing we have to know how to go in and deal jim is president and one of the founders of the negro industrial and economic union an organization that arranges financing for black businessmen and provides business expertise he hatl received some letters from nieu and he was leafing through them as he talked dealing with the white man economically jim said is one of the things were teaching brothers through the nieu see we believe that the closest you can get to independence in a capitalist country is financial independence jim talked on see weve got to find a way to stop begging just like weve got to stop wasting all our energy and money marching and picketing and doing things like campingin down in washington on a poor peoples campaign they didn t accomplish a single thing down there they got a little attention and lots of condescending pats on the back from white liberals who wanted them to keep as quiet as possible and hurry up and get out of town thats all weve got to get off the emotional stuff and do something that will bring about real change weve got to have industries and commercial enterprises and build our own sustaining economic base then we can face white folks mantoman and we can deal jims formula obviously has workedfor him he has become one of the top new actors in hollywood he got only for rio conchos his first picture and only k for the dirty dozen but his eighth one rifles will bring him some in salary plus about five per cent of the boxoffice net he has formed gemini productions and is planning to coproduce a major film and he has been able to invest in businesses ranging from a night club to a hair products business to a new york clothing store according to jims own figures hell gross oh maybe between and million this year jim finished rifles a few weeks ago and returned to the states for a series of gala premieres of the split the world premiere was in chicago so jim flew thcre and they had a big brassbandandkleiglights gala in front of the theater and a cocktail bash in the ambassador east hotel eva bohncliin was on his arm her shoulder had healed and she had flown in from london to be with jim then jim ran over to cleveland for another premiere eva didnt go along in cleveland jim escorted sue his wife jim had told me he was going to do this to wrap up eva in mink and take her to the chicago party then wrap up sue in ermine and march into clevelands palace theater and blow some peoples minds they think sues mad with me just because were getting a diorcc i talked to jim in cleveland and told him what i had told him in spain nigguh youre something else he laughed but he stopped laughing when i told him know what the fellows arc saying about you jim theyre saying that theyre going to follow you around from city to city and find out which hotels youre staying in so that they can stand under your windows and catch anything you throw out
the nine younj men on your december cover should be an inspiration to other negroes male and female they can be proud not only of their natural look but also of their achievements possibly because of their use of their natural and cultivated talents coupled with their natural willingness to work more power to themi many of those who insist on the right to look natural should be rcmindchl however that there is more to being beautiful than having unc ut and tangled and impressed hair tliis applics to black and white alike some of the ualities that go with true beauty are clean minds and bodies iwth of which are tex often missing among the advocates of the natural ickik the color of the skin the texture and cut of the hair is imiuaterial with far too many of its most vocal advocates the stench of dirty ixxlies and clotliing is exceeded only by the stench that comes from the foul language many of them use in regard to your article natural hairnew symbol of race pride by david lloreus i disagrcc with the entertainers who think they have to wear their hair widi the afro cut to show race pride thats a lot of bunk dont believe a person has to have his hair straightened or processed either to show pride i think it is all a matter of personal taste wearing the hair long nat ural dexs not necessarily show pride in your race carrying yourself with dignity and respect for yourself and others does not doing anything that reflects badly on yourself or your race does if a person thinks it improves his apiiearance to have a close hair cut i dont think it subtracts one bit from his pride for his race what about all the negrexs with naturally straiglit hair are they to try to make their hair kinky or make some other part of their dress more african to symbolize their pride as a negro i look upon this natural hair thing more as a trend tlian pride i also think tliat some of tlie wearers of the socalled afro style icxik absolutely deplorable cleanliness is next to godliness if a negro is clean neat and carries himself with dignity kinky hair or straight hair he is showing pride not only in his race but in himself may i commend you for your december editorial a taxing situation an intriguing idea comes to mind in reference to your statement that a poor man cannot deduct the cost of his childrens education as if he wcre giving it as a scholarship outside the family no doubt the loophole would soon be closed blit why couldnt one parent give a scholarship to a given school with the understanding that it would go to a friends childand the friend could do the same for the first parent thus botli children get their educations and no one but uncle sam is the poorer of course the simpler method would be to change the unjust tax laws to allow all parents to deduct

during the years of the worlds most bkkxly ciil war frequently came up it was not long before mr bennett liegan to see an abraham lincoln who was a far cry from the man his tetbooks had told about through the years the evidence even that in the writings of idolatrous lincoln scholars constnicted a lincoln for him who not only was not a friend to the black man but who was in fact a white supremacist in discussions with white lincoln scholars he broached the subject and found that none could dispute his facts their story was that lincolns accomplishments far overshadowcd his faults no one wanted to destroy a myth finally bennett marshaled all his evidence and in several staff meetings convinced all that it was time now to set history straight his article was abraham lincoln a white supremacist starts on page to many both black and white the story may touch on blasphemy but it is ihe truth and in the world of today w e must brave up to facing the truth odierwise we will continue to iic in die lies and confusion diat ha c split this country for more than c years is clothes were the simple dirt and greasestained garments of a man who has had to make it all his life by being nimble with his hands though less obtrusively with his mind he stood before his home a frail tinroofed structure set ahove the ground on concrete blocks and covered with decaying insulbrie as chickens scratched about the tiny barren patch of land he called his own he reminisced about the circumstances that had led him to make a hold decision for early lott sr the new constable in mississippis klanridden jefferson county there was only limited glory in being one of the first negroes elected to public office in that state since reconstruction victory could not erase the memories of growing up in a place where ou never dared talk back to a white man because if you did hed hit you and then thered be or of them heatin on you his one forage into the world bevond the isolated town of favctte miss had hardly been fruitful though hed served as a soldier in world war ii in a segregated unit commanded bv white officers there had been few changes in the intcrviaiing years to differentiate the course of his life from that of a son just recently returned from vietnam and three others still serving in the armed forces i know how it is when you go overseas and take all that ahiiseinent he says in the troubled tones of one irretrievably claimed by bitterness you come hack home thinkin you have a right to speak up for yourself just to find that you still cant be treated like a human being and youre still a slave in a way then he adds those were part of the things that made mo decide to run for office here but there were other things too this is a town where negroes hav e been killed on the streets killed in the jailhoiise things that have happcmied in my lifetime i remember seeing a negro woman kneel down cran beggin for the life of her son up there in the heart of town and the police shot him right before her eyes but the one thing that really made me make up my mind happened not too long ago there was a colored man who couldnt vvalk only got about on his luuids and knees he used to shine shoes to make his way well one day he was up there at the icehouse when a white mana constable from another countydrove up and had some words with him that white man shot him there on the icehouse steps and his blood ran down the street like water there wasnt no trial and there aint nevrr been no trial it was then when i saw that i decided that if the time ever came when id have a chance to try and change things id do it that cripple had been killed because he felt the way i felt hed only tried to speak up for himself like a man the sentiments of early lott sr could be echoed by any one of the black mississippians who surmounted the incredible odds of decades to win public office late last yearsix running as independents and carrying the banner of the dominant democratic party like those they represent they are well acquainted with fear and understand the elements of terror but they have modestly determined to rewrite the bloodv testaments that have shaped their lives this past summer and fall when they like thousands of other long disfranchised black men and women went to the polls in the hardcore south they participated in the first real testing of the voting rights act of which had been described by president johnson as one of the most monumental laws in the entire history of american freedom so these were no ordinary elections by any standards they were the culmination of a protracted stniggle of years marked by political challenges complex legal maneuvers and finally action by congress and they were to test not only the effectiveness of a law that extended the ote to the functionally illiterate and provided federal registrars in racially oppressive areas but were also to weigh the harvest of voter registration campaigns conducted by civil_rights activists as a result of these elections victories vvere scored by black political tyros in a dramatic quest for rights given then so deliberately snatched away during the tumultuous years following the civil war americas stepchildren sought and frequently won office in louisiana and virginia last fall but a special aura surrounded the elections in mississippi those victories represent the first wedge driven into the unyielding power structure of an infamously racist state long considered the worst in the union as far as black folks are concerned it is the first slim ray of hope to penetrate a hell where officially sanctioned savagerx has held so many in silent despair to the rest of the nation black elected officials might seem like a mere drop among the more than whites serving on the district county and state level furthermore the defeated far outnumber the v ictors nearly negroes entered primary and nmoff elections excluding wouldbe candidates who were disqualified under the latest version of mississippis everchanging election laws the most involvedand deliberately soof any state only one victory seemed a big one the election of robert g clark a yearold school teacher as a state representative and even he was having trouble claiming his seat a la georgias julian bond no negro candidates won seats in the state senate and none was elected sheriff the most powerfid and aweinspiring county law officer aside from that one state representative there are merely four negro county supervisors six constables one coroner one chancery clerk and nine justices of the peace but their importance is amplified when it is considered that only two years ago it would have been impossible for even one to be elected in only five per cent of mississippi negroes of voting age vvre estimated to be registered and the state had the lowest registration growth rate in the iiotsosolid south typical of that time was amite county where as recently as three years ago only one negro was registered and according to a resident nobody knew who he was or where he vvas by the figure had climbed to per cent and today stands at per cent in a state vvhere negroes comprise per cent of the population this is just a beginning for veteran voter education workers contend that once the people are registered their v otes can be deliveredtlireats and intimidation notwithstanding they cite instances in the past election where as many as per cent of all negroes registered in some districts or beats as they are called locally cast their votes this is a participation rate many a northern city might envy and it is this phenomenon that leads lawrence guyot yearold firebrand chairman of the militant freedom democratic party to assert today there is possibly more political awareness and activity among negroes in mississippi than in any other state in tliis country to my knowledge those volunteers who have served on the front lines in that embattled territory quickly point out that the number of victories isnt as important as tlie fact that they symbolize a bit of black authority a gradual return to respect for those accustomed to having their lives manipulated by white hands as a whole mississippis newly elected black officials do not fit the common stereotypes of politicians in a society obsessed with superficial niceties most of them would probably go unnoticed in a gathering of those selected for importance most had rural beginnings and many are the sort of roughhevvm local leaders who obtained their degrees in the school of experience to them the whole business of nmning for office and winning has been a matter of rising to an unexpected occasion this is a day i never expected to see exclaims the rev w s scott a natchez preacher and barber who now may add justice of the peace to his titles as he labors ovxr a correspondence course in law he muses if id ever known that this day was coming i would have been ready but one among them is exceptionally ready robtt g clark the first negro to be elected to the mississippi legislature since it was stripped of the last vestiges of reconstructed black_power in had to be exceptional considering the circumstances that shaped his past he was born and reared in ebenezer miss a small tovvm in rural holmes county the fifth poorest county in the nation it gained distinction of sorts in by giving presidential candidate barry goldvvater per cent of its votes the highest proportion of any countv in the u s it also rewarded byron de la beckwith accused of slaying medgar evers with votes in the primary election in which he unsuccessfully sought the office of lieutenantgovernor but it was in this same notorious holmes countv that clark won his bid for the state legislature in though clark sprang from a line of earnest black school teachers and church workers this hardly made his family affluent in conventional terms however they always managed to farm their own land on the side and to keep out of the white mans fields the humiliating experience that has been the bane of so many black mississippians otherwise life was as difficult for him as it was for most young negroes growing up in holmes county i had to walk three miles to school in one direction and four miles the other clark recalls when it came time to go to high school vve had to board in other tovvms for there was no negro high school in the area where i lived and no buses to carry us anvvvhere else with the mildness of manner and rcadv consideration that liavo been his great assets in public life he quickly adds the schools were not luxurious but the teachers did a good job with what little they had to work with unlike most holmes county youngsters clark was fortunate enough to be sent by his parents to jackson college now jackson state college the negro school located in the state capital less than miles south of clarks hometown he helped earn his way by working as a centsanhour custodian in his sophomore year he became the institutions first student to be awarded a track scholarship at that time his career interests lay more in the direction of law than teaching already his sense of social awareness was developing sometimes i didnt feel quite right about being in college he recalls so many of my friends back home couldnt go in spite of his leaning toward law it was teaching that claimed him as a professional after college he taught for seven years at humphrey county training school later moving on to other such negro institutions and attendance centers which white mississippi officials refuse to dignify with the title of high school during all of his teaching assignments he was called upon to coach all sports for both girls and boys while carrying a full class schedule and to do so without extra compensation in fact he had to supilement school athletic programs with money from his own pocket and to provide transportation for some students after practice sessions the year of proved a turning point for clark as well as the nation with the handing down of the supreme court decision against school segregation the ambitious young teacher realized that the time had come to get himself together he recalls up to that time it didnt pay for a negro teacher to be too prepared because he might get kicked out or they would try to use it against him in some way after that time i knew that they would try to use it against him if he wasnt prepared for this reason clark enrolled in graduate courses in education at michigan state university during his summers those sessions in the north brought him into his first close contact with whites being in the classroom with whites he recalls i realized for the first time that they werent really superiorthat sort of thinking that had been dnimmed into us back home i saw that i was capable of doing everything they could do clark earned his masters degree from msu in the field of administration and education later he completed the bulk of his work on a phd degree at the university of michigan but on returning to the mississippi school system he discovered that no matter how much education he had he was still called upon to be a fulltime teacher and coach or viceprincipal and coach when he balked at such treatment school officials withheld his contract itobert clark knew that it was time to make another moe he left the public school system and took a job as athletic director at nearby saints junior college a pri ate school supported by the cdiurch of godinchrist he also became parttime and later fulltime director of the holmes county antipoverty program his experiences with that agency only reinforced his desire to do something to change things to deal with human things as director of an antipoverty program in a county which is per cent black with industry utterly lacking and agricultural jobs disappearing by the day clark had an opportunity to institute a job training program through the dtpartment of public welfare under a halfmilliondollar federal grant all that was required was an educational comonly negro coroner in stale is osborn bell left assistant director of funeral home in holly sprinjjs ho won in marshall county located in northern miss ponent to be conducted through the public school system and the use of its facilities the school board and superintendent refused to sponsor such an adult education program clark remembers ividly that was the only way that it could be done and they refused on the grounds that they felt it wasnt in the best interests of the children or their parents to support it as a result a halfmillion dollars was lost this made me sick when i knew how it was with people coming to my office hungry crying their checks being cut off this showed me that the whites still had no feeling for the negro this was too much to stand clark resigned from the job though he was earning nearly a year exceptional in mississippi he was too bitter to accept the offer of another wellpaying government job in jackson in clark decided to seek a seat in the mississippi state legislature as an independent candidate his political strategy was to garner the support of all the groups to which he belonged plus that of all other black factions in his countvfrom ministers and teachers to people on the plantations he sought a point of common interest with all these divergent groups as a homegrown product of the county in which he was to run he always was able to find one even managing to reach potential nonoters by visiting taverns and engaging in street corner chats clark went into the states november th general election as the candidate of the black people and emerged a victor managing to defeat j p love a white planter from tchula who had served in the mississippi house since and was chairman of the house education committeean ironic twist victory did not surprise clark so much as the fact that he had won with so few votes votes to for his opponent clark had considered that he had possible votes to loves potential but neither tallied such high figures the new black legislator could only surmise that some people didnt vote because of the cultural lag in which they have lived then too some people are still a little scared mostly the elderly but others were cognizant of the fact that clark had polled a higher total of votes than other negro candidates in holmes county indicating that there might have been at least a few whites willing to evaluate the man on the basis of his qualifications instead of his race yet with this victory the battle was not over for clark and seemingly never will be oer for any black who dares to buck the political powersthatbe in mississippi no sooner had he won his legislative seat than his right to be seated was challenged by his defeated opponent on the grounds of alleged irregularities in filing and failing to qualify with the proper election authorities though it was contendei that race was not an issue the whole thing was a tiresome repetition of the old dixie notion that a legislative body can be the judge of its own membership and that when a member happens to be black he is automatically undesirable it was the sort of stumbling block that has hampered other negroes who have managed to succeed politically even while playing the game by curiously weighted rules though clarks victory might be the most spectacular thing to happen to negroes in mississippi for many a day there are others among the newly elected officials who might have a more immediate impact on the daytoday life of their constituents than clark who refers to himself as one black man in the legislature with unfriendly colleagues these are the county superv isors who will sit on the fieman boards that rule supreme over the most important governmental units in a state where residents define their place of birth not by the town but by the county not since reconstruction have black men been represented on these boards that control appropriations to schools hospitals and road construction projects they might be described as joint go ernors of their county units where they make appointments to the board of public welfare deal with the boards of aldermen in the towns for clark every obstacle of this sort is being tackled not only by the nacp and fdp but the lawyers constitutional defense committee of the american civil liberties union his victory is apparent and his right clear beyond that no legal entanglement can blur his personal commitment too easily he remembers a saturday afternoon when as a teacher he escorted several children to the statehouse in jackson a place where no negroes had even set foot on the floor in modem times and wishful black visitors were customarily denied the necessary pass from the speaker of the house we just wanted to see the capitol and they questioned that he says after making us see about or burly guards they finally decided to let us in he was a nisitor then but today he approaches that same building as reputedly the best formally educated man elected to that state legislature above all he is wary of any attempts that might be made to dilute his effectieness by separating him from the people he represents with a quiet determination born of hardwon knowledge he states party lines mean nothing to meif any black man who was running for office came to me i would help him in any way i could i know about the method of putting influential negroes in a position where theyll keep quiet and keep their people down but i dont want one of those positions if i cant do what i want to for my people then its no good of their domain and determine general policy for james jolliff jr a yearold fonner radio announcer and newspaperman there has been nothing in life to compare with the opportunity that now presents itself to him as a newly elected county supervisor in wilkinson county a place which he describes as too per cent povertystricken it is located in the soutliwest corner of the state in a backward racistridden area where we havent even had a negro dogcatcher since reconstruction jolliff who lives in woodville miss and is county president of the naacp is quite aware of the fact that he will control onefifth of the power in his county and intends to use it by appointing a negro to the board of public welfare and by filling all the appointments that comprise his share of patronage when it comes to board decisions he realizes that his vote will frequently be opposed by four white votes during his fouryear tenn but he is aware that negroes are in the majority in his county and asserts if i cant find anyone to vote my way at least ill be able to expose the fraud by going back to the people and telling them this is the way your supervisor voted the one you elected it is also expected that the four whites will not always be in accord and a tvototwo vote would make that fifth black vote a most decisive one such might well be the case on the issue of luring industry to wilkinson county where the average negro family survives on welfare crumbs or farms and ekes out an annual income of between and the problem is that all of our young people are forced to leave observes mon c allen jolliffs sidekick a high school teacher in woodville where he found himself suddenly without a job after announcing his unsuccessful candidiicy for sheriff allen is well acquainted with the sense of frustration that impells hordes of young mississippi negroes to leave the state each year in search of greener pastures up north there is absolutely nothing for the young people where we come from says allen not even recreational facilities kids have to break into the school to play its so bad in the seven years ive been teaching in wilkinson county id estimate that weve lost at least a thousand negro youths the terrible thing is that theres a white conspiracy to keep industry out so that negroes will continue to leave voter registration figures will remain low and whites will retain control one of jollifits main projects will be to attack the boards of aldermen that block industry and thus vital jobs it is an overwhelming challenge for one man but he willingly accepts it we must realize that the real answer is to stay here and to make things better jolliff insists most negroes run off to chicago new orleans or california not realizing that theyre just going from a small ghetto to a large one but i wouldnt trade mississippi for all the tea in china sure theres guys pushing you here but you just got to push back i dont want to run away because i see this as a resolution and i think that within years everything here will be changed completely few people are more aware of the need to create a new system in mississippi than the parents who have lost their children to strange cities in faraway places theyve never seen one of them is mrs martha lee a modestly educated but perceptive and determined farmers wife who lises in a tiny house off a dirt road in an almost invisible hamlet called red lick it was while attending voter education workshops that she first became aware of the need to participate in politics on whatever level she could four of her five children had left home she had the time to campaign for the office of justice of the peace and the confidence of her constituents to win of her children who have left for the larger mississippi city of vicksburg peoria ill washington d c and trenton n j she wistfully says yes id like for them to come home but theres really nothing for them to do and no place for them to work other factors beside employment might also be involved like that of rampant injustice mrs lee knows for although her husbands father bought the acre plot of land which they farm back in in the county mysteriously claimed that their property was part of the school distiict allotment ever since that year theyve been forced to pay a year rent on their own land and the taxes too yet there is nothing they can do they cant afford a lawyer not all problems in mississippi will be solved or even tackled effectively by use of the vote but it can be the key that will enable the states long deprived people to gain access to their fair share of federal and state funds and programs this is the sort of longrange thinking that motivates the professionals who worked so arduously behind the scenes to engineer the recent election victories for success was not a matter of sheer chance like most en cnts in history it did not simply happen but was caused it was the end result of an unusual coalition of groups not always in accord at one end was lawrence guvot and his freedom democratic partv which seeks to replace the states established democratic partv stnicture with one rooted in the awaken ing black populace at the other end was charles evers the clever and strongwilled mississippi field director for the naacp it has been evers contention that black politicians must penetrate the allpowerful democratic partv in the state and work within it since it controls patronage and is a direct line to national powers unaligned with either one but not indifferent was the delta ministry a nonpartisan educational project sponsored by the national council of churches and an outgrowth of the freedom summer of abandoning old arguments based on different methods of approach the three were able to work together for the common goal all shared and to employ the legal knowhow of the naacp legal and educational defense fund as well as the state legal arm of the american civil liberties union all brought different tools to the battle but all joined in stumping the state on behalf of voter registration and education they shared the victories and from the defeats they learned other vital lessonsthe necessity to have negro election managers to assist the illiterates in order that they might not be intimidated or misled into voting for a candidate not of their choice the need to disperse political power among the masses instead of nesting it in a few personalities the knowledge that negroes in many parts of mississippi are still so economically dependent and emotionally browbeaten that they will not always vote for a black candidate even when thev have the chance as kermit stanton a negro elected county supervisor in northern bolivar county put it where i come from a lot of people are still afraid of being put outdoors they are still dependent on the vviite man for an occasional job and the only way we can really improve our political situation is to alleviate pov erty but the most important object lesson is to be found in the plain words of early lott sr the constable with a cause looking beyond the knot of ramshackle huts where his own house stands at black and white children playing together on the hillside in front of an elementarv school he remarks thats something that took us years to do and the white folks said wed never do it but theres other things weve got to do now i know ive got to do a good job that all of us here have got to succeed we cont fail because if vve fail here negroes everywhere will fail weve got to realize that the negro in the north and the negro in the south are all the same family j maybe some were luckier than others but i know that well only make it when we can i stand as one from maine to mississixpil is the fact that the real lincoln was a tragically flawed figure who shared the racial prejudices of most of his white contemporaries if despite the record lincoln has been misunderstood and misinterpreted it is not his fault a conservative illinois lawyer cautious and conventional in social matters lincoln never pretended to be a racial liberal or a social innovator he said repeatedly in public and in private that he was a firm believer in white supremacy and his acts supported his assertions not only that lincoln had profound doubts about the possibility of realizing the rhetoric of the declaration of independence and the gettysburg address on this soil and he believed until his death that black people and white people would be much better off separatedpreferably with the tlantic ocean or some other large and deep body of water betvveen them tlie mans character his way with words and his assassination together with the psychological needs of a racist society have obscured these contradictions under a mountain of mvths which un doubtedly would have amused lincoln who had a wonderful sense of the ironic and ridiculous the mythmakers have not only buried the real lincoln they have also managed to prove him wrong he said once that it was impossible to fool all of the people all of the time but his apotheosis clearly proves that it is possible to fool enough of them long enough to make a conservative white supremacist a national symbol of racial tolerance and understanding if the lincoln myths were the harmless fantasies of children at play it would be possible to ignore them but when the myths of children become adult daydreams and when the daydreams are used to obscure deep social problems and to hide historical reality it becomes a social duty to confront them when at the height of the summer rebellion season president lyndon b johnson said he intended to follow a lincolnian course professor vincent p harding of spelman college rebuked him pointing out in a letter to the new york times that lincolns vacillating civil war posture was a prescription for social disaster today because as professor harding suggested we are environed by dangers and because we need all the light we can get because braham lincoln is not the light because he is in fact standing in the light hiding our way because a real emancipation proclamation has become a matter of national survival and because no one has ever issued such a document in this countryheaxuse finally lies enslave and because the truth is always seemly and proper it has become urgently necessary to reevaluate the lincoln mythology the need for such a reevaluation has already been recognized in some scholarly circles some scholars have confronted the ambiguities of the emancipation proclamation and have suggested that lincolns reputation would be more securely based if it were grounded not on that document but on his services as leader of the victorious north analyzing the same evidence david donald said in lincoln reconsidered that perhaps the secret of lincolns continuing vogue is his essential ambiguity he can be cited on all sides of all questions donald was not quite correct for lincoln cannot be cited on the side of equal rights for black people a fact that has discomfited more than one lincoln day orator commenting on lincolns determined opposition to a policy of emancipation professor kenneth stampp vvtote indeed it may be said that if it was lincolns destiny to go down in history as the great emancipator rarely has a man embraced his destiny with greater reluctance than he to understand lincolns reluctance and his painful ambivalence on the question of race one must see him first against the background of his times bom into a poor white family in the slav e state of kentucky and raised in the antiblack environments of southern indiana and illinois lincoln was exposed from the very beginning to racism it would have been difficult if not impossible for young abrabam lincoln to emerge unscathed from this environment by an immense effort of transcendence worthy of admiration and long thought lincoln managed to free himself of most of the cmdities of his early environment but he did notand perhaps could notrise above the racism that was staining the tissue of the nations soul it appears from the record that lincoln readily absorbed the negro stereotypes of his environment for he ever afterwards remained fond of negro dialect jokes blackface minstrels and negro ditties like most white men professor benjamin quarles wrote lincoln regarded the negro as such as funny more to the point lincoln as quarles also noted regarded the negro as inferior tliere is a pleasant story of lincoln awakening to the realities of slavery on a visit to new orleans in according to the traditional account an aroused lincoln said if i ever get a chance to hit that thing slavery ill hit it hard since the man who reported this statement did not accompany lincoln to new orleans the story is of dubious value more telling is the fact that lincoln distinguished himself as a public official by a reluctance to hit slavery at all in the general literature lincoln is depicted as an eloquent and flaming idealist whaling away at the demon of slavery this view is almost totally false in the first place lincoln was an opportunist not an idealist he was a man of the fence a man of the middle a man who stated the principle with great eloquence but almost always shied awy from rigid commitments to practice contrary to reports lincoln was no social revolutionary as a matter of fact he was an archetypal example of the cautious politician who assails the extremists on both sides it is not for nothing that cautious politicians sing his praises it should be noted secondly that lincolns position on slavery has been grossly misrepresented lincoln was not opposed to slavery he was opposed to the extension of slav ery more than that lincoln was opposed to the extension of slav ery out of devotion to the interests of white people not out of compassion for suffering blacks to be sure he did say from time to time that slavery was a monstrous injustice but he also said repeatedly that he was not prepared to do anything to remove that injustice where it existed on the contrary he said that it was his duty to tolerate and if necessary to give practical support to an evil supported by the u s constitution more damaging is the fact that lincoln apparently believed that immediate and general emancipation would be a greater evil than slavery itself eulogizing henry clay on july he associated himself with that slaveowners colonization ideas and said that clav did not perceive as i think no wise man has perceived how it slavery could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself in other speeches of the same period lincoln commended travel to black people and noted with admiration that the children of israel went out of egptian bondage in a body a third point of significance is that lincolns opposition to the extension of slavery was a late and anomalous growth in the s and s in the midst of one of the greatest moral crises in the history of america lincoln remained silent and lamentably inactive in his few public utterances on the subject in the s and s he very carefully denounced both slavery and the opponents of slav cry for many white northerners the most agonizing moral issue of the day was the fugitive slave law vvhich required all americans to assist in the capture and return of runaway slaves many whites some of them quite conservative refused to obey the law others more daring organized an open resistance movement movring runaway slaves from station to station on the underground railway instead of aiding this effort lincoln opposed it publicly announcing his support of the fugitive slave law in a private letter to joshua f speed in he said i confess i hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and unrewarded toils but i bite my lip and keep quiet lincoln came down off the fence rhetorically in the s when the kansasnebraska act reopened the whole question of the extension of slaery to the largely uninhabited territories of the west this was he said a clear and present threat to free white men and to what he called the white mans charter of freedomthe declaration of independence in his public speeches of this period lincoln was given to saying in the same speech that he believed in white supremacy as a practical matter and in the declaration of independence as an abstract matter of principle tlie lincoln years in illinois were years of oppression and reaction black people could not vote testify against white people in court or attend public schools it was a crime for free black people to settle in the state although lincoln was a powerful figure in state politics for more than a quarter of a century he made no audible protest against this state of aflfairs in fact he said he preferred it that way when h ford douglas a militant black leader asked lincoln to support a mo einent to repeal the law banning black testimony lincoln refused in the famous series of debates with stephen douglas lincoln made his position crystal clear he was opposed he said to negro citizenship and to the niggers and the white people marrying together speaking at charleston illinois on september lincoln said i will say then that i am not nor e er hae been in fa or of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races applause that i am not nor ever have been in faor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to bold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical diflference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race lincoln grew during the warbut he didnt grow much on eery issue relating to the black manon emancipation confiscation of rebel land and the use of black soldiershe was the very essence of the white supremacist with good intentions in fact lincoln distinguished himself as president by sustained and consistent opposition to the fundamental principle of the proclamation that guaranteed his immortality incredible as it may seem now the man who would go down in history as the great emancipator spent the first months of his administration in a desperate and rather pathetic attempt to save slavery where it existed he began his presidential career by saying that he had neither the powder nor the desire to interfere with slavery in the states and be endorsed a proposed thirteenth amendment which would have guaranteed that slavery would never be molested in existing states and washington d c my policy lincoln said is to have no policy in this famous statement lincoln was something less than candid for he did have a policy and that policy was to win the war without touching slavery it is the desire of the president secretary of war simon cameron wtote a general on august s that al existing rights in all states be fully respected and maintained when lincolns policy foundered on the reef of southern intransigence lincoln complained sadly to a friend i struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the institution in accordance with the real policy of the lincoln administration the war department refused to accept black troops and union generals vied with each other in proving their fealty to slaxery some generals returned fugitive slaves to rebel owners others said that if black slaves staged an uprising behind enemy lines they would stop fighting the enemy and turn their fire on their black friends union officers who refused to go along with the softonslax ery policy were courtmartialed and cashiered out of the service when in august general john c fremont emancipated missouri slaves lincoln angrily countermanded the proclamation telling fremonts wife that general fremont should not have dragged the negro into it a year later when general david hunter freed the slaxes in three southern states lincoln again countermanded the order saying that emancipation was a presidential function that this policy was changed at all was due not to lincolns humanitarianism but to rebel battlefield brilliance and the compassion and perseverance of a small band of radical republicans foremost among these men were charles sumner the u s senator from massachusetts wendell phillips the brilliant agitator from boston frederick douglass the bearded black abolitionist and thaddeus stevens the pennsylvania congressman who virtually supplanted abraham lincoln as the leader of the republican party as the war continued and as northern casualties mounted the radical republicans put events to use and mobilized a public pressure lincoln could not ignore delegation after delegation waited on the president and demanded that he hit the south where it would hurt most by freeing the slaves and arming them lincoln parried the pressure with heat and conviction citing constitutional political and military reasons to justify his antiemancipation stand lincoln usually expressed his opposition to emancipation in a troubled but polite tone but he could be pushed across the border of politeness when edward l pierce urged the president to adopt a more enlightened policy lincoln according to pierce exploded and denounced the itching to get niggers into our lives the traditional image of lincoln is of a harried and largehearted man fending off extremists of the left and right only to emerge at the precise psychological moment to do what he had always wanted to do this image clashes unfortunately with ex idence xvhich suggests that sudden and general emancipation xvas never lincolns policy lincoln xvas gix en to saying that his constitutional duties prevented him from doing anything substantial to give point to his oftexpressed personal xvish that all men ex eryxvhere could be free but it is obvious from the ex idence that lincolns problems xvere deeper than that for xvhen his dutv xxas clear he refused to act on several oc casions he refused to take antislax ery action xvhich xvas mandated by congress and he sabotaged some antislaxery legislation by executive inaction somehoxv duty in lincolns viexv almost alxvays xvorked against the black man lincoln defenders say that he resisted emancipation pressures because of his fear that premature action xvould alienate xvhite supporters in northern and border states and endanger the prosecution of the xvar but this x iexv does not come to grips xvith the fact that lincoln was personally opposed to sudden and general emancipation before and the further fact that he continued to oppose sudden and general emancipation after the circulating proclamation proved that his fears were groundless nor does the traditional lincoln apologia touch the mass of evidenccin lincoln letters as xvell as in private and public statementsxxhich shoxxs that lincoln was personally opposed to sudden emancipation on social and racial grounds it xvas not the fear of emancipation but the fear of what xvould happen afterxxards that palsied lincolns hands he xvas deeply disturbed by the implications of turning loose four million black people in a land he considered the peculiar preserxe of the xxhite man he spoke often of the ex ils of sudden derangement and xvarned congress against the xagrant destitution xvhich must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities xvhere their numbers are xery great he said oxer and oxer again that it xvas his considered judgment that gradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all count adam guroxvski believed lincoln xvas concerned about poor xvhite fear of black competition be sure he xxtote in a may letter that lincoln is at heart xvith slax ery he considers that emancipation is a job which will smother the free states sttch are his precise words lincoln also feared racial conflict like manv white liberals he xxas consumed bx fears of black xiolence more than one visitor to the white house found him in agony oxer the possibility of a nat turnerlike uprising behind the enemys lines an additional factor in lincolns opposition to the principle of sudden emancipation xxas his racial bias he considered black people unassimilable aliens there xvas not in his xiexv enough room in america for black and xxhite people he didnt believe xvhite people xxonld sanction equal rights for black people and he didnt ask xvhite people to sanction equal rights for black people since he did not propose to confront racism he told black people they xvould have to trax l or accept a subordinate position in american life insofar as it can be said that lincoln had an emancipation policy it xvas to rid america of slaxes and negroes when he failed in his attempt to end the xxar xvithout touching slavery he fell back to a second plan of gradual and compensated emancipation extending oxer a yearperiod this xvas linked in his thinking xvith a companion policy of colonizing black people in south america or africa as the pressure for emancipation rose lincoln argued passionately and eloquently for his plan of gradual emancipation and abrupt emigration on august he called a handpicked group of black men to the white house and proposed a black exodus in a curious mixture of condescension and kindness to use james m mcphersons phrase lincoln told the black men that it xvas their duty to leave america aou and xve he said are different races we have betxveen us a broader difference than exists betxxeen almost any other txvo races whether it is right or xvrong need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffer very greatly many of them by living among us while oius suffer from your presence lincoln did not seek the opinions of his visitors he did not propose he said to discuss racism to debate whether it was founded on reality or justice he was simply he said presenting a fact white people didnt want black people in america and therefore black people would have to go there is he said an unwillingness on the part of our people harsh as it may be for you free colored people to remain with us the only solution lincoln said was a black exodus it is better for us both he said to be separated he proposed a black settlement on central american land rich in coal and he asked his visitors to help him find black settlers capable of thinking as white men although lincolns plan received a generally hostile reception in the black community he pursued it with passion and conviction for several months after the signing of the emancipation proclamation he was deeply invoked in a disastrously abrtie attempt to settle hlack people on an island off the coast of haiti when that venture failed he shifted to the southwest conferring with contractors on the feasibility of settling black people in the state of texas wiile lincoln was trying to send black people away congress was busy emancipating in the spring and summer of congress forbade military officers to return fugitive slaves authorized the president to accept black soldiers and emancipated the sla es in washington d c finally on july congress passed the second confiscation act which freed the slaves of all rebels this act which has receied insufficient attention in general media was actually more sweeping than the preliminary emancipation proclamation which came two months later lincoln followed congress lead slowly and grudgingly signing most of these acts with evident displeasure but the drift of events was unmistakable and lincoln changed steps saying with great honesty that he had not controlled events but had been controlled by them conferring with the member of a congressional committee charged with drafting a plan for buying the slaves and sending them away lincoln urged speed saying you had better come to an agreement niggers will never be cheaper orthography apart lincoln caught here the spirit of the times at that moment in late july of the union war effort was bogged down in the marshes of virginia and england and france were on the verge of intervening on the side of the confederacy at home the heat was rising fast fueled by mounting northern casualties faced with mushrooming pressures at home and abroad lincoln reversed his course and conditionally determined to use his words to touch the institution of slaverv lincoln adopted the new policy from necessity not conviction in public and in private he made it clear that he was not motiated by compassion for the slaves taking his stand on the ground of military necessity he said his new policy was designed to weaken southern white men and to strengthen the hand of northern white men things he said later had gone from bad to worse till i felt we had reached the end of the rope on the plan of operation we had been pursuing and that we had about played our last card lincoln said he was dri en to the alternative of either surrendering the union and with it the constitution or of laying a strong hand upon the colored element there was truth in this but it was not the whole truth there is evidence that lincoln was forced to adopt the new policy by political pressures edward stanly military governor of north carolina said lincoln told him that the proclamation had become a ci il necessity to prevent the radicals from openly embarrassing the go eminent in the conduct of the war the president expressed the belief that without the proclamation for which they had been clamoring the radicals would take the extreme step in congress of withholding supplies for carrying on the warleaving the whole land in anarch count gurowski gave a similar version of lincolns metamorihosis and concluded in a fine phrase that lincoln was literally whipped into glory responding to a parallelogram of pressures lincoln issued a preliminary emancipation proclamation on september in this document he warned the south that he would issue a final emancipation proclamation in days if the rebellion had not ended by that time the proclamation outlined a future policy of emancipation but lincoln had no joy in the black harvest to a group of serenaders who congratulated him on the new policy lincoln said i can only trust in god i have made no mistake to his old friend joshua f speed lincoln expressed misgivings and said he had been anxious to a oid it to congressman john covode of pennsylvania lintxjln explained that he had been dricen to it adding but although my duty is plain it is in some respects painful still another visitor i edward stanly receied a dramatic account of lincolns resistance to a policy of emancipation mr lincoln said according to stanly that he had prayed to the almighty to sa e him from this necessity adopting the very language of our saviour if it be possible let this cup pass r from me but the prayer had not been answered i on thursday january lincoln drank from the cup and i apparently he liked neither the flavor nor the color of the draught when he started to sign the document his arm trembled so violently j an eyewitness said that he could not hold the pen lincoln who was very superstitious paused startled then attributing his shakes to hours of handshaking at a new years day reception he scrawled his name saying he did not want the signature to be tremulous because people would say lie had some compunctions he had compunctions j nothing indicates this better than the emancipation proclamation which is as j g randall and richard n current indicated more often admired than read cold forbidding with all the moral grandeur of a real estate deed the proclamation does not enumerate a single principle hostile to slavery and it contains not one quotable sentence i as a document it lends weight to the observation of lincolns law partner william herndon who wrote when he freed the slaves there was no heart in the act there wasnt much else in it either rightly speaking the emancipation proclamation as ralph komgold wrote was not an emancipation proclamation at all the document was drafted in such a way that it freed few if any sla es it did not apply to slaves in the border states and areas under federal control in the south in other words lincoln freed sla es where he had no power and left them in chains where he had power the theory behind the proclamation an english paper noted is not that a human being cannot justly own another but that he cannot own him unless he is loval to the united states the proclamation argues so powerfully against itself that some scholars have suggested that lincoln was trying to do the opposite j of what he said he was doing in other words the suggestion is that the emancipation proclamation was a political stratagem by which lincoln hoped to outflank the radicals buy time and forestall a definitive act of emancipation this is not the place to review the political stratagem theory in detail suffice it to say that on the basis of the evidence one can make a powerful case for the view that lincoln neer intended to free the slaes certainly not immediately lincolns postproclamation behaior lends substance to this view for contrary to all logic he continued to agitate against his own j policy on the ee of the proclamation he again recommended to congress his favorite plan of gradual and compensated emancipation and he continued according to several witnesses to doubt the wis dom of the emancipation proclamation three weeks after signing the document he reportedly told wendell phillips that the proclamation was a great mistake two months later he told congressman george w julian that the proclamation had done about as much harm as good in the following months lincoln repeatedly said that he still favored a gradual emancipation plan which contradicted the spirit of his own proclamation to this bleak picture one should add in all justice that lincoln s can be quoted on both sides of the issue he reportedly said later that the proclamation and the arming of black soldiers constituted the heaviest blows against the rebellion it should also be said that lincoln after a period of acillation and doubt helped to win passage of the thirteenth amendment which made the paper freedom of m the proclamation real having said that it remains to be said that lincoln never fully accepted the fundamental principle of the procla j mation and the thirteenth amendment as late as february he was still equivocating on the issue of immediate emancipation at an abortive peace conference with confederate leaders at hamp ton roads virginia lincoln said according to alexander stephens that he had never been in favor of immediate emancipation even by the states lie spoke of the many evils attending immediate emancipation and suggested as he had suggested on other occasions a system of apprenticeship by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relations to each other at gettysburg lincoln shifted gears and announced a new policy of liberation and social renewal america he said was engaged in a great war testing whether it or any other nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal could long endure the war he said would decide whether government of the people by the people for the people would perish from the earth but days later when he un eiled his own postwar policy it was obvious that all meant the same thing to lincoln that it had always meant all white people in his proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction lincoln said he would recognize any rebel state in which onetenth of the white otcrs of took an oath of allegiance to the united states and organized a government which renounced slavery what of black people slavery apart lincoln ignored them incredibly the commanderinchief of the u s army abandoned his black soldiers to the passions of confederate veterans who feared and hated them lincoln barely suggested priately that it would be a good thing for southern states to extend the ballot to the ery intelligent negroes and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks but these were private sentiments not public acts and they were expressed in an extremely hesitant manner at that lincoln didnt require fair or equal treatment for the freedmen in fact he didnt make any demands at all reconstniction lincoln style was going to be a reconstruction of the white people by the white people and for the white people it seems that lincoln never reconciled himself to the implications of emancipation shortly before his death lincoln summoned general benjamin f butler to inquire about the possibilities of sending the blacks away according to butler he said i wish you would examine the question and give me your views upon it and go into figures as you did before in some degree as to show whether the negroes can be exported butler went away and came back two days later with a sad story mr president he said i have gone very carefully over my calculation as to the power of the country to export the negroes of the south and i assure you that using all your naval vessels and all the merchant marine fit to cross the seas with safetv it will be impossible for you to transport to the nearest place fit for them half as fast as negro children will be born here lincolns assassination and the aggressive dissemination of the m assa linkun myth pushed the real lincoln with his real limitations into the background and black people were soon pooling their pennies to erect a monument to the mythical emancipator when on april this monument was unveiled with president u s grant and other high officials in attendance frederick douglass punctured the myths and looked frankly at the man douglass praised lincolns growth but he also rehearsed his limitations truth douglass said is proper and beautiful at all times and in all placesy and it is never more proper and beautiful in any case than when speaking of a reat public man whose example is likely to be commended for honor and imitation long after his departure to the solemn shades the silent continent of eternity it must be admitted truth compels me to admit even here in the presence of the monument we have erected to his memory abraham lincoln was not in the fullest sense of the word either our man or our model in his interests in his associations in his habits of thought and in his prejudices he was a white man he was preeminently the white man s president entirely devoted to the welfare of white men in all his education and feeling he was an american of the americans speaking thus of interests and passion and public acts frederick douglass who knew lincoln well sounded the discordant notes of a national not a personal tragedy for in the final analysis lincoln must be seen as the embodiment not the transcendence of the american tradition which is as wc all know a racist tradition in his inability to rise above that tradition lincoln often called the noblest of all americans holds up a flawed mirror to the american soul and one honors him today not by gazing fixedly at a flawed image not by hiding warts and excrescences but by seeing oneself in the reflected ambivalences of a life which calls us to transcendence not imitation l oneliness is yet another tragedy of war the tragedy which grips the women who are left behind for them there is always the fearful question will he come back alive the question hits with each newscast with each deadandwounded count which is read it seems with no more emotion than reports of highs and lows on the new york stock exchange in the flat farmlands of central kansas the loneliness hangs heavy the question hits hard for it is here that a uniejue community has been formed it is a community of womenall of them waiting for their men to return from such places as dak to qiiang tri dong ha and saigon all of them waiting wives two hundred of the women are negro and they and their children have settled with all the others at junction city kansas at a mihtary housing project called schilling manor and at ft riley from which custer once rode off to fight the hostiles at little big horn more than xx infantrymen have gone through training at ft riley during the last three years many families joined them there then stayed on when the men shipped out to vietnam now they wait listening to the broadcasts seeing the tv film clips of the fighting rushing to meet postmen who might have letters with bits of news there is little else for the wives to do except for the usual onbase facilities the area provides not much more than sleazy bars prosperouslooking churches a kiwanis club or tvvo and an old movie house the army tries valiantly to offer a bit more there is a waiting wives club a ceramics group a church choir bingo nights at the noncommissioned officers club and theres even a chitterling club whose members cook soul food whenever they get the urge still there are the long days and a chaplain making an unexpected visit will cause apprehension in the neighborhood and a man frequenting a house next door will trigger hours of gossip most of the women live at ft riley and schilhng manor in military housing allotted according to family size and husband s rank others live in their own homeshouses bought around junction city before their husbands shipped out these private homeowners are the more fortunate ones tliey unlike the others are not forced to vacate houses when a killed in action telegram arrives they can stay on in kansas if they wish and try to build new lives one of those who has stayed on is mrs nathalie gerald she owns a small neat home in one of junction citys newer neighborhoods her husband ssgt bozy gerald was when he left for his first vietnam tour two years ago he was eager to go a career soldier who had fought in italy in world war ii he had trained a company of men at ft riley for jungle warfare his men called him a soldiers soldier a real rough disciplinarian but a guy who was always on your side always ready to help you out mrs gerald received three or four letters from him almost every day he never mentioned the danger he faced then several months after he had left she had a visitor it was the chaplain to tell her that bozy gerald who had served his country for years would not be coming home again neither would any of the men he had trained he and his company had been ambushed and wiped out in a jungle somewhere in vietnam he never talked about dying mrs gerald says all the time in his letters he would write that when he came back we would do this and we would do that he said that he might retire when he came home again and that wed settle right here in junction city he was supposed to come back last june when his companys tour was up he planned to come on back then i epected him the military wives believe that a soldiers chance of survival iii vietnam depends on his attitude if he is confident ambitious and hard hghting like sgt gerald he will escape the viet cong wife after wife will explain my jf always says he will get out all right he has every confidence in the world so i dont see any need to worry but the cases like sgt gerald who should have come back stun the community as one chaplain says theres a cloud of apprehension over schilling manor and the base no matter how brave the wives try to be or how busy they keep themselves tm afraid its not much fuii living under these conditions mrs gerald talks calmly of her husbands death but her eyes are sad since my husband was a military man i just accept his death she explains she and her eightyearold son john received the silver star this summer in recognition of sgt geralds service but her son doesnt really understand why his father had to die none of his friends have lost their daddies his mother says neighborhood children used to taunt him amieres your daddy why isnt he coming home i just told him vour daddy died a hero and i think now hes very proud of his father at first i felt bitter but now i think the vietnam war i is something that has to be done i the chaplain at the church of our saviour where mrs gerald and several other widows devote their time to charitv work savs you cant really tell how some of these women take their husbands deaths you feel theres a deep loneliness a tragic sorrowbut they hide it nathalie geralds life now revolves around her son now i just want to do whats best for my little boy she says i hope hell go to college with the scholarship he received from bozys outfit i try not to think anymore about my husband but every time i go by the post i like to look at the graveyard i can always see his grave right there when i go by i like to think that hes not dead that hes just away for a while the war takes on a different meaning when the husband is a highranking officer good tour in vietnam usually means a promotion and another step up the status ladder although all wives experience moments of depression officers wives on the whole are a rigorously disciplined group a woman whose husband is bucking to be brigadier general will be very careful with whom she associates while he is away a few negro women charge that other sisters would only talk to their white counterparts because they thought this would further their husbands careers with gossip swirling around their heads these wives are forever on guard to protect their status foothold in the community mrs etta mcafee lives in one of ft rileys more comfortable homes while her husband maj floyd mcafee is away on his second stint in vietnam he first went to the country in as an advisor to the south vietnamese forces she has never questioned his chances for survival the first time i had some shaking worries she says but this time im more adjusted he told me tm going to be back and i know he will mrs mcafee is an experieneed army wife who accepts as a matter of course the peculiarities of the military she is no longer fazed by the booming salute of the post cannon three times a day the official house inspections or the frequent moves to different army bases the transient anny life has taught her never to make real close friends at any base to be friendly but not intimate as a result of their experience and maj mcafees success the family tends to be achievementoriented during his first vietnam tour mcafee took hundreds of color slides of the people and their villages when he returned he spoke to colleges and civic groups on customs traditions and living conditions of the vietnamese people as range maintenance oflbcer at ft riley before his second tour he built a realistic vietnamese village on the base to train infantrymen he also served as the voice of kansas to sell u s savings bonds on radio etta mcafee in turn has taken on a load of civic duties ranging from work in a head start program to teaching a citizenship class of immigrant women these activities at one time took up almost a hour week she says her four children are good students able atliletes and polite to perfection they address their elders as sir or maam yet etta mcafee admits that maintaining firm discipline in her home has been most trying all my husband has to do is look at these children and they obey she says her terse nononsense orders to the kids are not always as effectwe most of the wives agree that this fillingthefather role creates problems for them like many officers wives mrs mcafee is concerned that her children get the best upbringing with the best people but she herself has shunned social gatherings while her husband has been away she explains i feel out of if and alone when everybody else is with her husband in spite of this should maj mcafee decide to take a third tour in vietnamand she feels he must if the war continuesshe will accept his decision because he knows what he must do and we must stick bv him not everv wife is as confident mrs lena mae btd lives in a junction citv area near the clubs that swarm with soldiers on saturday nights she is candid about the miseries of waiting alone while her husband sgt fred byrd a former boxing champion and a year army veteran fights in vietnam after he left she wrote president johnson how she was praying for the men in the war i get so low she explains that praying is about the only thing left for me i believe in prayer and encourage everyone to pray for their loved ones over there mrs byrd has kept herself busy during the last weeks by completely redecorating her small bungalow so my husband would have a nice home to come back to and her living room has been cluttered with wooden planking hammers and paint cans but the first few months after his departure she stayed at home and worried alxut his safety i would have cracked un without prayer she admits actually once i did crack up for hours i was ready to leave the hospital after an operation and for somu reason i thought my husband would be waiting for me at home when he wasnt there i thought he had died i sent for the feiv al wreath and made all the preparations even now im so denressd at times i went to a psychiatrist and he gave me pills whih mv husband has been away ive been irritable forever screaming at my kids and these kids they dont pay me no mind her three children proudly bring out photos and mementos of their father as mrs bvrd continues while hes been awav ive had t no desire to make company im glum and so is ev erybody else i dont want to talk about him but mv mind is continuallv on him he vvtites me five or six letters every dav and vhen he tells me he has to go out on a mission i get tensed up she laughed you notice my overloaded medicine shelf over thtea pdl for every occasion and mood when the men first left ft biley th psychiatrist did a booming business with waiting wives mrs byrds only outside interest is ciil rights but despite her membership in the local better race relations committee and the open housing commission she has no sympathy for war protestors or militant blacks who say that the federal government should abandon the vietnam war these war protestors show infantile thinking she says we must protect democracy were not necessarily protecting only a small country but our own nation yes we have a putrid situation race problems in our own country but we must work on it on the local level not just on the federal level wdien the wives get the blues around ft riley they like to think how much better oflf thev are than the women who live an hours drive away at schilling manor thank god i dont have to live there several of the wies remarked a former strategic air command post which closed in the housing project at the manor covers acres and provides homes for women and their children it is the only housing project of its kind in the country and at first glance it is a depressing place rows of identical houses dot the flat treeless area in the middle of the farm communitv of salina m the only men these women ever see are the chaplain the dentist and other members of the skeleton militarv staff who run the manor to see these wives at their monthly waiting wives club luncheon is to see boredom at its worst the luncheon is a nearlv silent affair most of the ladies seem to prefer eating their rolled beef patty to talking with women theye seen much too often yet almost all of them will say yes we reallv loe it here and flash a mechanical smile why do they come to such a place maj william c coate the officer in charge says that many wives choose to live at the project because the housing is cheap and offers privileges such as a lowcost commissary and px another factor has been a chronic shortage of housing for aietnam military dependents at regidar bases for the some negro wives at schilling manor finding decent civilian housing has iroved a major problem in some parts of the country although all of the women at the manor are married to career servicemen and are accustomed to military life tensions still run high in such a feminine outpost lt col roy c prince social worker for the community has the job of easing these tensions reluctantly he comments we find our most prevalent problem is a lack of discipline among the women with respect to the children also neighborhood arguments do spring up among the wives theres an awful lot of cliques here and there are arguments sometimes because of cultural differences i find that most of our negro wives tend to stay together and we have many foreignbom wives who also more or less keep to themselves some people dislike the manor but very few actually move out because they will only stay for one year while their husband is on his tour most of our wivts settle down play a great deal of cards and drink a lot of coffee prince has divided the manor into neighborhood divisions each with a chairman to help work out the areas problems he meets with these chairmen every two weeks for discussions and to settle disputes with neighborhood antagonists lie claims that the ladies enjoy a good reputation in the salina area and that there are few illicit romances i keep a close check with the civilian community to find out if there is any infidelity going on but so far we havent had much of this iiowecr i will say when a man comes back on rotation he is in great demand in the communitv because the women like to have him fix their childrens tovs and so forth among the gis at ft riley waiting wives hold a different reputation when they say the hawk is out they mean theres a man around who makes it a practice to kep lonely women company they say there are lots of hawks and lots of lonely women the wives grow to be very independent after their husbands leave says lt col prince they icani to fulfill both the feminine and masculine role for their children when their husbands come back there is often a great marriage readjustment some make it some dont i would i call this community a successful endeavor but its not for everyone for those women whose husbands are not career men and who i t was years ago that the famous son of alois hitler nee shicklgruber was declared dead a suicide with his nordic bride eva in the chancellery at besieged berlin and while no aiitlioritatix e evidence yet has been presented to proc adolf hitlers death the world nevertheless breathes easier it was generally assumed that with the fall of the tliird reich the power which had unleashed upon the world the most heinous racism of modem times had been crushed more than inferior people had been put to death wellmeaning americans reeling from the shock of this massive genocide and the recognition that the nazis miht have won the war sighed in relief bmshed aside the implications of hiroshima and whispered to each other it cant happen here but of course it can for more llian years a nativebred jhilosophy not very different from ilerr hitlers has been preached in this country with the upwaid thrust of the civil_rights movement this racist philosophy gains more strident voices and these enemies of humanity are aided perhaps unwittingly by those whites who admonish negro citizens to go slow and to be more responsible in the push for full and equal rights as if negroes have not gone slowly for a cenhuy and as if it is not precisely white americas disdain of its responsibility which has brought the nation to this terrible moment for the dilemma should be seen now clearly either negroes will be free or else those who oppose their freedom will have no alternative but to reenslave them the enemies of negro rights are both numerous and powerful and many of them hear the cadences of herr schicklgrubers marching spirit and are hypnotized do not look fonvard to an army life the vietnam war is a different story most of these wives cannot live in the neat houses of schilling manor but had to find places in junction city outside of ft riley carrie harcv was married onlv two months before her hus m band left for vietnam several months later she was a widow her hiksband pfc charles harvev wanted her to buv a house if he died but she never got any money from his sioooo insurance policy because he had made it out in his sisters name now mrs harv ey lives in the black section of junction city while she ponders what to do with her life two of carries friends who live in her neighborhood are also voung widows like her they seem bored empty and lonely adriane conners is and she is the mother of a small child she was a bride of three months when her husband ssgt jerome conners left he didnt want to go she remembers when he sent me tapes from vietnam could hear all the guns and the artillery his letters didnt reflect what he was really likeit sems like someone was pressuring the men to write different than thev reallv felt m m cyanbalene ingram adds i dont see what were doing over there in vietnam vmicii i see these young guys and years old getting drafted and going over there i feel bad i dont vvant any of my kids to go into the vrmythese war protestors are right we have a lot more work to do here in our own country cyanbalene has three children the youngest barely seven months old her husband was study ing for his music degree when he was drafted and sent to vietnam where he died like most of the otlur y oung vvomen carrie adriane and cymbalene while away the long hours with talk and bingo and sometimes a visit to night spots catering to military personnel they meet other gls of course but all three claim thev would never marrv another military man sometimes thev talk about moving awav from central kansas and starting a new life but adriane and cymbalene grew up right in junction city its the only place theyve ver known even though records show that there are proportionately higher numbers of negro soldiers fighting and dying in vietnam few of the wives at ft riley and schilling manor and junction city share the bitterness of carrie and adriane and cvmbalene most of the wives are already in the moldthey know whats expected of them as army wives they try not to voice their unhappiness as for the negro wiv es says one chaplain i get very few help calls from them perhaps its because so many have religious faith and perhaps this faith helps them ov er thiir despondency but another chaplain remarks after spending all night comforting a hysterical woman who received that dreaded telegram served in the korean conflict i dont know which is harder dulykorea or right here in central kansas t he place is in paris so its menu just has to list a couple of pates and a few wines such as nuus st georges and rose da provene but whats really happening at restaurant haynes which is in montmartre just down the hill from pigalle has to do with such things as chitterlings and fried chicken pig feet and turni greens and that other down home delightcracklin bread restaurant haynes is where parisians think its ties chic to down a platter of nourriliirc de tame soul food these days and theyve just about replaccd the american gis and black musicians who kept chef leroy rough house haynes in business for years after he dropped his first piece of chicken into a skillet in paris back in along with the french customers there are such people as richard burton and elizabeth taylor who celebrated her feb birthday there last year with quarts of jack daniels sour mash whiskey and fried chicken sprinkled with garlic salt peter otoole who goes wild over ehili and red beans brigitte bardot a fork full of chitterlings and lots of lemon meringue pie and jackie gleason who gave haynes a handlettered diploma for feeding him and a group of friends so well lately lots of flower children hae been coming oer from london to seek the meaning of life while communing with a bowl of smoked ham hocks and blackeyed peas all those people says haynes who earned the nickname rough house years ago as an allamerican end on the morehouse college football team you know i suppose they find it kind of hard to stay away from a place where everythings cooked with a little bacon grease here a little garlic there and with lots and lots of love h aynes settled ill paris after mustering out of the army in europe in the s lie already had a masters degree in sociology from atlanta university so he thought hed use his gi bill to study for a doctorate at the sorbonne after a long involvement with studies and theses and such things as latin quarter intellectiialisin and author richard wrights old fraiicoamcrican fellowship he pulled back from perhaps a futile effort to become real brilliant and began looking around for ways to set himself up in business in france he ran across a young frenchman who wanted to get rid of a bistro he had inherited on the little rue manuel haynes sold his dodge to a gi for then peddled the american dollars on the paris black market and raiscd bundles of french francs he bought the bistro and called it gahhv and havnes gahbv was gahriclle lecarbonnier a hea yliipped french girl whom haynes married he admits because a foreigner had to have a french partner in order to do business in france what gabby and haynes served was soul food and in time american gis and the entertainment set made it one of the most famous eating spots in the gourmet capital of the world entertainers photos covered the walls menus were signed by people ranging from louis armstrong to james baldwin to jcanpaul belmondo the french star blit after a son and piitc a few spats gabby and haynes went separate ways she still operates the old restaurant haynes new and much bigger place is around the corner on the rue claiizel with another french wife and two small daughters he lives just a few doors from liis restaurant havnes haynes who became a naturalized french citizen in has rooted himself in france im french now he says and theres nothing more hack in the states for me all my friends are here my business is hereeverything he renounced his american citizenship he says for no other reason than that i intended to stay here and operate a business and its easier to do that when youre a citizen of france haynes has been back in the u s only once in more than years and that was a year or so ago when he spent two weeks in new york making one of the frenchproduced films in which he has appeared een those two weeks were too much for me he says you see once you get yourself tuned to europe there arc certain things about the united states that are pretty hard to stand theres a certain sociological sound hack there my cars are no longer accustomed to it theyll neer be able to readjust the soundits too highpitched disturbs me too much like ou know that sound which humans cant hear hut which can dris c dogs mad what haynes is talking alxnit of course is the unsettling sound of racism in the states escaping from it running away from the fight the brother is in i dont look at it that way he says a man makes choicesabout the woman he marries about a name for his child about where he can make a home i choose never to live in the states again i choose europe not because i hate the us not because its all had and over here is all good didnt some fellow once say it isnt that i love caesar less i just lo c rome more s o long as the warp and woof of the cultural fabric of this nation does not change the future for the youngster on the opposite page is black indeed the adjective black is used here in its usual english definition with the many evil connotations it brings to the minds of all whites and many negroes growing up in rural mississippi he is starting at the very bottom with about every handicap any ablebodied americanborn citizen could be burdened with in an era when men literally have their sights set on the moon he may possibly never travel any further than the nearest tiny town and his life work might be wasted in a nearby cotton field or sawmill while this youngster happens to be from the rural south his counterpart can be found in the slums of the north from new york to los angeles in the deprived areas of prosperous southern cities like atlanta and in the meatpacking towns of waterloo and sioux city iowa so long as there is no change life may well become an eternity of endless dmdgery for children such as these but changes must be made ut changes must be made in the complex modern society of today children are the raw material from which is moulded the responsible adults for the even more complex society of tomorrow outworn mores and folkways useless traditions ancient hates and stubborn resistance to change must be done away with before the population of this nation can socially and culturally begin to catch up with its technology and they must be done away with now time is growing short dont wait for the white man iie past decade has shown that the negro in america cannot wait for the white man to solve his problems for him the white man who can build an atom bomb and put men in huge capsules in orbit around the earth has been proven woefully ignorant in such human endeavors as integrating schools desegregating housing and giving guidance and hope even to white youngsters this means that if black youngsters are to be prepared for life in the tomorrow it is the black adult who is going to have to see that the task is accomplished for years a few dedicated white liberals have tried ineffectively to bring about reform for years a larger group of vicious reactionary whites have used every force in their power to stifle any change for years the majority of whites in this country have remained aloof coming in personal contact with no negroes at all and completely unconcerned about what happened to their black fellow citizen it is obvious that with such a division the negro cannot expect any really radical changes to be made in american culture todayunless the negro makes them can the tail wag the dog nut how and the question is a logical one can million d negroes change the culture of a nation of more than million people can the tail wag the dog strangely the answer in this case is yes in fact it is already happening the most important step has been taken already by the majority of negroes who have developed their black consciousnessat least enough to be able to recognize that they are black and that no matter what their station in life whites think of them as black they may still cringe at the sound of the phrase black_power but they do not deny their blackness it is this black consciousness that enabled them to elect mayors in gary ind and cleveland it is this black consciousness that made it possible for negroes to establish successful banks in new york chicago and many other cities through out the country and it is the realization that this black consciousness exists that has led many city governments to make concessions to negroes that ten years ago would not have been made through unity comes power a s negroes in america become more unified more willing to work together they will become more powerful regardless of how limited this democracy may be it still allows the vote to millions of negroes properly used that vote could eventually give the black man a sizeable voice in the federal goveniment with cities such as chicago sending at least four black representatives to congress properly used this vote could take as many as per cent of the council seats in major cities and no matter how much we may joke about politicians in this country the fact remains that politically elected bodies have tremendous power and that power can be shared by black men and then there is green power he negro in america spends some billion every year and lets face it that much money can be used to exert power for change billion could provide a good leverage when spent judiciouslywhere it will do the most good for negroes as a whole it could also provide enough support to blackowned businesses to encourage more negroes to go into business on a national scale negro owned factories contributing to the gross national product of this nation would change a lot of folks attitudes toward the negro today he who helps the poor he negro today can help change the culture of this nation today by politically supporting the man who has the best program for helping the poor the u s is the richest nation in the world but at the same time it boasts some million people who according to government standards are poor obviously the majority of these poor are white although percentagewise there are more poor negroes than poor whites poor whites outnumber poor negroes but the federal and state governments cannot inaugurate programs to help the poor whites without at the same time helping poor negroes president franklin d roosevelt proved this during the depression years of the s when he became a hero to negroes who found themselves benefiting from poverty programs such as the wpa which were designed primarily to help the liavenot whites in this country it boils down to the fact that he who helps the poor helps the negro a bright black future f the united states is going to change soon enough to help the tot on the opposite page and the hundreds of thousands like him throughout the country the negro is going to have to take the initiative in speeding that change he is going to have to take it first in expanding his black consciousness and unifying his efforts he is going to have to take it by using his vote where it will do him the most good just as other ethnic groups have done before him he is going to have to do it by spending his money where possible in ways that will help businesses which give him a fair shake and will help black businesses flourish hes going to have to do what he can to help the havenots both white and black once he does all these things then the boy on the opposite page can look forward to a bright

of beautiful black people the warmest most human in the world in the spring the land around the locations restricted areas outside johannesburg where black people are forced to live turns a fresh green and johannesburg itself is so beautiful it almost takes your breath away yes south africa is my country but it is also my hell for the first years of my life i was one of the isla million black people who live or should i say exist under a system that takes away all of their rights as human beings and uses them as things to do the menial labor for some sla million whites who control the goxernnient the economy the army and the police of the fifth richest nation in the world how can million people control million i am frequently asked as i travel in the us todav it seems incredible to an outsider but it is a fact i have alreadv said that the black people are warm and human they are also unarmed impoverished and divided for years they fixed in hope that through nonviolent protest and legislation they could win the rights they had been so long denied by the time black leaders realized that the warmth and hiimanitv thev took for granted because thev had so much did not fie within the hearts of the whites it was too late unarmed and helpless they could look to the sharix ille massacre as an examjde of the violence of which the white man was capable i grew up in a family that had learned to accommodate to the system my late father hated the system but my mother kept the family in fine and she sacrificed to help my three sisters my brother and me gain as much education as possible she could never understand it when i quit school in rather than go along with the bantu education for servitude which had become more strict than before i found work in johannesburg as a trainee with zonk one of the magazines published by whites for black south africans and continued my high school work through a correspondence course since i fix ed in a toxvnship some hours train ride from the city i had plenty of time to prepare my school xvork i was already interested in photography and xvhen i later moved on to drum another magazine this interest xvas given a boost by the photo editor jurgen schraderberg xvho let me xvork as a darkroom technician he was one of the pioneers in mm and ax ailable fight photography in south africa and he helped me develop into a perfectionist both with the camera and in the darkroom as i got better and better xxnth the camera i decided to make photojournalism my fife xvork i felt that through iny pictures i could lift the curtain hiding what life xvas really like for the black man under the xvhite racist regime my discontent with the ircatlv as i worked daily in the citv where no black man is allowed to lie except as a servant in the house of his white master all blacks had to cany passes and i could be thnwvn into jail and fined merely for leaini my pass at home black policemen enforced the white mans laws and black informers made a fix ing squealing on other black men who showd signs of stepping out of fine the whole system based on white supremacy taught me to hate to steal and to fie looking back on it now it seems that almost had to be in a trance to exist within the system i had to five as if it were a sin to be black in a country where more than per cent of the population wms black i learned to hate and distrust the white man i felt that could kill that i could be as inhuman as the wiiite man seemed to think i was then in something happened that shaped my purpose in fife i w as gi en a book

program last june was asked if he felt his appointment was a tremendous step forward in race relations this is nothing dramatic its just a normal progression said the unassuming young officer ive been very fortunate the crash of his fid starfighter jet on a nmway in a california desert six months later was to be sure a dramatic ending to his brief life fate had interrupted a progression that was viewed by most of lawrence s countrymen black or white as other than normal inteiidrctcd within the large context of american history the appointment necessarily placed the name of robert lawrence alongside jackie robinson james meredith thurgood marshall and other firsts mrs gwendolyn duncan the astronauts mother called her son a pioneer lawrence though he indicated hope that his achievement might motivate other negroes met the cerimuony that came with such a role with some reluctance doubtless he was not unmindful of the context in which the nation viewed his appointment however there is reason to believe that the man who dreamed of becoming the first of his race to explore space interpreted the event within a smaller but no less significant context the experiences of his lifetime for it is his background that provides a frame of reference for robert lawrences normal progression astronaut lawrence was born into a relatively poor chicago family october belonging to a small and rather unicpie group of black people to whom the american dream had become more than an abstraction he was not in his formative years the child of any one class a chicago reporter who was a childhood friend of lawrences betty washington remembers him spinning around the corner on a homemade wooden scooter a trademark of poor black city boys in the s but she also recalls from the same years listening to bobby lawrences piano renditions of bachmaninolf classics mrs washington and lawrence lived in the same building in the good neighbor apartments at rd and south slate st today the scene of a housing project we thought it was a slum then says mrs washington but she allows that it did not compare with slums she has since come upon extreme poverty the kind that has crippled millions of black children in this land was not the plight of robert and his sister barbara who is on the staff of the national scholarship service and fund for negro students their parents were divorced when they were preschool age but their stepfather charles duncan was always steadily employed first as an underwriter for the veterans administration and then in the circulation departments of various periodicals mrs duncan has for some years been a civil servant lawrences stepfather whose marriage to mrs duncan ended after the children were grown believes that the boys being surrounded by love was instrumental in his early development he had the love of his mother a wonderfid woman and his sister and i loved him dearly said duncan mrs duncan who graciously reveals extreme pride when speaking of her son credits his early christian science training with helping to shape lawrences character this may sound unbelievable but i dont know of any occasion when had to discipline cither of my children says mrs duncan they had a discipline that must have come from within a story his mother tells centered around the piano perhaps says more about robert lavvtcnce as a lad than does his mastery of rach maninoff tlie family piano had been purchased on a plan that allowed for ei kilt lessons at a special reduced rate i emphasized to bob the importance of his making all the lessons recalled mrs duncan heading downtown for his lesson one afternoon robert was struck and knocked to the street by a truck getting up and brushing liimself off young robert rejected the truck drivers attempt to take him to a hospital insisting that he could not miss his piano lesson while yet in elementary school lawrence became a model airplane hobbyist and an ardent chess enthusiast disciplined studious the atypical urban ghetto ynnngsttt who easily obtained suburban habits he was at the same time an acti e kid who plaved in the sandlots with the neighborhood boys and was not beyond indulging in the pranks of the day betty wishington has not forgotten bobjnnior as his playmates called him all in one breath snatching chunks of ice that the old man driving the ice truck would lta i for the children to steal which seems in keeping with the way rtbert h lawrence sr a disabled veteran sums up his sons preadolescent years he was scholarly and serious s a small boy the expression on his face reilected a kind of dedication but i didnt consider him a precocious child official air force representative at funeral was maj gen jusepli bleymaier sliowii entering church as honor guard snaps to attention he is a director of mol program to whicli lawrence was appointed other highranking officers attended rites lawrences interest in science emerged early an attraction his mother is unable to explain except to say that her son always had a questioning mind she recalls that each christmas he wanted a bigger and better chemistry set at the age of lawrence was enrolled in englewood high school the same school his parents had attended s a young high school student he was first fascinated by biology we always had a house full of hamsters in those days smiles mrs duncan the hamsters were given biblical names by their young guardian lawrences mother and sister laughingly speak of a day when much to the familys surprise he did not arrive home from school at the expected hour a hamster in the school lab had bitten someone and the police had confiscated all of the schools hamsters for delivery to the health authorities on his way home from school lawrence visited the police station bob wouldnt come home until the hamsters were rescued reports barbara and he did rescue them englewood today beset with all the familiar woes of overcrowded ghetto schools including a chop out rate of about per cent was for lawrence the place where an aptitude for science was nurtured en route to his becoming an astronaut the black boys who entered englewood with lawrence in were more likely to receive an education than those entering the same school today current assumptions of negro progress notwithstanding it was then a predominantly negro school but not without its very own distinction englewood was in a sense the public school that was somehow private englewoods black students came mostly from the woodlawn area where resided most of the families who had begun claiming portions of the dream made a ailable by postwar tokenism but others like lawrences family easily found their way around the neighborhood school concept they sent their children past any number of public high schools to the school w here as barbara lawrence puts it there was a different kind of negro in those years we were well vve were the strivers a better label cannot be found for those young blacks who in those premovement years invested both soul and psyche in the battle to outdo the white man at the white mans game they did so with a great deal of pride and in wliat they considered to be the best interest of the race and not without notable results as was in evidence in the person of fellow strivers at the chicago funeral for major lawrence they were engineers educators chemists executives from both go ernment and pri ate industrall buddies of lawrence from the englewood years and though their deceased friend had gained national prominence they too had progressed in a way that he would hae considerd nonnal gien ins particular frame of reference for not unlike the astronaut tliey had worked hard had overcome certain obstacles and in the same sense that lawrence recognized concerning hiinsilf een verv fortunate after graduation from englewood in the upper per cent of his class lawrence who excelled in chemistry and as a track man in the and scso entered bradley uniersity there the discipline of a lifetime was conducive to his adv ancement in the air force reserve officers training coqs to the rank of lieutenant colonel making him the second highest ranking cadet at the school former bradley basketball star curley johnson a chicagoan who now is a parole agent for the illinois youth commission remembers his platoon leader well he was brilliant a very conscientious guy and he was military minded and verv verv strict while at bradley lawrence worked at parttime jobs around the peoria ill campus and also started dating his wife barbara the daughter of dr and mrs henrv cress of chicago he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the ll s air force in march just after he received his bachelors degree in chemistry lawrences air force career commenced with basic and adv anced training as a pilot and according to those vvlio knew him best like longtime luddy sam hurley a civil engineer in chicago he loved flying with a passion flving was his heart savs lawrence sr the astronauts father also mentions that this son drov e his porsche at a pretty good clip an aside not in tlie least unusual among aircraft pilots once when he was home on leav e we were driv ing down the expressvvay and told him man youre flying too low recalls the proud father he laughed he was a boat load of fun i didnt see him that often but when we were together we alvvavs had a ball in late lawrence was assigned to an air base in germany as an instructor pilot when his fiancees father asked her what she wanted as a gift vv hen she took her ba in psychology in she replieda trip to germany there on july the couple was married and also it is the birthplace of their eightyearold son tracev lawrence returned to the states the summer of and through the air force institute of technologv entered ohio state univ ersitv as a doctoral candidate in physical science his widow who insists upon remembering her late husband as a human being he was not a little god says that he would have been the first to admit that prior to his senior year at bradlev his college grades were rather undistinguished not so at ohio state there his grade point average was higher than out of a possible his transcript revealing one c four bs and an imposing number of a sincluding a s in such challenging courses as nuclear chemistry photochemistry chemical kinetics advanced inorganic cliemistry and thermodynamics he was as friend milton johnson points out so heavy however sam hurley observes that lawrence wasnt satisfied to simply make it on his natural ability he was confident that he could achieve something if he worked hardand he worked hard he wasnt pushv he didnt talk about himself much but bob knew that if he did something well it would not go unrecognized and when recognition came lawrence though pleased felt that he was receiving undue or premature attention his mother allows that he believed his three comrades who were appointed to the mol program along with him maj james a abrahamson maj donald h peterson and lt col robert t herres deserved as much attention it is for such thoughtfulness as much as brainpower that his friends remember him the vearoid widow who has returned to her native chicago to rear her son takes great pride in showing a number of unmailed letters he had written in answer to letters received from young children one such letter was written to a third grade student at haines elementary school in chicago from which lawrence graduated in in much the same way he might have counseled his own son lawrence advised wisdom success and educational achievement are not always the same heres hoping you will attain them all the astronauts sisterinlaw lome cress a former sncc worker in mississippi while confiding that her brotherinlaw was not revolutionary in a political sense nevertheless notes how genuine was his concern for black youth he was not insensitive to certain growing criticism of the black mans role in the armed forces and the space program but he sincerely believed it imperative that black people keep pace in the often overlooked area of the sciences his family has established the robert h lawrence jr memorial scholarship fund for negro chemistry students at bradley university lawrence was as high school friend mrs sunni evans recalls extremely serious about life before science commanded so much of his time he was ejuite a student of philosophy act as research chemist gale occomy observes about the guy he ran with in those teenage years he was always able to see the humor in life he was able to enjoy for example the humor in rap brovvms alleged quip about america making a black astronaut just so s they can lose that nigger in space his sister shys away from the adjective competitive in describing her brother but the evidence nonetheless suggests that lawrence was never one with an aversion to entering the arena and he had a way of emerging the wellliked victor it is believed that major lawrence save for his untimely death would have entered still another aicna space he once said that if men were going to explore space he wanted to be one of them he was in the final two weeks of training in the mol program when his illfated starfighter making a complicated simulated spaceship landing carried him to his deatli the arena he had not time enough to enter he opened and had he realized such an irnaginativ e pursuit doubtless he would have willed that it be shared in much the same spirit with which he dedicated his complex page doctoral dissertation upon taking his phd in iiis work is dedicated to those american who have spent their lives in the performance of menial tasks struggling to overcome both natural and manmade problems of survival to such men ami women scientific investigation would seem a grand abstraction however it has been their endeavors which have supplied both the wherewithal and motivation that initiated and helped sustain this effort maj robert h lawrence became a hero in the american tradition and in doing so he proved finally what black people in this country have long knownthat excellence has no color for young black boys like his own son should they seek to be heroes in the traditional manner or heroes of another kind it is tlie legacy one courageous black man left them f or years tennesseeborn social worker anne pinkston nursed lu r dream of one day establishing a place where young people could come to satisfy their cra ing for creative expression today lliat dream is a reality in the form of the waltann school of creative arts a modest threestory building in brooklyn n y dedicated to sparking the creative talents of neighborhood youths waltann takes its name from a merger of mrs pinkstons first name with that of her husband walter it was established eight years ago with eight students and mrs pinkstons belief that creatix ity is not the exclusive possession of a genius now waltann bustles nearly k students explore the joys of dance drama music and art some study foreign languagesfrench italian and spanish most are negro youngsters from lowincome families but there are some whites too and a few adults c ultural pursuits at waltann are combined with efiforts to meet the pressing social responsibilities of life in a black brooklyn community the facility functioning like a settlement house houses classrooms for preschoolers enrolled in head start its auditorium is offered to the community for weddings receptions and other events an afterschool program is designed for teens and provides supervised recreation and more sobering homework sessions tuition costs are flexible depending on the students ability to pay and friends of waltann a volunteer group which last year skimmed in benefit concerts helps to offset financial deficits wc have four objectives says mrs pinkston to provide a creative outlet through which individuals can discover their abilities to guide and direct those who want careers in the arts to offer our communitv access to reasonably priced cultural performances and to showcase our student talent mildspoken but firmly in control of waltanns member staff mrs pinkston has strong opinions concerning the shortage of tndy out j standing negro artists in the classical arts so many of our youngsters have been told there is no placc for them in the top fields a situation which she feels is fast improving though waltann cannot yet boast of having produced a singer of the caliber of a leontyne price the school has made important strides in that direction three of its alumni now attend the toughtoenter high school of performing arts in new york city one is enrolled in manhattans high school of music and arts and one is a student at the juilliard school of music waltanns administrators work to motivate and better equip exceptional students with skills that will gain them entry into these specialized institutions where talented amateurs arc refined and polished into becoming skilled professionals additional boosting is available to waltann students at annual career clinics where prominent performers like frederick oneal lilia skala ossie davis and ruby dee counsel them face to face an appreciative

by a member advisory board led by singer merrit a hedgeman but for waltannites the real excitement happens in the schools modest auditorium long hours of practice and rehearsal pay off grandly for

please the troops and in competing with each other they generally come up w ith something better or cheaper or else yet strangely enough there are well meaning people in this country today who just dont see it that way they think mrs omara is confused by too much choice in the marketplace or maybe just not bright enough to choose among all those different cake mixes or different kinds of cars reduce the choice they say wouldnt four kinds of cake mix be enough standardize the products that w ill make shopping a lot quicker and easier for everybody the trouble is w ho sets the standards not

footwear i n a period when the black man in america is desperately searching his roots down through slavery to the wellspring of africa there is one area that has been almost totally ignoredthe history of the black visual artist on american soil that there is such a history was dramatically proved in the exhibit the evolution of afroamerican artists shown in the great hall of ccny last fall sponsored by the city university of new york in cooperation with the harlem cultural council and the new york urban league the exhibit was a tremendous success more than visitors many of them harlem schoolchildren viewed the works selected from the paintings and sculptures of artists ranging from joshua johnston who lived at the time of the american revolution down to merton d simpson who first reached artistic prominence in at age a t the entrance to the exhibit the evolution of afroamerican artists codirectors romare bearden and carroll greene jr positioned six works of african art with one bronze cock dating back to the benin kingdom to in what is now nigeria the section was designed to give viewers a taste of the african heritage of negro american artists that african heritage had little influence on the early work of afroamerican artists if the samples of work shown from the late th and early th centuries are any guide of the known black artists who painted in that period all worked in the conventional styles of the day and amazed critics because despite the fact that they were black they coidd paint with the same quality as white artists the first black artists mentioned before the revolution was one scipio morehead whose work won him a poem of tribute from phyllis wheatley a black poet who astonished the white world with her classical handling of poetry none of morcheads work is known to be in existence today but the show did display three romantic portraits by joshua johnston a baltimore negro who lived from around to around prosperous baltimore families commissioned johnston to do portraits though after his death many of the portraits were credited to other artists louring the isoos landscape artists robert s duncanson edward m bannister and henry o tanner who lived until won tremendous fame they were awarded prizes both in the u s and europe and their paintings were purchased by art museums as well as private collectors edinonia lewis the first negro american sculptress was famous by the time she was in her early s she went to rome and lived among american expatriate artists until her death in during the early th century there seems to have been a lull in the progress of afroamerican artists until the s when an intellectual renaissance swept across a crassly materialistic america negro artists writers poets and musicians blossomed rapidly and most journeyed to new york where harlem became the center of the negro renaissance this was the period of the emergence of such noted negro artists as hale woodruff sculptor meta warwick fuller aaron douglas palmer hayden sculptor richmond barthe archibald motley and james porterall of whom were in the exhibit after the renaissance a new group of artists emerged during the depression years of the s out of this group came hughie leesmith jacob lawrence romare bearden and charles white

are gone and buried and the theory that the white man is endowed by his creator u ith certain inalienable rights over black men is extinct now almost all the african and asian nations are independent and also j havc a say in world affairs not to mention that they also participate and contribute to this great sjort of boxing i conclude by saying that x e out here in africa and asia still regard

co i t was years ago that the famous son of alois llitler nee shicklgruber was declared dead a suicide with his nordic bride eva in the chancellery at besieged berlin and while no authoritative evidence yet has been presented to prove adolf hitlers death the world nevertheless breathes easier it was generally assumed that with the fall of the third reich the power which had unleashed upon the world the most heinous racism of modern times had been crushed more than inferior people had been put to death wellmeaning americans reeling from the shock of this massive genocide and the recognition that the nazis might have won the war sighed in rehef brushed aside the imphcations of hiroshima and whispered to each other it cant happen here but of course it can for more than years a nativebred philosophy not very different from herr hitlers has been preached in this country with the upward thrust of the civil_rights movement this racist philosophy gains more strident voices and these enemies of humanity are aided perhaps unwittingly by those whites who admonish negro citizens to go slow and to be more responsible in the push for full and equal rights as if negroes have not gone slowly for a century and as if it is not precisely white americas disdain of its responsibility which has brought the nation to this terrible moment for the dilemma should be seen now clearly either negroes will be free or else those who oppose their freedom will have no alternative but to reenslave them the enemies of negro rights are both numerous and powerful and many of them hear the

about it theres tension things are happening you feel messengers dart in and out a phone rings and a secretarys likelv to sav yes hes readv for that white house call occasionally the mayor rushes off somewhere in a black lincoln thats chauffeured by a cop in plainclothes unkind people say hes gone off to the union club or out in summit county to rich cyrus eatons acadia farms to see whats to be done next week nonsense the union clubs bearded old white power structure had nothing to do with getting him into the mayors chair cyrus eaton gave some money to the campaign thats all ctually not

turn stokes wav so the first black bigcitv mavor doesnt owe the establishment or labor or the party bosses anything he made it without strings what got him into office was that on election dav last november whole flocks of black people swamped the polls and pulled a real first big black_power political coup tliey hit the streets in the snow then waited in lines sometimes an hour or more to drop votes for soul brother carl whole flocks of white people tried something similar for their man seth taft but black_power with some pretty good help from whites who rallied to the cause came out ahead now that hes in stokes is hustling hard he has to the spotlight has shifted from the novelty of him out on a west side garden patio stumping for a crucial few irish and slovenian votes to the serious

garys year history these youngsters and others like them had been among the few bright spots in a gruelling month political psvchological and pb ysical ordeal for the yearold bachelor they had somebody to identify with he said later they never had this before they were as inspired as his campaign had been a campaign whose final hours would reveal he had gallantly fought and defeated a strong republican candidate a democratic organization that simply refused him financial or political support voting lists fraudulently stacked against him leaflets distributed that hinted he was a communist and the tradition that no negro had ever been elected mayor of a large american city in the may democratic primar hatcher had upset incumbent mayor a martin katz and become the first negro to win a mayoral lrimary for either party in indiana he had campaigned well impressing both whites and negroes with his intelligence and broad grasp of municipal affairs he had come before them a

tocher insisted that the bunnies ought to wear skirts and blouses giv e stokes another month or two theyre saying around city hall and hes going to have this town turning round to do it stokes has some trumps in hand the big businessmen are backing him his business brain trust includes such men as george herzog vvho is former chairman of the union commerce bank and a director of corporations

support giv en as a legislator to republicansponsored bills as for popular backing cleveland negroes are naturally enthusiastic about things at city hall these days and vvlites have accepted their black mayor with not a single rock thrown thats cleveland for von savs call post publisher william o walker weve had our riots and we still have more problems than we need but basicallv racial attitudes here arent as hard as in other towns walker saws thats because cleveland was settled back in the itoos bv new englanders moving westward into the connecticut tand cos vast western reserve these people were abolitionists he says and some of their liberal thinking has filtered up through each generation that has evolved here cleveland was indeed considered a good town for negroes for dozens of years thus they flocked there by the tens of thousands early in life not so much with his fists as with his brain a dishwasher at age his sense of decency was outraged by a white employer who refused to serve negroes hatcher quit in disgust then mustered sev eral friends to stage the towns first sitin povertv was second nature to him but his skill as a ard sprinter and high jumper earned him a track scholarship at indiana university where he studied economics and govemment and developed impressive public speaking skills to earn a law degree from valparaiso university in with honors in criminal law hatcher attended classes from to and worked in a hospital from to midnight the following year he came to gary brimming with ambition idealism and hope the democratic machine had things locked up he recalls you couldnt run for office without its blessing a group of us in the negro community formed a club which became the core of my campaign today it was called the muigwithania that was the name of jorno kenyattas underground nevvspaper in the man mau uprising although the brilliant law graduate served as deputy prosecutor in the lake county criminal court he did not gain public prominence until when he ran as a democratic candidate independent of the city machine and tallied the largest vote ev er amassed for councihnanatlargc within a year hatcher became council president both the youngest and first freshman councilman to do so he soon founded a freedom movement to generate support for an open occupancy ordinance passed in and presently being tested in the courts in time he developed an extensive knowledge of other urban problems like air pollution taxes housing etc the knowledge was to prov e indispensable in his mayoral campaign with his detailed verbal summaries of urban facts and figures he could fend off critics who said he was not qualified to run the city because he had not lived there long enough only sev en years and he was too young my answer on both counts he often quipped is that i got here as fast as i could during the spring primary hatcher turned down xkk offered to him to drop from the race grimy corrupt gangstercontrolled gary needed a radical change and he was determined to help bring it alxmt the incumbent mayor katz had failed to carry a single white precinct vvhen he was elected in moving into city hall on the strength of votes from local negroes in his drive for continued negro support katz chose a negro campaign manager lake county coroner dr a s williams and a negro speechwriter chuck stone former aide to adam clayton powell while admitting katz had been probably more fair to negroes than any predecessor hatcher criticized the mayors failure to consider qualified negroes for top jobs in the police fire and health departments in one of his primary campaign speeches hatcher charged nothing had changed in the last three and a half years under katz i ask you are the slums any prettier are our schools any less crowded have they built one single public housing unit have they torn dowai one single building for urban renewal have they expanded the park system have they desegregated the schools katz answered that hatcher was a radical extremist and advocate of black_power he warned voters that garys record of freedom from major racial violence vvould end with his opponents election so newsmen who pestered hatcher about the charges wanted to know what about black_power if you mean burning dowm buildings and getting rifles to liberate ourselves im not in that category hatcher explained i favor pexfling resources to improv e the conditions of persons of color i dont believe in separatism he managed to defeat katz mainly because votes had been siphoned off by a segregationist candidate hatcher polled votesfewer than of them whiteto katz it was a stun on their postwar trek to the north but flocking there too were hill country whites anti immigrants from the captive nations of eastern europe each group settled its own areasnegroes on the east side hillbillies on the near west side and the immigrants in little europes all over town cleveland today has perhaps the most rigid neighborhood segregation of any american town with this has come all the usual urban ills segregated housing inferior schools unemployment poor health servicesfrom all of which negroes who make up per cent of the population have gotten the worst deals s successive administrations failed to cope with the problems the once best location in the nation became for negroes the mistake on the lake it began early in the idea that a black man could be mayor of the natiojis tenth largest town people talked about it over lunch at the lancer restaurant which is on carnegie avenue across the street from a big rat exterminating company and which is run by a negro who has his waiters in red jackets and who likes for men to wear ties when thev come there to dine somebodv mentinned that clev eland was in a mess those days that under locher it was slow ly dying old industry was moving out few new plants were coming in unemployment was soaring welfare funds were low people were getting restlessespecially the black people who were getting the worst deals of all somebody complained that mayor locher a romanian was trying too hard to please the smallminded peasantclass eastern european immigrants who had segregated themselves inside old world enclaves and made cleveland an uniquely balkanized town the mayor everyone agreed had stopped listening to negro complaints some church pastors who had tried to force talks with him were arrested and jailed its time somebody said for us to put a black man in city ilall so there over lunches at the lancer names were tossed around among them leo jackson lawyer and th ward councilman clarence holmes lawyer and president of the cleveland branch naacp and carl b stokes lawyer and state representative jackson some people thought was honest and all that but too excitable and too much of a footinthemouth man holmes rated very high but hed need white v oters to win and theyd nev er forget his naacp career stokes seemed to be the right man he had lots of things going for him smooth nice smile no grinning just a smile good education west irginia state college western reserve university universitv of minnesota clevelandmarshall law school traveled in europe fine speaker pretty wife cute kids not too radical so enough white voters could be brought along a little fat at the middle and up around the jowls but for tv exercise and dieting would trim him down hed be o k with the brothers because he had come out of the central area ghetto out of a home where the father jiacl died where the mother had worked as a domestic for ricli white folks and where welfare handouts had made the meals lots of brothers knew all about such things the idea was that at carl burton stokes ought to go after the biggest political job in town stokes was drafted and in three weeks time people had signed nominating jxtitions to get him in the race if he could make it hed shatter lots of white folks myths hed fulfill lots of black folks dreams but things ganged up on stokes in not enough negros were registered to vote almost to a man the nine negro city councilmen decided he didnt ha e a chance against mayor locher so they clung to whatever pull they had at city hall they held back their support so did labor and the plain dealer and the press the county dcmocrats handed their endorsement to locher though hed already sered two citykilling terms stokes lost that time aroundby just votes the dreams had to be deferred but stokes campaign manager dr kenneth w clement could sav last november when all the votes were in was more than just a loss it was well a necessary step toward conditioning this town toward winning this time to help stokes win this time clev eland negroes mounted wdiat may become a textbook example of what black powxt may well ought to be about black people seeing a chance moving in on it supporting and controlling it all the way and being smart enough to get whatev er help is needed to work every detail to their own ends cleveland in became a city on fire with blackbloc politicking with black solidarity and pride black people who knew the meaning of the phrase began talking about black consciousness those who didnt know it put it as best they could lets start acting like what we is ghetto negro and middleclass negro began incxting in each others homes began calling each other brothereven downtown in time church pastors hauled out cadillacs and electra s and led voterregistration motorcades one pastor the rev o m hoover of olivet institutional baptist church went on a personal fasting and praying for black folks to wake up crusade then came dr martin_luther_king preaching pride in our own and spurring registration drives that added thousands of new names to black voter rolls the local core chapter did the same thing with part of a ford foundation grant black councilmen who had aint ready notions in began passing the word in their wards this time were with stokes yes yes yes e cn ahmed eans an astrologybent leader of black nationalists eased up on his vow to avoid everything the white beasts arc invohed in he announced that this time he had registered and he would vote with this kind of solid backingand that of the influential plain dealer newspaper which he had finally talked o cr to his sidestokes went into the october primary not as an independent but this time as a democrat in a direct challenge of locher his old foe despite a racist campaign waged against him by the local democratic organization vote for stokes and martin_luther_king will run city hall and lochers nationality supporters save cleveland from a nigger mayor stokes came out of the primary more than votes ahead checkouts showed he had trounced locherand a third challenger frank p celesteby getting per cent of the black ote plus a surprising otes from whites it was a highly personal victory for stokes he had become the first black man to smash the monopoly of power held in cleveland for a quartercentury by white machinecontrolled democrats but the selfcongratulating didnt last long stokes knew that e en though he had won there still had been nearly people who oted against him many of these perhaps a majority were bitterly antinegro in the following months general election he knew most would cross party lines to vote for the white republican nominee seth c taft grandson of the th president of the united states if was the first political skirmish for taft and his amateurishness showed through wliile he paradctl with a baby elephant stokes plunged into the far west side wards and talked about preventing riots and making the streets safenot for your wife and daughter but for mine while taft made a point of drinking milk in public stokes breakfasted with foreignlanguage newspaper editors asking them to help me too prove something about the american dream he dropped in at tea parties and charmed everyone with his grace and elan wearing perfectlycut doublebreasted suits he lunched with industrial leaders and amazed them with his knowledge of industrial growth potential and fiscal reform wmiile overenthusiastic taft supporters stuffed mail boxes with vote right otc white literature stokes was at a polish meeting hall saying if any of you happen to be antinegro you dont know anything of your own history thaddeus kosciuszko he told them had urged the education of slaves back in reolutionarv davs and adam curowski had preached the abolitionist message to abraham lincoln thats what kosciuszko and curowski were doing a pretty long time ago he said so do you mean to tell me that a polish person can t vote for a negro in this day and time he ileased whites with promises that there would be no black cabinet no black takeover if he were elected mayor and that the stokely carmichaels would not be welcome in my town he went further reminding that he had been the only democratic legislator to sponsor a bill empowering the governor to send national cuard troops into a city een before a riot engulfs it such talk worried the black east side where word had been passed for months among riotprone elements to cool it laby for carl but black voters had seen stokes picketing banks and grocery stores they knew about the civil_rights and welfare legislation he had fought for in the house they figured that deep down he was soul whispered call post reporter bob williams to black nationalist ahmed evans man you know hes got to fool the beasts with a little toming in order to win this thing stokes personal politicking was backed up by a volunteer organization so complex that perhaps only campaign manager dr clement knew everything that was going on in the campaign nerve center on the ground floor of the rockefeller building telethons were conducted with banks of minis itchboards setup by andy bass a voung communications expert from the suburbs who had just returned from viet nam he had been consultant for the entire communications network of gen william westennoreland while operations manager mrs geraldine williams darted from room to room checking the order of things bill hunter a husky earold graduate student from fairway kans issued instructions to cadres of the college students who had volunteered to doorknock and pass out literature in the negro wards in other rooms white papers on key issues were drafted or finances were checked or newspaper ads and tv spots planned upstairs in a room marked no admittance elmer whiting a negro certified public accountant peered at tabletop computers which spewed out projections of the no ember s ote what we did said dr glement was simply approve every good idea and then say to people now this is your area youre in charge of it you make ev erything work dr clement estimates that campaign costs would be up around half a million dollars if we counted actual costs plus the value of the volunteers talents and time and said dr clement as he sent out feelers for money to make up a campaign deficit the thing which perhaps gives us the greatest pride is the fact that of all the money weve spent something like per cent of it came out of black peoples pockets id say thats some kind of record as it relates to black people getting together to support a black candidate and so it went for the month of the campaign then on election day despite a heavy snowfall clevelanders flocked in profusion to the polls from the beginning of the tuesday night count it was clear that tens of thousands of whites had crossed iarty lines to vote for taft as taft votes piled up gloom settkd over stokes headquarters by midnight there were tears in some stokes folks eyes there was no laughter when somebody tried to make a joke dont givt up yet he said carl hasnt lost until vou see downtown cleveland in flames finally the tide began changing the vote from the slowcounting east side wards began rolling in stokes began inching past taft for the first time actory came soon after am stokes taft stokes whitewashed headquarters auditorium broke into happy bedlam reverends john t weeden and henry j payden and e t caviness began mingling with kids doing something like the charleston to a dixieland band black nationalists who had been sullen began smiling and mingling with stokes white volunteers and then there was clevelands new mayorelect coming into the auditorium dragging along his wife shirley behind a flying wedge of police a roar went up from the crowd and stokes was lifted onto the stage he thanked everybodythe poles the slovenians the italians everybody a kid holding a stokesforpresident sign shouted what about soul babv and stokes continued and negroes and someone else shouted what about us jews and he said and all the jews he said that never before had he known the meaning of the words god bless america and then he wus gone off to a big suite in the clevelandsheraton hotel for celebrating and picking the team in would need to help him in his new job seth tafts headquarters were perhaps steps across superior avenue from the sheraton hotel at about am taft took those steps across the street to congratulate the new mayorelect of the town for black people there was a great deal of significance in that short walk the patrician grandson of a united states president had gone to congratulate the greatgrandson of a slave ning iipsef since none of the published straw polls newspaper columnists or radio commentators in indianas second largest city had predicted hatchers victory in the primar against the affluence of a goliath democratic machine its builtin campaign workers on city and county payrolls its hundreds of paid parttime vvorkers and years of hardnose experience in clubhouse and precinct politics all this black little david had going for him was a shoestring and a melange of untested volunteers meanwhile the republican primary had been won by joseph b radigan collegedropout son of an irish immigrant and proprietor of a downtown furniture store inherited from his familv lie had recelved quite a small but sufficient votes in his first trv for nublic office although katz buried the hatchet and publicly endorsed hatcher many of his department heads began wearing radigan buttons after the primaiy why would heretofore loyal democrats back a republican an answ er came swiftly in july vvhen the alldeinocratic city council eliminated the jobs of the mayors executive secretary and his clerktypist from next years million budget the budget passed by a to vote with hatcher dsstmting no one is fooled he declared the budget was cut to cripple and hamper the operation of the citv next vear nevertheless hatchers team launched operation saturation a doortodoor effort to register eligible voters there wcre none of the obvious displays neither the clenched fists and black powder slogans nor the shouts not even a whisper against vvhitey instead of indulging themselves in the luxury of merely talking about black powder they took care of business they worked diligently to bring it about in this team of v olunteers this model of togetherness there was a new breedall young enthusiastic disciplined all aware of how to run an election or be run out of it calculating closely they knew they needed at least per cent of the white vote to help swing an election that hatcher would otherwise narrowly lose if we had to do it all ov er again and knew the obstacles maybe we wouldnt hav e tried it at all admits campaign manager henry coleman who had started vvork on hatchers campaign months earlier during that time few of garys negro ministers or established negro politicians jumped on the hatcher bandwagon they didnt think we had a chance of winning coleman recalls and they didnt think the time was right i told tliem it was now or never but was it many of garys whites had dramatically demonstrated their strong antinegro sentiment when they helped alabama gov george c wallace defeat exgov matthew e welsh in lake county by to votes in the indiana presidential primary many others were quietly running to garys suburbs hke medievalists fleeing the black plague county officials told hatcher they didnt think the people in gary were ready for a negro mayor which people he wanted to know thousands voted for me in the primary and i think i can win the election in november im not predicting a runaway election it will be close but i think i can win it the most important of the county officials hatcher confronted was short pudgy shiftyeyed john krupa county clerk county democratic chairman holder of the key posts of secretary of the county election board and secretary of the board of canvassers middleclass extoller of the virtues of hard work and selfreliance superamerican patriot passionate anticommunist a wouldbe social analyst associating the american civil liberties union with subversion and applauding the requirement that garbage collectors and all other municipal employes take loyalty oaths he had once told hatcher that he krupa is polish and the poles had to vvait their turn to get powder the trouble with you people is youre not willing to vvait your turn youre too impatient krupa scolded with an iknovvnegroes confidence after i vvon the democratic primary in may hatcher recalls kinpa met with me and said he wanted to name the police chief and controller and several other key officers and i told him look too many pcople have worked too hard in this and im not going to abdicate my responsibilites or sell them out im going to name my own police chief and controller undaunted the democratic chief demanded that hatcher denounce specifically and by name martin_luther_king jr stokely carmichael controv ersial folk singer joan baez h rap brown and marlon brando who with other american liberals had sponsored a peace ad in the london times when hatcher refused krupa the latter distributed a reprint of an alleged hatcher inteniew in muhammad speaks the black muslim newspaper he was quoted as suggesting hanoi shotild try captured american pilots as war criminals krupa did not publicize the papers later retraction of the story and its admission that hatcher had been misquoted although the retraction supported hatchers own denials red white and blue radigan billboards blossomed all ov er gary proclaiming the republican candidate per cent american and tluis inferring that hatcherwhose ancestors arriv ed on these shores at least two centuries before radigans irishvvas unamerican hatcher refused to discuss the war in viet nam further on grounds that the mayors race is a local campaign and we ought to talk about what we are going to do right here in gary as for my denouncing stokely carmichael he declared tv e already said again and again im opposed to anyone who advocates violence krupa has a long list of people he wants me to denounce and if i denounce them today hed have a whole new list tomorrow he vvouldnt support me if i stood on my head the young fighter suggested instead that county democratic leaders denounce george chacha chacharis one major democrat who was backing radigan gars mayor from to chacha had been convicted of income tax evasion in as for knipas charges that hatcher was surrounded with pinkocs the nominee answered he wasnt accountable for the motives of all his supporters i am certain i will get a lot of votes from prostitutes he said at the time but it is obviously unfair to hold me responsible for their attitudes or willingness to break the law if the county chairman has any prof of subversion and brings it to me i would be the first to act and disassociate myself from such people no such evidence has been delivered still krupa persisted in his opposition to hatcher the extremist label he pinned on the democratic nominee stuck and was reflected in the cold reception hatcher received on voteseeking tours of supermarkets and shopping centers in white neighborhoods whites avoided him many refused to shake his hand sometimes in speeches to indifferent even hostile white audiences he would shock and in a few cases embarrass them by stopping abruptly and saying i know you havent heard a word i said all you see in front of you is black but if by some miracle race was niled out and i and my opponent were considered only on qualifications this election wouldnt even be close all my opponent talks about is that he comes from an old family long established in garv he savs hes been in the furniture business years i want to see that he stays there meanwhile the democratic organization reportedly was offering to anyone who would tear down hatcher campaign posters although krupa had claimed it did not have enough money to support the democratic nominee upset by krupas vendetta both indiana gov roger d branigin and gordon st angelo democratic state chairman demanded he resign his party post kriqa refused claiming patriotism came before party loyalty it was not a matter of the candidates color he insisted a replica of the american flag fluttering on his tie pin the only color he was worried about was the red white and blue he claimed he expressed his alleged doubts about hatchers patriotism even though knowing vice president humphrey and sen robert f kennedy d n y had received satisfactory security checks on hatcher before endorsing him by now the fight between krupa and hatcher was troubling top national democrats who feared negroes across the country would turn away from their party in if hatcher lost the election in june he visited washington ate a white house dinner with president johnson met with housing sect robert c weaver and labor sect w willard wirtz and was assured of help from the democratic national committee still as the summer wore on hatchers campaign funds dipped to new lows gary mayoralty campaigns usually cost more than a quartermillion dollars hatcher had cut his to the bone but he still needed about x to pay for billboard signs radio time literahire and office rentals by august he had decided to take a big gamble which his campaign manager was certain would waste money he inserted a advertisement in the new york times and a ad in the gary posttribune the expenditures left in his campaign chest at least three persons had mortgaged their homes to help raise money for the ads the ad headings read for gods sake lets get ourselves together the line text surrounding a photograph of a white policeman clubbing a negro went on to appeal for contributions from nonconstituents across the country as well as for an end to bigotry ignorance violence within a week the ads had brought in some x in small donationsenough to cover their costs by october hatcher had received about in contributions and it seemed everything was going to be all right after all but krupa had other plans he ordered namesmost of them negroes stricken from the voter registration rolls in gary and added whites who he alleged were new registrants now it seemed hatchers defeat was certain yet the same imagination which had inspired him to advertise for campaign funds moved him to make the second most important decision in his mayoral campaign he filed a federal law suit against krupa and the lake county democratic organization charging them with disfranchising negro voters in violation of the voting rights act and adding fictitious white registrants he had filed it on trickortreat day he explained because he wanted all the tricks to occur on halloween and not election dav within a few days the u s justice department filed a similar suit as a followup to three weeks of intensive fbi investigation on the eve of election day a threejudge federal court in hammond ind convened for a single hearing of the hatcher and justice department suits quickly an fbi agent testified a man team he headed had uncovered x fictitious names mostly in white areas other testimony revealed one way of padding the voter rolls had been to find a building and add a name for each window a usedcar dealer said a voter was registered to his lot although no one lived there another witness said she managed a unit apartment building in a white neighborhood and oters were registered to the building who did not to her knowledge live there the most damaging testimony came from mrs marian tokarski yearold polish mother of three and a democratic precinct committeewoman who had been duped into believing hatcher was a communist she admitted she had added fictitious names to the voting rolls in a white precinct in an effort to defeat hatcher a man who gave her the list of names told her iron workers would cast the phony votes for the men on the list and prostitutes would vote for the women because they were the only ones who had the guts to do it tlie federal court niled krupa and the democratic organization had indeed registered fraudulent voters as hatcher and the justice department charged and had tried to disenfranchise thousands of negro voters apologizing for not having time to make a more specific ruling hours before garys polls were to open the court ordered false names removed from the voters lists and stemlv warned lake county officials to obey election laws hatcher had won a battle but was still about to lose the war to his chagrin gov branigin had called out the national guard to drill on election dav at armories in towns minutes awav from garv loose talk of violence was further fanned bv mavor katz who warned force will be met with force to hatcher these actions allegedly designed to forestall violence were in fact pronoeative they were selffulfilling prophecies of his defeat an alreadv tense gar ached now under the strain television newsmen who had sought to build platforms for their cameras complained that all the plvood in town had been sold to merchants anxious to board up their windows even krupa relaxed his busy campaign against hatcher long enough to phone his wife to see if workmen had boarded up the windows of his home in nearby east chicago squads of city and state police kept a watchful eye on the black ghetto election day dawned crisp and cloudless the weather it seemed was going to cooperate with hatcher wdio needed a heavy voter turnout to win but within minutes after the polls opened at am a storm of a different sort broke some voting machines were reported mysteriously jammed in negro precincts as hatcher scurried about town in his telephoneequipped car to investigate one of his precinct workers told him a call for repairs on a defective machine had been placed at am but repairmen did not arrive until four hours later when they left she said we found the hatcher label had been switched from the bottom position to the top position on the hatchers parents were his staunchest supporters during his campaign gary has lkhn as democratic as ncarbv chicago for years had last republican mayor in machine to confuse voters seven persons had used the machine before the switch was discovered another worker reported a republican committee woman had ordered hatchers poll watcher out of the polling place yet another hatcher aide complained theyve been voting every stumble bum they can get in here in a rare display of anger he promised privately if i lose this election im going to let my hair grow long by early afternoon the star witness in the federal court vote rigging suit mrs marian tokarski had come to hatchers headquarters and tearfully recited a talc of tlireats against her life telephoned during the night if hatcher wins promised one caller you will never live to shake his hand wlien the hanied candidate heard her plight he sent four of his security aides to her home to protect her despite persistent talk of potential election day violence the overall ote tumout easily wiped out gars previous record of voters for the mayoral election it represented about per cent of the persons registered for the election observers contended howtver that part of that total included ghosts many of whom were apparently frightened away from the polls by the threat of possible federal contempt of court charges the official count gave vote to hatcher and to radigana razorthin difference of votes hatcher had received per cent of the total white vote including per cent in one white gary precinct radigan had gained less than four per cent of the total negro turnout hatcher had also led the democratic ticket to victory behind him with the exception of two council candidates who had failed to endorse him black powder the fniits of months of hard work had triumphed arriving at city hall at about election night after sweating out election returns in his law office hatcher was met at the door by only about a dozen white officials looking glum sheepish frightened a few offering polite congratulations he was escorted to the mayors heavilycarpeted walnuttrimmed office where katz smalltalked about maor carl b stokes victorious cleveland eleetion then invited hatcher to tiv out for size the black leatherbound mavors executive chair but the mavorelect stood instead at the desk absorbed wth an almost monkish intensity in his note pacj scribblings mcanwlile in the city council chambers off in another part of the building a predominantlynegro audience awaited a victory statement from garvs new mavor but hatcher was unhurried not out of arrogance but because he had not received word of the official vote tallies from kmpas office he was being extra cautious only the day before lie had promised an enthusiastic supporter when i get elected were going to have the biggest inaugural ball tliis city has c er seen were going to sene soul food you can believe that but now there was a glimmer of a chance that there would be no ball it was a sobering thought and hatcher was not going to rush his delayed moment of triumph mayor katz had phoned the county chairman and been told he would have the official vote tallies in about minutes hatcher waited even after the official word came he still waited reading and rereading his threepage victory speech occasionally penciling a revision as he passed finally tlirough an ante room leading to the cmincil chamber he even paused long enough to say hello over a xhone to the young son of a negro city hall official now he was bathed in the glare of klieg lights acknowledging the roar from the packed city council when you went to the polls todav he said finally you knew our city was about to be strangled by the left hand of comiption and the right hand of backwardness you have broken that grip and we plan to remake the city the room trembled as waves of sound ricocheted from wall to wall the election showed that the negro vote isnt for sale and that a significant number of white voters no longer pay heed to the old bugaboos about the danger of blacks and reds a loud amen rose from the audience this victory presents an exciting challenge hatcher continued we shall lead the way for the whole countr to follow we shall prove that urban america need not wallow in decav that our cities can be revived and their people rejuvenated yes we shall prove that diversity can be a source of enrichment that at least the people of one city in the nation have decided finally to get themselves together the young orator had always said he wanted to become mayor of all the people that he would not show favoritism to negroes yet he had insisted his people had been suffering getting the short end of the stiek in every phase of life one proof was an indiana state civil_rights commission study which revealed negroes aecount for only per cent of all city employes despite constituting about per cent of carxs population they were in lowerpaying jobs and held only two of departmenthead posts out of indiana cities gary ranked th in the municipal employment of negroes so starting with the city hall hatcher was going to remake gary a formidable task indeed tlie united states steel coq had built the city years ago on the sandy southern tip of lake michigan and made it into the perfect image of a company town soon its skyline was dominated by the huge smokestacks of mills bustling with croats poles czechs slovaks serbs hungarians greeks italiansimmigrants brought in by the company to do its dirty work the first negroes had come at the end of world war i imported to break a strike since then they had been squeezed into an area of only square miles although the city sprawls over square miles meanwhile the crime syndicate found a cozy haven in gary prostitutes charging to worked in shifts to avoid occupational fatigue with the syndicates gross topping a billion dollars a year in lake county northwest indiana crime commission estimate some elected officials made corruption a way of life an amenable mayor could figiue on an extracmricular income during his fouryear term of from million to millionall for doing nothing the only real mistake a local official could make was to fail to report his graft on his incometax as did two recent mavors who were convicted of income tax evasion hatchers predecessor a martin katz who ran as the refonn candidate in pleads that you cant change established patterns of or years overnight and garys police have made little effort to do so into this sordid picture comes richard gordon hatcher unburdened by political deals so spartan he neither smokes drinks nor uses profanity so dedicated he works to hours a day so religious he prays in church on new years eve while others are partying so committed his gary soul brothers see him as a beautiful black together cat he had pleaded in his victory speech lets now transfer our campaign slogan lets get ourselves together into action and make gary a new and human city hatcher piutially blames gary lawlessness on the example set by many in public positions thus the attitude of many of our citizens is that anything can be fixed he says to begin ending such public pennissiveness he plans a thorough reorganization of the garv police department in his announced battle against crime he will be hampered by an indiana law which requires his police chief to be a man with fiv e years service on the local force therefore he will not be able to scour the nation for the most qualified police boss since neither black nor white gary school children come up to national standards on achievement tests the new mayor criticizes the school board four whites and one negro for being more eommitted to thwarting integration than quality education you can stand at one spot near where i live and see six different grade schools he says tliey were put there so when the negro ghetto expanded the negro children would go to ghetto schools and not white schools you cant run a school system like that and get quality education during his first two years in office three school board v acancies will occur and hatchers replacements will help determine the future of garys school system meanwhile his toughest problem is to correct such inequities in the tax stnicture as the one involv ing u s steel state law says a steel plant should be assessed for taxes at per cent of its value hatcher explains for years now u s steel has been making improvements in their plants here in the millions of dollars and yet their assessment keeps going down its liard to get the records but we think theyre assessed at to per cent of their value now it should be per cent if we could raise it to just per cent why you could build schools in gary wnth gold doorknobs we could tear down all the slums the next mayors got to sit down and have a noholds barred session with u s steel hatcher also wants to deal with the high rate of urban decav in garv and an air pollution problem which givxs his cit the highest incidenee of tuberculosis in the countrv he would do awav with the mayors flower fundthat two per cent wage kickback he alleges his predecessors have been getting from city employes to help bankroll elections the implementation of his extensive program will depend partially on a city council which theoretically is sympathetic seven are democrats and two are republicans four of the seven democrats are negroes and one of the fiv e whites is a mexicanamerican a democrat holding the balance of power but ultimately the young mayors heavy responsibilities will rest on his owm broad shoulders during his crucial term in office his ayear salarya drop from his law practice incomewill only partially compensate him for the four years of hard vvork that lie ahead of him yet he is young strong and vigorous the product of sturdy stock the one person who has had a steady and solid influence on me has been mv father he savs he is now he was a laborer in a foundry for years and retired from there six or seven years ago and became a custodian in a countv building he was absolutely honest about eveiything he also paid his bills on time even if it meant going without meals the bills were iaid on time i was impressed by those two things he also put a lot of faith in god i picked that up too he said that if you believed in god god could overcome everything when we first started in this campaign people said that with the forces against us we didnt have a chance but i thought that we were right i thought that what we were trng to do was right i never thought we would lose t he breezes are balmy and the hospitality warm this is the bahamas all islands and cays covering

in the purchasing department and four months later to his present position it also is the method that freed barrows from what he considers the worst part of being in jail the inabifity to make decisions a man wants to make decisions right asserts barrows the right added more for emphasis than to pose a questionas is the boston style with upwards of million worth of equipment and some employes under his control barrows is involved in the kind of decisionmaking that he once believed was the personal domain of the irish barrows who is of portugueseafrican ancestry was born alben de barros in wareham mass a small town near cape cod about miles from boston ilis father came from the cape verde islands when he was arrested in the newspapers and courts picked up his name as banows he never bothered to straighten out the error wlien he was one year old his father divorced his mother and moved to california along with a sister and three brothers alben remained in wareham with his mother childhood for barrows was a series of moves when not with his mother he was with various relatives barrows does not remember those days as being especially harsh even though the family was on welfare he did however nin away from home once and confides guess i never really had the love and attention i needed an extended sickness caused his repeating the fourth grade after that he just lost interest in school and refused to go it was the beginning of rebellion by the time he was barrows who was living in boston found himself in reform school he had stolen an automobile released eight months later he was sent by the courts to cahfomia to live with his father it was then that he first learned that in the divorce decree his father had been granted custody of the children the elder barrows or de barros was employed as a foundry worker with the southern pacific railroad in sacramento calif and was able to secure for his son a job in the foundry it was not barrows shot at he left the foundry which today he disdains as the place that killed his fatherand lied about his age so that he could join the army that same year he married a woman who would bear his child and divorce him shortly after he entered idrison his son who now has a family of his own is more or less a stranger to barrows as a military policeman assigned to the motor pool barrows made staff sergeant in the army eeryihing was going fine when in i was assigned to fort deens a camp near boston it didnt take long for him to fall in with the old crowdi thought i was a big deal and eventually take the wol route one night in boston dri ing a stolen car barrows picked up a strange white woman an affair began it culminated in a boston courtroom with the states ersion of the story differing markedly from barrows he was charged with kidnapping the woman robbing her at gunpoint and raping herafter being arrested on suspicion of car theft i was framed says barrows matteroffactly itales of black men and white women being intenupted in their fronc by irate husbands and the women crying rape are legend in this land in another region barrows might not have lived to tell the tale spared the agony of facing a lynch mob southern style barrows nonetheless gives a mean review of a black man at the mercy of an irish power structure in a boston courtroom he recalls the policeman who arrested me was irish the woman who accused me was irish tlie prosecuting attorney was irish tlie judge was irish tk court officers were irish and even the iublic defender assigned to defend me was irish barrows lawyer advised him to plead guilty they told me because youre black you dont have a chance a guilty plea he was informed would probably result in a five to sevenyear sentence alben barrows however who admits he was rather a wild kid was not without principle nor did that imposing courtroom assemblage etlinically speaking manage to turn him green relaxing in his comfortable dorchester boston apartment barrows fires up as he relives that memorable scene one senses that even today he would fight the good fight odds notwithstanding i had to fight the system he contends you cant go along with the system felt that pleading guilty would hae been saying because im black im no good giving in says barrows would also have been saying that his family was no good that his friends were no good my motivation was race pride and pride in my family so he left the courtroom with what he now describes as a black hatred for everything irish a life sentence and the dire prospect of at least years behind bars before becoming eligible for parole barrows became officially another number in the massachusetts state prison at charlestown the institution which closed several yciirs ago was noted for crushing its inmates all sentences to the state pen included spending the first hours in the hole sohtary he remembers it vividly they stripped me naked placed me in the hole the walls were sweating water you couldnt spread your arms i thought life was over fifteen years i couldnt believe it i wondered how id survive initiation concluded the fish prison term for new inmates took his place alongside his fellow convicts only to learn that the axioms of tlie human conditionsuch as conferring statuswere as much at work in the prison community as in any other stoolpigeons alone were lower than sex offenders in the prison social strata guilt or lack of it didnt matter people just dont give you anything for nothing laments barrows you have to earn respect and everything else it was seemingly the first lesson he learned at charlestown one that did not come easy it persists during those first months at charlestown where most of the guards and not a few of the prisoners were irish a harrows was a man at battle with his hatred then came the discovery that the only place i lived was within my own mind some of the guards helped the young convict understand that it was up to him to make something worthwhile out of prison life as opposed to insuring his ovvm misery some of the screws prison guards were vicious dirty bastards recalls barrows but some of them were very human guys survival compelled barrows to control his rage to look out for himselfwhich meant making an effort to get along with the irish guards and avoid trips to the blue room a cell where iinnily prisoners were taken and handled with something less than care looking out for himself meant also developing that place where a barrows had discovered lifehis mind t realized quite early how stagnant prison life could be that if a man wasnt careful he would come out of jail the same age he went in he speaks rather sympathetically about the cats vvffio just sat around remembering who finally found themselv es doing nothing but remembering barrows then did make one decision of utmost importance while in prisonthe decision to grow his outside accomplishments remarkable though they are hardly overshadow his achievements as an inmate in addition to performing regular prison work assignments barrows became president of the prison debating team won the heavyweight boxing championship at the age of played saxophone in the band was a reader in an inmates club that taped books for the blind was a member of the weight lifting and baseball teams started playmg football in his early s and was later elected coach and led the team to a league championship he also operated a laundry business that enabled him to save more than the above feats were packed into the years through after his transfer from charlestown to the massachusetts correctional institution in norfolk county unlike charlestown it is noted for hberal policies and rehabilitation the introspective convicts growth however began long before norfolk in his first months at charlestown he learned that the only way to keep up with the happenings on the outside vvas to talk to incoming prisoners id even get them to show me the new dances says barrows aware also of the need to communicate with the outer world barrows soon became embarrassed by his lack of letterwriting skill i didnt understand grammar and as far as i was concerned the only capital letter to be used was the d in dear soandso and the rest of the letter was just one long sentence with a period at the end the charlestown prison library was meager but it did have a dictionary which became a bible for inmate barrows diligently he taught himself grammar and punctuation to increase his word power he read a newspaper feature called thoughts for the day frequently consulting the dictionary some years later at norfolk he took advantage of a relatively wellequipped library though he never formally completed a grade beyond the fourth barrows today can speak m moderately technical terms when discussing klh and the specialized world of electronics is conversant on shake speare and literary classics such as war ami peace and uses words as uncommon as avarice with ease barrows obsession with the dictionary calls to mind another excharlestowm and norfolk inmate who distinguished himself upon retiiniing to civilian life yeah i knew malcolm well savs barrows with notable enthusiasm the late malcolm_x arrix ed at charlestown three years after barrow s i remember when he first came in the yard the day he came out of the hole it was in i remember the day well because wc were having a sitdown strikeout of which an inmate counsel wns formedand malcolm came over and hung out with us barrows does not claim to have ahvays agreed with malcolms ideas but he does credit the assassinated black nationalist leader with helping to awake in me greater pride in myself barrows pride in having known malcolm is mixed w ith fnistration it is the frustration of one who has forgotten details about a person which no doubt would have been remembered had he suspected that the wnrld would one day acclaim that persons greatness barrows does however remember much about the men who wcre his fellows throughout the week ordeal the names come easy they are of guys who went mad or tried to escape and of the halfback at norfolk who might have played pro ball were he not a thief the story about a brother who was so heavy so deep that not only the inmates but even the ginuds and prison officials would come to him for advice is one barrows enjoys telling he emotionalizes the bondage of chained men as he recalls the disillusionment of two prisoners who worked patiently for months and months on a perfect escape plan only to be foiled at the end on a hummer it is not unlike listening to a man talk about his anny experiences on the surface he might insist he hated them and doubtless he hasnt the desire to relive them but for a time both the place and the people became a part of him for barrows prison was a place where a man had to be himself more so than on tlie outside he finds the outer societv more in sensitive today than before he went to prison and allows that he observed by association with new inmates that growth towards insensitivity a man of considerable humor who has learned to appreciate being alive barrows is critical of a society that takes all save precious little for granted people out here miss so much of life because they cant really dig it says barrows resuming his place in society barrows spent a while looking for landmarks that were no more but not the least of the changes he encountered had simply to do with people and their pace people running where are they going asks barrows rhetorically thev remind me of flies up against a window pane if they played it cool theyd last a lot longer a man who likes to talk he also is a man who listens and perceives if society were to perceive itself abetted by his particular frame of reference an analogy would be found perhaps in barrows comment on his own chess game i play chess too aggressively ive ne er dug why i play it so aggressive knowing its a losers way of playing barrows comments on society are more philosophical than indictive yet like others who have paid that socalled debt to society he has seen through the pretentious innocence of those who have never stared through bars or spent ten days in a ratinfested dark cell on bread and water because they blocked a guards view after years without going swimming or ice skating or eating hot pastrami or touching a womanwhich are a few of the things alben barrows missed he found out that society still wanted an extra pound of flesh owing to the stigma society imposes upon them excons often confront the problem of having acquired skills in prison that are of little use to them on the outside as an inmate barroxxs xx orked as a tailor a medical secretary a foundry molder a lathe operator and a baker among other things prior to going to klh he xvas turned axvay from a number of places where he sought employment because of his background only menial jobs paying cents or a dollar an hour were offered to me says barroxvs i knexv i xvas better than that more confident than most men xxhose lives have not been restricted by the judgment of society and his ego still in order barrows refused to settle for less than xvhat he deemed to be his oxxii xvorth he reached in his pocket for a book of matches one afternoon and came up xxith the business card of paul revey then manager of manufacturing for klh two days before he xvas paroled barroxvs had served as master of ceremonies at a norfolk function xvhich hex ey at tended impressed ith the eloquent convicts poise revey gave him the card and told him to contact him if he needed a job barrows suspected somewhat cynically that revey had probably meant well but had forgotten him however feeling he had nothing to lose he made liis way to klh re ey introduced him to shor and his new life ixgan personnel director shor says it is the companys philosophy to give any applicant a new chance we hire parolees known alcoholics anybody who we think will do the job says shor the company payroll includes along with barrows other exconvicts of some soo employes per cent are negro all were concerned about is whether or not people can learn the work and most important if theyre willing to work it was at klh that banows met his wife of a little more than a year mrs diane barrows was then employed as an assembly line worker at the plant at a company social gathering he just walked up and introducd himself he told me he had spent years in prison she recalls at first she thought it a joke his past was not yet common knowledge in the plant at that time the couple began dating immediately and within three months were married mrs barrows who is of italian and greek extraction insists that neither her husbands imprisonment his race nor the years difference in their ages presents a hangup for her hes taught me an awful lot since weve been married she says sometimes i see him sitting in a chair worrying and well i just dont know i guess hes thinking about the time in prison but hes told me all about it nd hes usually cheerful barrows wife recalls also from her days at klh that everxbody idolized al they would come to him for advice or to borrow money or anything according to shor everybody in the plant knows barrows and he knows evcrone bv his first name it is all believable after a walk through the plant with him and likewise after a walk through norfolk with him his assertion that he is hung up on people i just like eerything thats alivebecomes real last octoler with special permission from wiirden philip j piccard barrows visited the massachusetts correctional institution norfolk the prison he left behind on december al youre looking like a human being kidded a guard hey old man yelled an inmate ill see if i can straighten out your life when i get out of here inmates gave him the business about having picked up a little weight and the graying hair the atmosphere was warm engaging and anomalous to the pedestrian concepts about men who have robbed banks or pushed narcotics or murdered their wives hey al i hear youre doin great out there keep it up kid hollered a prisoner from a doorway it tunied out that he was the same guy barrows had spoken of the previous day the only cat i ever saw on death row who didnt come away all messed up a job at charlestown that holds haunting memories for barrows is that of tier ninncr on death row tier runners lrought food and other essentials to men who were condemned to die in the electric chair only one man was executed during barrows stay at charlestown but he notes that the othersexcept that oneeven after their death penalties were commuted wnre never again the same death row plays an awful trick on a mans mind laments barrows they became vegetables just staring blankly moral judgments aside barrows believes along with many of the social thinkers of the day that capital punishment is utterly cruel for allowing such a lapse between the time a man is told he must die and the actual execution is he against capital punishment if youre paid to push a button to kill a man youre a hired murderer is his answer presumably he isas one would expect rehabilitated men to beagainst murder visiting norfolk whre he became nostalgic on the football field and in the auditorium where he irsed to debate was a homecoming for barrows when the visit ended howe er he experienced the chilling sensation that comes wdth realizing you have inadvertently caused hurt barrows sensed behind the smiles the inmates pain seeing me frt to come and go as i please had to hurt them a little said bar rows but maybe my visit gave some of the guys more hope jail is behind him but barrows has not turned his back on that which shall ever be a part of him the junior executive lends much of his spare time to a ymca fellowship program which assists newly released parolees in their adjustment he participates in eening meetings with the men and moreover is active in the greater boston area speaking to church groups and other social groups on the plight of deprived children as a parolee himself barrows finds not being able to leave the state of massachusetts the major inconvenience he would like to travel it is of course one of numerous restrictions he must live with until the board grants final pardon watch the ice al said warden piccard the day barrows visited norfolk inherent in that traditional waniing to excons is the possibility of a slip barrows however does not fear such an event and it is difficult to imagine anything in the outer world challenging his determination and character more than it was challenged at norfolk in it was then after serving years that he went before the parole bolud for the first time tlie board asked him as he had been asked years before if he was guilty of the crimes for which he had been accused and sentenced barrows believed that if he had cooperated with the boardowned up to the guilthe would have been paroled he insisted nevertheless upon his innocence it cost him five more years doubtless it was more than enough time for a man to examine the value of his own integrity he is today a proud man who must ache unspeakably when he says if i am a good man the jail experience made me so if i am a man period it made me one norfolk chaplain robert dutton whose acquaintance with barrows is a long one was asked to give reason for his confidence that barrows will succeed on the outside and not return to prison as so many excons do when men have long criminal rccords they often develop patterns of criminal behaviour said the rev dutton al barrows has w ith the elections of carl b stokes and richard g hatcher to the mayorships of cleveland ohio and gary ind respectively negro americans can now point to brothers in elective offices ranging from that of justice of the peace in mississippi to u s senator in massachusetts not since the days of the reconstniction have negroes held so many and so important public offices and not since the days of the reconstruction has the climate been so right for negroes to make use of political power which has lain dormant much too long in fact the year may have touched off a decade that may well become the new reconstniction just years after the beginning of the historic reconstruction that followed the civil war reconstruction no uring the earlv vears of reconstruction following the civil war the th and th amendments to the constitution of the united states made citizens and potential voters out of the millions of freed slaves throughout the south by the end of november in some american citizens had registered to vote in the states that had made up the confederacyand more than of them were idack spurred on by the republican party and groups called loyal leagues negroes flocked to the registrars in droves the newlyfreed slaves were so conscientious about registering that in several states where whites substantially outnumbered negroes in population negroes outnumbered whites at the polls alabama for instance had a population of whites and negroes in but by there were registered negro voters and only registered whites in south carolina where negroes comprised roughly per cent of the population they made up more than per cent of the electorate blacks in mississippi had enough power to send hiram r revels and blanche k bruce to the u s senate although neither was elected by popular vote power of unity t hough the black vote in the south during reconstruction was unsophisticated and sometimes too easily swayed both by black and white republican leaders it had strength in numbers and a unitv that white democrats could not shake in the ten years of the reconstruction negro voters in eight of the southern states sent a total of men to washington and north carolina south carolina and virginia continued sending black men to congress until the turn of the century during the rd congress from to south carolina alone had four sitting in the house and alabama florida and mississippi each had one the record seven negro congressmen in the house was matched in the th congress as south carolina had two and louisiana north carolina alabama florida and mississippi had one each negro representation in congress reached its highest idoint that year as mississippi also sent bruce to the u s senate within the states negroes held offices ranging from justice of the peace to governor and several hundred sat in the legislatures of their state capitals in south carolina black legislators outnumbered white from to in fact in negroes outnumbered whites to the end came soon he black men elected to office in the south were on the whole equal or superior to white men who had previously held the offices their programs were sound and despite many accusations to the contrary they were more honest and of a higher moral character than most of the whites who had held the same offices either state or federal but they were black and the southern democrats were determined that they would be toppled from power and topple them they did in a campaign of violence bribery intimidation and murder the white southern democrats destroyed the local republican organizations the ku klux klan whipped burned and lynched throughout the south the negro militia was disarmed and the whites armed as if for battle the federal government did nothing to protect the southern negroes by only south carolina florida louisiana and mississippi were still in the republican column the climax came in the elections of in south carolina and louisiana both the republicans and democrats claimed victory and both set up governments the republicans wanted federal troops to support their governments but there was a presidential election and the election of republican rutherford b hayes was being contested by democrat samuel j tilden tlie votes from south carolina louisiana and florida were in contention the electoral commission sustained hayes but a group of democrats launched a filibuster to prevent the orderly counting of electoral votes they planned to delay the count perhaps until inauguration day and leave the nation without a president but in back rooms a compromise was offered give the south home nde withdraw federal troops let the south handle the negro problem and the filibuster would be called off hayes would be president the agreement was made and reconstniction ended back into slavery he compromise of figuratively put the negro back into slaveiy no one knows what kind of a nation this would be today if the federal government had not allowed reconstruction to end some believe that it would in fact be in much better shape than it is today black republican leaders in the south were preachers teachers and lawyers who wanted to establish schools and to broaden the base of education black farmers wanted small farms which the could till as their own tenant farming and sharecropping would probably not have become the bane of the south and the cities of the north would not have the problem of riotprone black ghettos which grew from the great migrations of negroes from an unholy south to what was to become as nearly an unholy north the new reconstruction ut the compromise was made and during the next years the southern negro fled by the actual millions to the cities of the north segregated discriminated against and patronized he suffered in relatie silence until after world war h then slowly a revolt an undeclared civil war began first in nonviolent demonstrations and finally in the wild unpredictable violence of ghetto riots the negro declared that he was through with being a subjugated second class citizen out of a strange disjointed uncoordinated cry of protest that ranged from the black muslims and separatism to the naacp and total integration from ingenious teenage gangs in the slums to black collegians on ivy league campuses from housemaids to aka sorors there emerged a unity of jdurpose that culminated in something of which carl stokes being sworn in as mayor of cle eland in photograph on opposite page and richard g hatcher are a symbol the two men symbolize the beginning of the new reconstruction a period in which the million negroes in the united states can reassert their political power stokes and hatcher by securing some per cent of the negro vote were made mayors not by the few whites who otcd for them but by the many negroes who registered and cast their votes perhaps now negroes in other cities can profit from this example by sending as many as or negroes to washington as members of the house of representatives a coalition of negroes and perceptive whites could send two or three wellqualified men to washington as u s senators competent negro mayors should guide the destinies of other major american cities and predominantly negro wards should be represented in their city councils by black men of courage training and vision it is time that the million negroes in this country have more than token representation in the governing bodies of every village city and state within this land the new reconstruction has started well but it can continue only through such a unity as elected hatcher and stokes b oy meets girl is a familiar hollywood thomo hilt wlumi boy bappons to be black and girl is white the result can be a film that is extremelv fimnv while simiiltaneoiislv oiler m ing a great deal of food for thought with cmucss whos coming to dinner writer william rose producerdirector stanley kramer and superstars sidney poitier katharine hepbum and spencer tracy have joined forces to present what might be unique in cinematic history an honest realistic and at times hilarious portrayal of interracial love and the complications surrounding it what happens is that john prentice a brilliant young physician whose work takes him all over the world meets enchanting joey drayton a beautiful and rich young white woman who is studying at the university of hawaii witliin ten days they fall hopelessly in love and decide there is only one thing to doget married then the comedy begins joey finds it unthinkable that her liberal parents might not want her to marry john because he is a negro though john knows better he allows his optimism to lead him into believing that it might work out after all as soon as joey brings her young man home to san francisco to meet her parents it becomes evident that all might not be smooth sailing yet they want their parents approx alhis as well as hers how they finally get it is what makes gttess whos coming to dinner worth seeing much of the honestv of the film rests in the last performance of the late spencer tracy who ixrtrays the liberal father a cnisading newspaper publisher suddenly caught on the horns of a dilemma he is a man to be believed on the screen notes kramer whose dramatic ventures frequently have probed controversial subjects he knew this was his last film and his valedictory which was his last speech in the picture satisfied him in contrast johns father is a mailman some people asked me wbv if i wanted to make the film more real we didnt make poitier a postman sas kramer but nexer in a million years would this girl many a postman black or white she had to manw a remarkable fellow some viewers undoubtedly will inteqjret the film as a commentary on race relations in the united states but for kramer and members of the cast it is a comedy of the obvious a negro male and a xvhite girl the idea of a couple coming together and falling in love many also might be reminded of the recent interracial marriage of sect of state dean rusks daughter however kramer feels guess whos coming to dinner transcends racial implications who says its a story about the negro he asks its a story about young and old this generation wont live like the last generation simply because thats the way its supposed to be life has moved on f or the first time in its year history the national basketball association has growing pains chib owners blessed with pro basketballs new prestige and prosperity are suddenly confronted with the problem of becoming bigtiine the most vexing throb was applied by adventurous entrepreneurs who taking their cue from the nbas success decided to form th american basketball association hardly off the press agents drawing board the infant aba launched a frenzied drive for playcus including established pros semipros and name collegians the competition inboldcned players to demand and get fatter contracts especially from nba moguls jolted by the rival leagues tampering with super gate attractions like elgin baylor wilt chamberlain rick barry and nate thurmond these four along with at least five others now belong to pro basketballs lxxandnp club players whose contracts call for close to or more than mostly on a multivear basis bill russell and wilt chamberlain with their celebrated salary duel lecame charter members two seasons ago cazzie russell joined them last year oscar robertson thurmond barry baylor and bonus babies immv walker and bill bradley came in this year quite obviously most of the nbas growing pains are making owners howl and players smile a ll the familiar faces except rick barrys at san francisco are back for another round of nba play barr the only pro super star picked off by the aba will sit out his remaining year under contract to the warriors ricks absence is the main reason st louis will displace san francisco atop the western division as veteran playmaker and court sage guy rodgers pointed out nobody can lose points a game and still come out a winner the hawks barely missed the western title last year with barry going full blast key men in their early season splurge have been joe caldwell now playing fulltime at guard in place of fulltime coach richie guerin and old reliables lenny wilkens zelmo beaty and bill bridges los angeles has kept pace with archie clark ably filling in for jerry west despite elgin baylors heartening comeback from a nearcrippling kmee injury los angeles will be hard pressed to overcome its lack of depth in the east the ers look like a repeat winner for divisional and league titles they showed immense depth and power by winning while wilt chamberlain leisurely worked himself back into shape as always the celtics will provide the most opposition and could possibly go all the way if bill russell can even up his mantoman duel with wilt last year wilt achieved a lopsided triumph in scoring and rebounding and that was the difference between the two teams especially in the playoffs major factors in the race will be improvement of the knicks and detroit dave bing has moved the clock up on his timetable for super stardom and jimmy walker is showing steady improvement the pistons are hurting for a good big man the knicks on the other hand have one in willis reed plus a set of good guards and forwards to play with him dick mcguires problem is how to find the right combination with so much talent available the rest of the league including oscar robertson looks like nothing more than loyal opposition of nba players per centare negroes t wo los angeles businessmen are living proof that horatio algers kind of ragstoriches success is far from becoming a matter of the past richard d allen and his partner warren d gray didnt exactly start out in rags but with only in savings between them and within the incredibly short time of six years they built a business that today is grossing million a year both consider this only the beginning for they project that by their american tape duplicating co will have boosted its annual gross income to million atd as the firm has been dubbed produces thousands of stereo prerecorded tapes from masters supplied by record companies its brochures state that it can meet any reasonable deadline in reproducing highest quality tape in any quantity among the dozens of services performed by atd is the recording of music in the firms own studios for a mail order tape club numbering members nationally it also is involved in music publishing most of its income however comes from the reproduction of educational and training tapes for industry since more and more large companies are using audio tapes rather than the traditional bulletins to instnict their sales forces atd has become a significant supplier of a rapidly increasing market much of atds success is due to its founders inisiness aeuinen in when allen and irav were dtaiied a soihk hank loan they de eided to go ahead and launch their enturo with the sotm each had savetl they invisted in three duplicating machines and purchased their supplies on credit by working shifts ranging up to hours they wre able to fill in orders during the first month to finance the companys daytoday opctation they formd tin mail order

foresee becoming a business as large as any other we as negroes must compete with goods and services for all people never limit yourself never limit the market never limit the product avoid limited goals o ne of the best ways to learn about business is through experience this is the path richard allen and warren gray followed before launching an enterprise of their own allen who is credited with being the brains behind the organization was initiated early in his native indianapolis where he helped his father operate a bootleg taxicab company a hotel a live chicken market and a moving business following an unsuccessful semester at indiana university the yearold future executive moved to the watts section of los angeles where he lived with his sister and her family in a housing project to earn his way allen managed a health club for a man who also was road manager for a bigname orchestra while the owner was away on one of his frequent trips the enterprising young man opened an adjoining cafe moved himself into a back room and extended the clidjs operating hours from to hours a day the number of clients soared when the ovvmer returned allen asked for a share of the business and was refused indignant at such ingratitude allen quit and entered los angeles city college electronics alwavs had been richards hobby so he switched from college to a technical school later dropping out to work as a quality control expert for concertone co manufacturer of tape recorders after two years of onthejob training he graduated to engineering drafting and mechanical designing affable and eager to learn allen made a lot of friends one was russ molloy a white executive at the nearby bel canto corp manufacturers of prerecorded tape molloy hired llen to be their engineer it was in at bel canto that he met warren gray a former bus driver who was working as a shipping clerk wliile attending a business college by allen controlled the companys technical operations and gray knew all the salesmen prices and practices wlien bel canto subsequently was purchased by thomasramowoolridge corp trw and moved to columbus ohio allen went along to help set up the new jiant while gray remained in los ngelcs and started a recording business of his ovvti allen found the midwest disappointing and gray who had lost in his business venture later returned to the firm as western regional sales manager on one of allens trips back to the west he and gray decided to merge ideas observing we were only being paid a small percentage of what our abilities reflected they decided to apply what they had learned to an operation of their own in which they could benefit fully theyve been making it work ever since as two negroes who learned the complex games of finance they are concerned with others following their example we want to leave enough so that the next generation wont have to bust their backs says allen it must start with us in this generation i t was the end of one of the greatest opening night performances broadway ev er had cxpericnced finally the ovation died down somewhat and pearl bailey her cheeks wet with tears gestured for the orchestra to start playing the encore the audience had demanded so vociferously hello dolly well hello dolly she began in that w arm bluesy voice of hers the chorus behind her wanted to join in but she hushed them down vvdiile continuing alone why became obvious as she reached the end of the verse without warning she changed the words to suit her own emotions at that moment when i look above fellas all i feel is love fellas dollyll never go away again thats what makes the new version of hello dolly now playing at the st james theatre in new york city so different from the previous five broadway productions of the hit musical explained pearl on opening night to her enraptured audience were not doing a show at all just love thats all whien pearl bailey plays dolly there is a magic in the air that works on everybody little old ladies as well as hippies diplomats as well as journalists new yorks dreaded drama critics whose verdicts make or break a show surrendered without reservations and agreed that pearl cab and the rest of the talented cast had changed a show that had been around for four years into a brand new hit that will run on broadway as long as the new dolly wants the show still uses the same book by michael stewart based on thornton wilders the matchmaker the same score by jerr herman and the same choreography by gower champion restaged by lucia victor but this version of dolly has an additional something maybe its soulnot simply because all the members of the cast are negroes although it helps but all the characters from the leads to the smallest bit parts arc portrayed with unusual depth zest andyeslove david merrick broadways most successful producer admitted it himself after the preliminarv opening in washington d c when he exclaimed i looked for the right cast for dolly for four years and finally i e found it and at the broadway premiere composer jerr herman sat in the theater with tears in his eyes too stunned to express in words the transformation his own music and ivrics had underuone in the hands of this excellent cast the iart ol dolly gallagher levi the meddling matchmaking new york widow who decides to rejoin the human race and find a man for herself is such a perfect vehicle for pearl bailey that it is difficult to determine u here dolly ends and pearlie mae begins in her first number dolly explains ive always been a woman who arranges thingsfurniture daffodils and lives and during the shows reeortlbreaking tr ont in washington pearlor dollyeven arranged for president and mrs johnson to see the shovv early one morning pearl felt an urge to write the president and give him her vitws on the problems of the world she did and a few days later the president and the first lady not only showed up at the national theater for the second half of a saturday matinee but even joined the cast onstage for curtain calls after thanking each member personally quite a compliment but pearl bailey was equally touched by a tribute sh had received a few weeks earlier from admirers of a far different social stratuma group of flower children the day before the big peace march on the pentagon she had run into them at the lincoln memorial w here she had gone to reminisce about her washington childhood she established an almost mystical rapport w ith the youngsters and helped get them standing room tickets for that evenings show t the end of the performance the teenagers quietly walked down the aisle to the stage and handed little bouquets of yellow daisies to pearl who was deeply moved by the gesture one of th hippies explained afterwards but you wtre never rtcfing and that savs pearl is the nicest compliment i ever got if tl lere s a lot of dolly levi in pearl bailev there also is as much of pearl in dolly as lucia victor would permit theres the throaty rich voice the xaudeville performers expressive gestures and showstopping dance numbers theres an extra child here and honey there and little asides like hold on old girl littered during a strenuous dance number and in that fabulous homecoming scene that is the climax of the show when dolly gathers up the train of her red beaded gown and starts a hipswaying grind across the stage apron while the chorus sings hello dolly audience response reaches riot proportions if pearl is tpecast as dolly so is cab calloway as horace vandergclder the stingx yonkers halfamillionaire dolly decides to trap for herself for ab hello dolly means a theater comeback after eight years of singing engagements all over the xvorld and he finds it very exciting jab is one of the fexv members of the cast xvho saxv one of the prex ions broadxvay productions of dolly and he jiroudly points out that his andergeldcr is not gray like the others wxrc on the contrary cabs rich friendless and mean merchant is a color fill distinctive character a perfect sparring partner to pearls dolly one of the persons most impressed with cabs performance is his yearold daughter chris who makes her broadway debut in the role of minnie fay a kooky little shop girl cab is pretty proud of his talented daughter too who comes across as an excellent comedienne many others in tlie cast deserve special credit emily yancy scores a personal triumph as mrs molloy the milliner emily whom one critic calls one of the most beautiful girls since lena home was leslie uggams standby in halleluiah baby but never had a chance to perform before an audience jack crowder who brings a fresh mascidinity to the role of the intimidated clerk cornelius haekl starred in the fantasticks oftbroadway and has had extensive television and stage experience winston dewitt hemsley is a laughgetter as barnaby tucker mabel king is a hilarious emestina and sherri peaches brewers whining ermengarde is not easily forgotten when it was first announced that david nferrick was planning an allnegro version of hello dolly many people questioned his motives most were the socalled white liberals who felt this would be a relapse to the allnegro shows of an earlier lessenlightened era cynics contended it was just a gimmick to attract people who had already seen the show and the womens national democratic club voted down a proposal to engage the show for a benefit because the cast was segregated criticism died down quickly however as soon as the new production was unveiled merricks initiative was hailed as a brilliant stroke of showmanship critic clive barnes of the new york times went one step further admitting in his review that he had gone to the opening prejudiced against the show because it sounded too much like blackbirds of and all too patronizing for words he went on to say that he was completely won over by pearl and cab and the rest of the brilliant cast adding maybe black_power is what some of the other musicals need among the performers themselves viewpoints differ pearl bailey does not want the racial angle played up and refuses to discuss the issue but jack crowder is very outspoken why is there so much discussion any time negroes work he asks he lauds david merrick for doing dolly in living color hut stresses that this was done without sacrificing the book every character is valid as a slice of black society in early new york he contends isnt it unrealistic for people to be asked to believe that all negroes do nothing but crusade and protest for chris calloway though the show is a fomi of demonstration protected by her fathers fame the freckled redhead says she was largely unconcerned about social and racial issues in the past i was just cruising along she explains but you have to take a stand these days this is her way of doing it to those who object to an allncgro dolly one can only say go and see it youll become so in olved with the characters as human beings youll leave the theater in love with the world you may s afety is a key word in the automobile industry this year as detroit automakers broaden sights to include a

outdrive outdazzle and outsell their competitors but their predecessors from as vvell the big question is whether americans will buy the safer autos and not to be overlooked is the problem of inflation like everything else in new cars will cost more money d reams of becoming rich are not uncommon to the people who spend their lives scratching the earth searching for rough diamonds in the liigh mountains of the southern africa country lesotho however for a family such as that of petrus ramoboa the chances for riches were always much slimmer than the dreams the ramoboas who live in the village of letengla terai vvork a land plot so small that the government demands only a year for rent and in all of lesotho diamond production is a mere carats each year thus when the ramoboas carat find of a few years ago brought them a little over xk they thought their dreams had been fulfilled but after four hours of sieving soil one morning last may ernestine ramoboa was about to stop for a rest when a large white stone in her words just rolled out she remembers that it looked ery much like a piece of dirty glass broken off at each end but what mrs ramoboa had found was a carat diamondthe seventh largest in the world and worth more than million after being cut and polished petrus ramoboa was on a fixeday journey to lesothos capital maseru trdng to sell smaller stones when his wife made the big find except for her brothers mrs ramoboa told no one i showed it to my brothers she says and then i vvtapped it in a kerchief put it in my pocket and sealed my pocket with a safety pin when petrus returned home the pair lost no time in getting back to the diamond buyers office in maseru they walked for four days through the mountains until they came to a town xvhere buses enroute to the capital stopped in maseru an astonished buyer examined the diamond but made no offer to buy perhaps he couldnt afford so huge a stone news of the ramoboa find soon reached the goveniment and officials became concerned that the couple might take the first offer and not receive the stones full worth arrangements were made for a group of bankers to receix e sealed bids the highest offer came from a south mrican buyer after taxes and sharing with three partners xvho also xvorked their small plot the ramoboas had about to take home which made them one of the richest couples in all of lesotho e xpensive diamonds dont stand still it was only a short time before the south african buyer sold the ramoboa diamond to a dutch colleague who in turn sold it to harry winston one of new yorks major jewelers for a whopping winston hearing that the ramoboas were eager to see what would happen to the stone invited them and their yearold daughter maria to come to new york as his guests he also arranged for the daughter who has been deaf and crippled since age five to see physical rehabilitation specialist dr howiird rusk of new york university medical center after taking a single engine plane from maseru to johannesburg south africa the ramoboas jetted to london then to new york terrified at first by the thought of flying such a long distance they soon settled down and enjoyed the trip at new york s kennedy airport they were greeted by albert mohale lesothos ambassador to the united states and mooki molapo first secretary at lesothos washington embassy who was assigned as the couples interpreter then began a whirlwind u s tour tlie ramoboas and the interpreter at the expense of winston occupied a aday executive suite in new yorks summit hotel and spent the following days shuttling through interviews visiting dr rusk with their daughter sightseeing and shopping winston provided a chauffeured limousine and his public relations director jill ciraldo new york and an entire new world vvere for the moment theirsa striking contrast to life in tiny lesotho an independent enclave in south africa the day after their arrival in new york the ramoboas appeared at a press conference called by harry winston to show the vvorld their find petrus ramoboa faced the lights with a broad smile and wide eyes in a black suit white shirt and rep tie he looked quite american except for the koho he vvore around his shoulders and the coneshaped straw mokorotlo perched on his head his wife also wore a koho over her dress and mokorotlo over a white fur hat tlirough an interpreter they told newsmen all about themselves and their big find then the ramoboas went on a clothesbuying spree at rogers peet fifth avenue store ramoboa purchased a number of fashionable items one was a country coat with a racoon collar which he put on immediately and seldom parted with during his stay in the u s for their shopping mrs ramoboa and maria braved the nish hour crowds at alexanders bought of dresses coats and shoes mini skirts didnt exactly turn the ramoboas on but they became temporarily addictevl to television one of the many western luxuries lesothos citizens are without i would be extremely happy to have a television said mrs ramoboa but in a moments reflection noted that it might interfere with her work st patricks cathedral the nations largest catholic church provided one of the familys biggest thrills about per cent of lesothos population is christian and the ramoboas are among the per cent of their countrymen who are roman catholic another highlight of the trip was the ramoboas visit to washington d c where they met vicepresident hubert h humphrey and participated in a press conference at the smithsonian institution where the diamond was placed on view before being cut into about stones but nothing about the trip was more meaningful to ernestine and petrus ramoboa than to learn that their daughter should be able to do well in either clerical or vocational school in spite of her handicap dr rusk and his team concluded that she would alwavs have troidle with her gait caused by muscle tightening following an infection she had as a little girl but noted that a hearing aid in one ear would probably be helpful upon returning home the ramoboas celebrated with relatives and friends by slaughtering an ox and brewing beer they had no trouble slipping back into their own culture after enjoying their visit to an alien one in examining the lesotho diamond harry winston discovered that the stone at some time in its geological history was larger than it is now had its two ends not been sheared off it probably would have weighed around carats making it the second largest ever found altliough wealthier than before making their find the ramoboas still have an unfilled dream they would hke to find the otlier two missing diamond pieces t hough snow might still be on the ground with the promise of mueh more to eome

elections of stokes and hatcher proved conclusively that political victory of a determined minorih is the possible the year also was the year in which it became possible for a negro tliurgood marshall to be appointed to the u s supreme court the yeiu an allwhite mississippi jury in an unprecedented move found seven white men guilty of conspiracy in the murders of three civil_rights workers and the year it became legal for black and white partners to unite in marriage anywhere in this land as a result of the iremarshall u s supreme courts unanimous ruling that there can be no doubt that

such integrated gatherings has culminated in utter rejection such was the mood at the black_power conference held in july in newark n j some soo delegatesincluding such divtrse personages as physicists and harlem streetcorner nationalistsconducted workshops aimed towards black control of black communities the principle issue raised at the conference chaired by dr nathan wright episcopal diocese of newarks urban department director was the dev clopment of the black community on sev tl al lev els besolutions dealing with the use of political power included one to recall mayor hugh

as chairman of the house education and labor committee two months earlier congress based its action on powells defiance of new york courts in a defamation case and his alleged misuse of congressional funds tlie harlem democrat who in civil_rights l ess pressure for new cival rights laws and less emphasis on racial integration were persistent themes during the negros basic rights had been vvtitten into law enforcement was the problem now better housing had come to be regarded by many as perhaps more important for negroes than integrated housingand more achievable open housing legislation many felt primarity would help middleclass negroes and not the vast numlcftjhcgroes who couldnt afford to move into suburbs or even into many urban white neighborhoods better schools were also coming to be viewed as of more immediate value to negroes than integrated schools a guaranteed minimum income was being talked about more widely as well as the idea of a socalled marshall plan for negroes the increased emphasis on improving the situation of the negro within his own neighborhood was an extension of the black_power movement launched in the summer and vigorously championed by h rap brown who last may replaced stokely carmichael as chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee many black_powerites felt the liberation of negroes in the united states lav in group action that they must close ranks before they could bargain effectively in the open society meanwhile as an aftermath of the oldfashioned civil_rights movement an allwhite jury of sev en women and five men top right found seven white mississippi men guilty of conspiracy in the murders of three civil_rights workers michael schwemer andrew goodmim and james chaney the murders took place in philadelphia miss at the outset of the mississippi summer project this marked the first time in that states history that a white person has been convicted of a major civil_rights crime the guilty included cecil price in

with a mind to defeat president johnson in and bring to an end the american presence in viet nam the convention drawing card included dr martin_luther_king and dr benjamin spock and its hopes centered around a renewal of blackwhite alliances but the fireworks vvere provided by the tiny group of nationalistbent militants who gained national notoriety as the black caucus the convention did if nothing else reflect that the nations new left is as dividedraciallyas the rest of the nation o ne of the highlights of the picture in education was the election of mrs ehzabeth d koontz a teacher of retarded children in salisbury n c as the first negro president of the national education assn the nations largest a million members and most powerful teacher organizations equally noteworthy were recommendations from the u s civil_rights commission that the federal government withdraw tax benefits from private allwhite schools established in the south as a result of public school desegregation the commission also recommended legislation providing for civil and criminal action in cases where negro students attending prev iously allwhite schools are harassed or intimidated under the proposed legislation negro cliildren and their parents could bring civil action for injunctive relief and damages against individuals who harass or intimidate them because of enrollment in a desegregated school such intimidation whether violent or economic should be a federal crime the commission declared it also criticized the u s office of education for allowing a majority of the school districts in alabama georgia louisiana mississippi and south carolina to continue receiving federal aid while failing to comply with guidelines it adopted under the civil_rights act these recommendations and criticisms followed up the commissions report racial isolation in the public schools which found that racial isolation is intense and growing worse negro children suffer serious harm when they are educated in racially segregated schools whatever the origin of the segregation white children educated in allwhite schools also are harmed and frequently are illprepared to live in a world of people from diverse social economic and cultural backgrounds compensatory programs to improve ghetto education by providing additional funds and special services were largely ineffective and school desegregation remedies have been devised which will improve the quality of education for all children t o those searching for work six years of recordbreaking economic expansion have brought small rewards negroes hav e inched ahead to better jobs higher wages and lower employment but so have whites thus negroes today are just as far behind as in the early s when promises of equal opportunity and the great society were unwrapped to build their hopesand their frustrations they still account for about per cent of the civilian labor force but suffer more than per cent of the nations unemployment the negro jobless rate dropped from per cent in to per cent in the second quarter of but tlie white rate has fallen just as fast and the twotoone ratio of negro to white joblessness persists for the negro teenager the competitive situation has actually worsened non white teenage unemployment was high in at per cent but in it was evtn higher at per cent in the second quarter meanwhile white rates have fallen from per cent to per cent since conventional unemployment figures include all persons who are not working but actively looking for a job labor experts say they understate unemployment among negroes particularly those in big city ghettos even on this limited basis the city slums have an unemployment rate three times the national average but many ghetto m ajor

inequalities resulting from de facto segregation must be remedied and ordered these changes in washington schools free busing for negroes in overcrowded schools who want to attend underpopulated schools in white areas elimination of optional zones giving pupils a choice of schools abolition of the track system of assigning pupils to certain courses of study on basis of aptitude tests and substantial integration of faculties as well as of student bodies washington officials were ordered to consider the advisability of educational parks and other integration devices which would in

i join you my black brotliers in america in mourning the tragic loss of a truly outstanding human being leader and brother of all mankind dr martin_luther_king jr am jamaican by birth and nationality therefore i also express the grief of my countiymen for although he was an honorary citizen of our country tins was not an adequate honor to this human phenomenon white america is responsible for his death during his lifetime it vilified him and heeded not his plea but now that it has crucified him it eulogizes him with empty words but do not hate tlie white man i pity him for he has no soul amidst his material wealth there is spiritual poverty the riots and arsons in your cities are regrettable but justified i wish the victim would understand this a plant never grows except seeds are sewn tile seeds which produced tlic tree which dr_king fought so vigorously to kill and consequently the riots were seasoned with the introduction of slavery i think i am correct for there have been bloody slave rebellions in the history of my island the murder of martin_luther_king was a senseless and brutal crime it was worse than a crime it was a stupidity it can benefit only the white and colored extremists who beheve in force and who foment riots and bloodshed by their beliefs it is sad tliat once againas so often in historythe good christian man of ideals and principles seeking solutions to bitter controversies by nonviolent metliods should have fallen a victim to violence we can only hope that the reaction to this crime will not itself produce more crime and make racial

clothing they stole it and wore it as a child i thought the clothing was lovely and lingered over the purple shoes with crimson soles or crimson linings and my only feelings about little black sambo

fearful in many places that it takes the persistent pressure of men like mr chambers to get anything done as a nvhite an american and a christian i am appalled at the lack of progress in bringing about equal rights for all persons russell r morgan jil oshkosh wis sidney no neuter s a new subscriber i was impressed with the april article on sidney poiticr and would like to enter a few yes but rejoinders agreed with the major ixints but not with all the details in guess whos coming to dinner i found myself resenting somewhat the fact that poitier had to be the absolute ly impossibly great distinguished negro scientistphysician in order to be worthy to marry the bite girl he could not be just a nice promising kid of her age that was wrong emphasis from my point of view then there was the question of sexual reticence she was willing he wasnt again a part of the nobility image if we are willing to accept it as such he was a good deal older he was interested in marriage not quick conquest he couldnt believe that her family would accept him or that liis family would accept her good points wcre made when his family proved more difficult to persuade than hers he never seemed neuter to me nor to the women in the audience i am sure whatever their race i saw the film in phoenix ariz and there was never any question that poitier had the sympathy of the audience at all times in the white suburbs of chicago i hear only of the lines of people waiting to see the picture many of us who are wdiitc feel sorry and guilty about the injustices the negro has suffered for years but i am only and i have been able to work on the problem for my adult years please dont make it too bard for those of us who w ant to belli and who honestly will do our best to overcome our clumsiness once wc know what wc can do and poitier movieswhile not yet the whole answerare moving in the right direction russell bletzer deerfield ill while mr sanders reporting was objective his extensive quotation from clifford masons misguided criticism without specific rebuttal tended to create an impression that mr masons arguments could not be ansavered and that mr poitier should be guided by them this i feel would be a pity for both the interests of the negro and cinematographic art accordingly i should like to attempt an answer as a person of humane concern i feel the utmost sympathy for mr masons desire to have the black screen image one of pride and dignity but i have no sympathy with his racial bigotry which parades itself as a sense of dignity and identity i cannot however respect mr masons racist views on motion picture criticism nor his lackadaisical confusion of mr poitier with his screen roles his insufferable contention that mr poiticr is a white mans nigger because he accepts a role in which the character he plays holds the hat of the character played by james garner makes even less sense than it would to argue that rod steiger is a southern cracker because he plays one in heat of the nifiht it makes less sense because bod steiger was at least playing such a role mr poiticr was not playing stepin fetchit his role in duel at diablo was socially realistic and not undignified under the circumstances what concerns me more howcver is the kind of criticism mr mason directs at lilies of the field and a patch of blue w inch he argues exhibit a schizophrenic flight from identity and historical fact because mr poitier is nice to white people tlnis becoming a black version of the man in uie gray flannel suit taking on white problems and a white mans sense of whats wrong with the world the moral purbliiidness of his view lies in his assumption that to be humane is a betrayal of racial identity and dignity when extended to persons with different skin pigmentationa view he shares with the ku klux klan and george wallace i suspect that the real reason white america loves sidney poiticr so is because like all great actors he projtcts a human warmth and dignity which transcends the triviality of skin color and in doing so is making a unique contribution to solving the white side of the negro problem i say therefore by all means let him do whatever he wishes and can to uplift the spirit and image of his black brothers but do not disparage or discourage him in what he is also doing to educate mr charlie and if he stands alone among negro actors in making millions of white americans share the love of white youngsters for a dcdicatckl teacher whose skin happens to be black with no more concern than if his hair were red or his sckks green then let him work his magic so that one day what is now only a screen fantasy may become an everyday reality lee gladden associate professor of psychology and philosophy riverside city college

puzzled by bible for some time i have lecn puzzled about information in the bible all the pictures are white and i believe are done by wiiite artists i studied the bible at moody bible inst and all the instructors were white when i attended in and as a former member of a church sunday school i found most of the teachers had very little knowledge of tlic bible and were just christian believers who accepted what was passed on to tliem as facts the christian groups i studied with were taught mostly by people who attended moody bible school at one time or another so feel that their knowledge came from a white man whose mind could have been closed to the tnith i learned at moody bible school that cod cursed ham for laughing at his dnink father and that as a result of the curse black people came from ham cod put the white man here to rule the black man i quit because couldnt go along w ith that now i would like to know if one of our black writers or historians could do research on king james the one who revised the bible i would like to know was he a racist wils he suppostd to le a good man vith very little fault who gave him the authority to revise the bible and why what hapiened to the bfks that wtre left out of his revised version and why did he leave them out you might recommend that i go to afroamerican history places i wish i could but being a mother of four children i am unable to go to the various ilaces for information but i feel should take my children to sunday school bccause i do believe in cod and want my children to grow up to ixjlieve in cod but i resent the picture cards they receive in primary sunday school i would like to advocate doing away with all the pictures in the bible and give our children a chance to think clearly and not to be brain washcd

the serj personal stor bigilining on page lena long famous as a singer was in hollood as the fulfillment of a longtime dream she was rehearsing her starring role as the wife of richard widmark in the moie patch how do we know it was a longtime dream easy we just went back to the first time lena appeared on an ebony cocr it was the th issue of ebony the date was march and faithful ebony readers will remember that it was the first full color cover in ebonys history lena was in hollywood at that time too she was making a movie called till the clouds roil by with young singers judy garland and frank sinatra and songanddanceman johnson she had already starred in the musical cabin in the sky and she was destined to appear as a singer in many other musicals throughout the years but even then she said that she really wanted to be an actress im very gratified that people accept my singing but thats fnistration too i really wanted to be an actress its easier for a colored person to be a

for it on your newsstand i dont want to talk about it he kept mumbling as if even i the briefest mention of the tragedy would intensify his pain huge pro footballer rosey grier was near tears he had teamed with exolympic champ rafer johnson and others to subdue the man later accused of killing sen robert f kennedy it had been a heroic act but now stricken with the numbness of grief he could not talk about it that numbness that sense of grief gripped other negroes across tlie country after the senators assassination only yesterday or so it seemed an assassins bullet had stilled the lyrical eloquence of dr martin_luther_king only day before yesterday violent death had ended the presidential promise of john f kennedy and now bobby a stout black woman collapsed before his coffin in new york sobbing our friend is gone oh jesus he is gone jesus jesus like the distraught woman many negroes saw kennedys death as the last shred of hope wrenched from the land he had been the knight in shining armor who would free them of their misery they had revealed their faith in him variously before his death bob kennedys white but alright proclaimed a crayoned window sign in omahas negro section although not yet a presidential candidate in february when he strolled through harlem shaking hands and signing autographs supporters urged him to make it in as if dissuading him from waiting until negroes in los angeless watts area promised they would help get him elected others in columbus ohio enthusiastically delayed his motorcade three hours some say robert kennedy was popular with negroes because of the tremendous admiration they had for his brother others say the younger man was a worthy recipient of their affection in his own right in any case it was his public career which almost totally meshed with the great civil_rights battles of the early sthe turbulent years of the sitins freedom rides and campus confrontations when kennedy became attorney general in many doubted he had any personal commitment to racial equality and it was true by his own admission that he had come to this interest late i wont say i stayed awake nights worrying about civil_rights before i became attorney general he once confided yet despite his tardiness kennedy brought to the racial wars the passion and conviction of an llthhour convert anxious to overcome the sometimedisadvantages of wealth a sheltered upbringing and whiteness he was disdainful of southerners who in effect restricted negroes to bootblacking then used this condition of semiservitude to verify their unreadiness for full citizenship he was contemptuous of northerners who talked integration but didnt lie itnewspaper editors for instance who preached civil_rights but belonged to racially restricted clubs and sent their children to lilywhite schools neither robert nor john kennedy succeeded in substantially enlarging the body of civilrights legislation but they fostered the atmosphere of honest concern it needed to breathe in the younger brothers intentions became very clear on may when he spoke at law day exercises at the university of georgia he told the audience that racial discrimination was national in scope in fact i found when i came to the department of justice that i need look no further to find evidence of this he continued i found that very few negroes were employed above a custodial level there were lawyers working in the department of justice in washington and only of them were negroes at the same moment the lawyers of the department of justice were bringing legal action to end discrimination that same discrimination was being practiced within the department itself kennedy went on to say at a recent review for the visiting leader of a new african state there was only one negro in the guard of honor at the bureau of the budget negroes were used only for custodial work you may ask will we enforce the civil_rights statutes the answer is yes we will as the federal governments chief strategist in some of the most dramatic collisions with state power since the civil war kennedy was uniquely situated to translate his youthful idealism into action during the same month of his georgia speech he demonstrated his determination when a mob of angry whites milled outside the first baptist church in montgomery ala while the rev ralph d abernathy introduced freedom riders to the audience inside the rev dr martin_luther_king telelhoned kennedy from the church to say he feared for the negroes safety but prior to that call the attorney general had already persuaded gov john patterson to declare martial law tear of mississippi delta cotton plantations in may gave rfk firsthand knowledge of destitute starving families he asked one boy what did you have for breakfast molasses for supper molasses for lunch dont have no lunch child answered robert f kennedy confiatfccf in montgomery he also dispatched us marshals to protect the freedom riders and restrain the whites national guardsmen escorted the negroes home early the next day and kennedy ordered more marshals into alabama because as he explained he was not satisfied with the situation his reliance on us marshals turned out to be an honest miscalculation however in his handling of the september riot over the admission of james meredith to the university of mississippi the marshals could not control the mob and before troops could move in two men were killed and other persons were injured kennedy later explained lie had tried to avoid a direct armed clash between us soldiers and sheriffs and other mississippi citizens he thought he had resolved the problem in long conversations with gov ross barnett when the governor promised to maintain order but it was a promise never fulfilled the same disappointment followed earnest eonversations kennedy had with gov george c wallace two months before the desegregation of the university of alabama in june the two had discussed the possibility of violence on the campus but the governor contributed to that possibility with his stand in the schoolhouse door to keep negro students vivian malone and james hood from enrolling fortunately kennedy had learned much from his university of mississippi involvement this time he sent both us marshals and federalized alabama national guardsmen to the university of alabama campus and forced gov wallace to stand aside the attorney general sharpened his civil_rights skill by serving as the intermediary who brought two warring factions together after violence broke out in birmingham ala in he also lersuaded the labor movement to put up in bail money for hundreds of jailed negroes about demonstrators led by the rev dr martin_luther_king had been arrested over a fiveweek period mostly on charges of parading without a permit appeal bonds for the defendants ranged from k to and the one negro bondsman in townthe only one who would bail out the defendantshad run out of collateral while demonstrators were still in jail kennedy sent two aides burke marshall and louis f oberdorfer to negotiate a peaceful settlement the next moniing the was wired to birmingham and the negro bondsman had the collateral he needed to wtite the rest of the bonds such efforts contributed to kennedys unpopularity among southern whites on the other hand many negroes criticized him for moving too slowly on civil_rights enforcement thus his civil_rights involvement was for him at times a painful education in race relations this fact was revealed graphically when he j met in his new york apartment in after the birmingham crisis with a group assembled by author james baldwin the attorney general had come recalls one of the participants as if to chat with a group of polished and wellheeled negroes anxious to applaud his w ork in civil_rights but the illusion was j shortlived introductory remarks came from yearold new i orleans core chairman jerome smith who had been beaten and jailed perhaps remembering that kennedy in the spring of had urged a cooling off period on freedom rides the youngster said first off mr kennedy i want you to understand i dont care anything about you or your brother then he proceeded to blast the kennedys for failing to give beleaguered negroes adequate protection in the south the attorney general tried to answcr his young antagonist but was interrupted repeatedly finally he pleaded to be heard okay snapped the exfreedom rider but this time say something that means something so far you havent said a thing the meeting had been scheduled for two hours it broke up after a fourhour outpouring of anger disappointment and impatience nrmation of newlyappointed appeals court judge thurgood marsliall and other commendable appointments in june kennedy by now a senator from new york made a whirlwind tour of south africa and received a cold shoulder from the south african government which had suggested his visit might have been intended as a publicity stunt a huildup for a future presidential election undaunted kennedy in a speech at the university of natal in durban predicted that unless south africa modified its policy of strict racial segregation there is going to he a major crisis not only in africa but throughout the world to the young people of a nation whose name is synonymous with racism he spelled out the evils of slavery slaughter and starvation that reflect the imperfection of human justice the inadeuacy of human compassion our lack of sensibility towards the suffering of our fellows in possibly the most eloquent speech of his career lie invited them to share the challenge of changing things saying it is a revolutionary world which we live in and this generation at home and around the world lias had thnist upon it a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived some hcliexe there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the worlds ills yet many of the worlds great moxements of thought and action ha e flowed from the work of a single man each time a man stands for an ideal or acts to impro e the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance then immediately after returning to the us he wrote in a national magazine everything that is now said about the negro was said about the irish catholics tliey were useless they were worthless they couldnt learn anything why did they have to settle here why dont we see if we cant get boats and send them hack to ireland they obviously arent equipped for education and they certainly can ne er rule even if the analogy was not precisely one to one between lotato fanners and exslaes kennedy nevertheless revealed he had more than just an intellectual grasp of racial discrimination diile he repeatedly deplored the racial rebellions wliich swept the country during the closing years of his tooshort career he reminded americans history offers cold comfort to those who think grievances and despair can he subdued by force to understand is not to permit but to fail to understand is the surest guarantee of mounting strife after the watts rebellion in august kennedy warned that there was no point in telling negroes to obey the law because to many of them the law is the enemy he saw the cities and the urban ghetto as the most urgent domestic problem to face this nation since the civil war and the major political crisis of the net ten years acting out of this coiiviction he criticized president johnson in march for not responding relevantly to the report of the presidents commission on civil disorders kerner commission with an immediate program for action theres no sense of emergency from the president kennedy complained i was disappointed that after last summers trouble the only steps taken by the president were appointment of a commission and a day of prayer while divine guidance was welcome national leadership was the more pressing need to kennedy several areas required immediate attention the nations public assistance services had stripped the poor of their dignit and treated them as a nation apart the nations public education needed money but there also had to be a drastic change in the institutional environment the nations poverty program begged solution in programs of community development tlie overriding task as kennedy saw it was to bring not just individual residents hut the entire community into the mainstream of american life in other words the people of the ghetto had to he helped in their efforts at sclfsufficienev and control over their destinies new communitv institutions had to be created that local residents could control and through which they could express their wishes this was the familiar strategy of the young new left radicals with their emphasis on participatory democracy that is the participation of each citizen in public decisions which determine his destiny this was also a way of eliminating the empathy gap between power structures and the people controlled by power kennedy experimented with these ideas in the bcdfordstiiyvesant section of brooklyn here in the nations second largest negro ghetto he brought local black leaders together with business political and academic figures to establish a community development corporation and provide capital investment and technical assistance in congress meanwhile he introduced bills providing tax and other incentives for private enterprise to build plants in ghettos and also for construction of lowcost housing the senators nagging concern for the poor lay behind his support of the poor peoples march on washington in march he reportedly was also counting on the campaign to bolster his political strength at the democratic party convention in chicago with his full approval mr kennedys closest political lieutenants passed the word to give the poor army campaign in washington all the support its leader dr martin_luther_king requested but the murder of dr_king cut short their budding alliance the democratic presidential candidate was campaigning in indianapolis on the day of the king assassination two months and a day before he himself was fatally wounded me was addressing a predominantlynegro crowd years of public service had etched his boyish face with deep lines grey flecked his light brown tousled hair his eves which since his brothers assassination flashed only occasionally with the joy of his youth were set in deep furrows momentarily he was lost in his thoughts then he said for those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act i can only say that i feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling a member of my family was killed but he was killed by a white man then in a burst of prophecy reminiscent of dr_kings premonitions of death robert francis kennedy ended solemnly it is not the end of violence it is not the end of lawlessness it is not the end of disorder let us dedicate ourselves to what tlie greeks wrote so many years ago to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world let us dedicate ourselves to that and say a prayer for our country and our people they had come to her modest home to celebrate their rejection of white cultural domination by walking out of a chicago arts conference these black artists of a fresh moldboth the ratherwellknown and the yettobeheardfromcame crowding into her tiny living room bearded bristling beneath their naturals and intent here a graying novelist of some note there a new york dancer who had choreographed a ballet about a junkie a towering painter who spoke for a revolutionary group whose name was that of a snake a coming playwright with burning eyes set within a boyish face and a host of gestating poets but all united in their defiance of old standards and a determination to strike out toward a black aesthetic as they pressed against the booklined walls of the little room talkingallatonce their hostess rummaged about her even smaller kitchen trying to brew enough coffee for her instant guests and softly apologizing that she hadnt more in the house to offer this was not an unlikely nor uncommon role for gwendolyn brooks to play certainly other artists would be drawn to her as one of the leading writers of the age a woman poet whose work has been said to possess a simple beauty that is almost unbearable it was in keeping with the official honors that have come her way over many yearsonly negro ever to win a pulitzer prize in any category for poetry in twice a guggenheim fellow in and winner of a creative writing award from the american academy of arts and letters in holder of honorary doctorates and citations and this year named successor to the late carl sandburg as poet laureate of illinois another first and only for a black writer she had been one of the very few of her race to make even a slight imprint on that vaguely defined but alltoopowerful entity called the poetic establishment an institution so exclusive and systematically racist that critic karl shapiro has referred to poetry as the most lilywhite of the arts and yet there was an element of irony in the fact that these young black artists driven toward the horizons of militance had sought out gwendolyn brooks on their night of personal triumph it was the same cultural establishment which had singled her out for a nodding deference from which they had declared their independence thus their visit was an impromptu and casually extended tribute that can only be understood in terms of the impact she has had and continues to have on others in a human way that complements her importance as a writer for behind her public image of extreme reserve this gentle woman of years has used her talents and influence to encourage the young and the aspiring in all quietness and without regard to self n associate and friend of longstanding explains until recently when she began teaching gwen neer had any money though she had the recognition but what little she has gotten she has given away when black writers convened this spring at madison wis she was the first to offer toward the setting up of a black academy frequently she has given little scholarships and awards to young writers in order that they might have the time in which to develop she has gone into her own purse to do this but it goes beyond that often she avoids establishment people who seek her out for recognition but she gives freely of her time to any young person who wants to write the time and the encouragement this is a rare thing her dedication and generosity are well known in the everexpanding circle of young black writers who attend the monthly fonims she conducts at her little brown and white bungalow on a treeshaded street around the corner from a nconspattcrcd thoroughfare on chicagos south side these fourhour sessions are freeofcharge and she eagerly proides the refreshments which are in reality a fidl meal that has been accepted in silent gratitude by more than one who otherwise might not have had enough to eat those who hae benefited from her help are wise enough to know that any expression of thanks would be embarrassing to her but readily admit to others she is cherished by all of us such respect and lovx on the part of the young whose searing vitality compels them to probe beneath the surface of things would be less substantial if it were not accompanied by a deep regard for her mind and the works she has produced it is far from being a matter of unthinking hero worship while many of them are impelled toward racial protest with literary expression as their instrument of release they know that she is in accord with their quest and wants them to chart their own artistic trajectories and they have seen through to the vibrant nugget of protest within the distinctie brooks writings fashioned with such verbal elegance and eloquence as one of her young scribes states it her writing might not be as loud as that of someone like leroi jones but she is the foundation on which a lot of black nnriters had to stand in order to get where they are her statements might seem quiet in a way but if you look closely youll see that she has been dealing with things the way they really are that she has had her knuckles on all the time that is whv we think of her as a bridge there might be many reasons why gwendolyn brooks does not jealously guard her singularity but instead seeks to share the joy ol her art with others most importantly though she wants to spare those who are just beginning some of the pain and misunderstanding she had to endure for there was no one to help her along the way no concerned teachers or sympathetic mentors today she can say in all assurance that her own long struggle to become a poet and to be acknowledged as such was aside from parental faor a private endeaor if the seed that was to bear such magnificent poetic fruit had roots it was in the aspirations of her parents da id and keziah brooks who came to chicago from topeka kan during the first decade of the century her mother a spry septuagenarian who still composes songs and storettes had bten an elementarv school teacher back in kansas her father who died in had hoped to become a physician but his finances were so limited that he could manage only one ear at fisk university yet he held to his dream of completing his schooling someday by studying parttime and working the dieam was soon shattered the only work he could find in chicago was as a janitor which paid too little money and left too little energy for things like education on june when gwendolyn elizabeth was bom the first of two children her mother had gone back to topeka to be with her own family during the event though she remained there but one month the poets earliest years often are erroneously linked to that city a biographical twist that causes miss brooks to remark laughingly i cant understand why my mother had to go back to kansas ruining my natiwty to tliis her mother replies if i had known that she was going to become so famous i would have made certain that she was bom in chicago as a former teacher her mother was quick to detect the first spark of talent in young gwendolyn and recalls wlien she was seven she had come home from school one day and was sitting in a little red chair by is patron of young black artists the bed writing something i looked to see what it was and she had written seven or eight rhymes of two lines each i said to her oh youre going to be a poet because i had never seen anything like that before after that she wrote constantly working up to erses of four lines when i saw that she was going to be a writer i gave her all the time she needed about the only thing she had to do around the house was the dinner dishes and her brother raymond never questioned it as a child the future writer also read omnivorously her mother who had gotten librarv cards for both children when they were about six remembers she would close the door to her little room and like to be to herself all the time either reading or writing i dont think i e er saw her at the dinner table without a book unless we had company though she knew it wasnt the thing to do she read so much that i had to make her go outside and play to rest the other children thought was making her stay inside and read but it was because she preferred books to anything mrs brooks had such confidence in her childs ability that she once challenged a fifthgrade teacher who gave her a poor grade on a set of sentences written as a vocabulary exercise storming over to the school she pointed out to the woman that a perfect grade was not expected because of the ink blots and illegible writing but as for the quality of the work she insisted no teacher coidd write any better sentences than these are the teacher then examined the paper more thoroughly and had to agree that the sentences were excellent the grade was changed for cwendolvn brooks herself the memories of childhood are steeped in warm reminiscences of the semiimpoverished but respectable life she shared with her parents in the brown frame twoflat wherc they liv ed in the heart of the south side black belt she recalls her fathers set of the harvard classiesy which he had proudly purchased even before marriage and the way he used to read to the children from them and other books those books still stand in their careiully polished case in that house where her mother continues to reside my father loved education and culture miss brooks savs of him he never wanted to be a janitor or porter or anything like that but that was the best he could do at the time but he used to recite to us sing little songs he was a great influence on my interest in reading she also remembers the way her mother guided her toward a writing career because of something i had written my mother told me that i was going to be as great as paul lawrence dunbar she recalls with a hearty laugh and she firmly believed that in our house we had a collection of all his works i read it religiously and my father used to recite poems from it paul lawrence dunbar was a sort of household hero my mother said that so much i began to believe that this must be my destiny and i accepted it she set right to work at it filling notebook after notebook with poems about all the things in her childs world especially the clouds she saw in the sky as she sat on her back porch actually the brooks backyard beyond its neat patch of lawn faces the grimy tottering backstairs of a row of tenements but gwendolyn seemed to see beyond them i was at my happiest sitting out on the back porch to sit there and look out at the western sky with all those beautiful changing clouds and just to dream about the future which was going to be ecstatically exquisite like those clouds she says adding with an earthiness that often bursts forth when the poet in her becomes too apparent of ctjurse i dont knbw what i expected of the future that was going to be that beautiful in those days she thought of writing as something almost holy explaining it got to be something like breathing or eating and those were the days of just happy writing the days before you had to worry about hows it going to sound is this going to ruin my reputation is this going to be worse than what ive done already but many of her memories of childhood are not happy ones i was very illadjusted she admits i used to love to go out and play with the children on the street but i couldnt skate i was never a good ropejumper and i remember thinking i must be a very inferior kind of child since i couldnt play jacks and that was the great game among little girls in my day it was even worse at school i was never a popular girl at school as my daughter nora is she says with a mixture of maternal pride and personal regret i stayed mostly to myself and the children thought that i was bashful but i was just awkward with other children her unhappiness was not too acute at forestville elementary school which she attended for the first six years but it did become so when she was transferred to willard school where some of the girls belonged to the social world as a terribly sensitive but plain black girl she was all too aware of the attitudes and values of others they had a little ingroup of social stars and a shabbily dressed outsider like myself couldnt have dreamed of being accepted in it i wasnt pretty i didnt have long hair or all those other nice little things here my fatlier was a janitor and these other fathers were post office clerks and city hall workersthey were among the elite thenand doctors and lawyers and that was really something her separateness was not entirely a matter of social distinctions for she adds even among the girls who were not in tlie ingroup even among the girls who were the equivalent of the blackstone rangers a noted chicago gang today i was not accepted or i should say i wasnt even noticed i was just something that was there and not there a person of profound simplicity miss brooks remains unaffected by public accolades when informed this year that she was to he named poet laureate of illinois as successor to the late carl sandburg she responded with a lusty laugh a new hook of her poems entitled in the mecca will be published this august yet today i find people wholl come up to me and say gwen remember the good times we used to have in school and i remember those days too well in contrast to her literary precocity in which none of her teachers took a particular interest her scholastic performance was very poor in her words at my best i was average i spent more time brooding over my relations or lack of relations with other children than did thinking about my lessons that was what worried me still i did nothing to merit their acceptance she did not participate in extracurricular activities joined no clubs or teams hated gym and recalls girls who were good in athletics seemed like some kind of forbidding goddesses to me adjustment to her peers was so difficult that she was led to change high schools three times before finally graduating from chicagos englewood high school in the days when it was not yet totally black throughout those years of adolescence which were markedly more awkward for her than for most others her prime pleasure continued to be poetry her first published poem had appeared in american childhood magazine when she was the same year she had published her own shortlived champlain weekly news a handwritten newspaper featuring all the gossip she had heard about the neighbors somewhat later she had begun contributing poems to lights and shadows a popular miscellany column in the chicago defender her contributions eventually were to total and she still keeps them pasted in a little homemade book when she was her mother prompted a reluctant gwendolyn to send a sampling of her poems to the great james weldon johnson she was surprised to receive a polite reply in which he advised her to read modern poetry she promptly sent off another batch of poems to him which is why she says today really i must never be hard on those people who send things to me now because i came not once but twice later that same year when james weldon johnson came to town mrs brooks wasted no time in hustling her daughter over to the church where he was appearing gwendolyn remembers him as a man in his noble forties very tall very erect very firm young gwen did have a chance to meet the great man and he even shook her hand this was not quite enough for her mother who prodded johnson with the words but shes the one who sent you the poems he replied in coolness and restraint i get so many of them both mother and daughter were somewhat disappointed that they had made so little an impression but they rallied in time for the subsequent arrival of langston hughes at the church where he was to speak mrs brooks maneuvered gwendolyn past a suspicious usher with the words my daughter writes hughes whom miss brooks has always regarded as one of the nicest men i ever met was particularly obliging that day he read several of her poems on the spot neither one knew at the time that they would later become friends but he expressed approval and said he thought shed be a writer someday he was the first wellknown person to encourage her openly though she now admits it made me feel so happy but i would have gone on anyway because there was no stopping me no matter how rottenly i was writing go on she did though most of these efforts were little known or of little interest to her schoolmates in one high school class she did impress a teacher with a book review written in rhyme to cover up her lack of knowledge about the book two of her poems did appear in the englewood school paper which was enough to prompt a few classmates to write inscriptions in her yearbook wishing her luck as a poet after graduation the poettobe followed up her unpromising high school career with an equally undistinguished two years at wilson junior college winch was in its infancy with a tuition of only six dollars a semester she took a general language course selecting latin whicli was said to be useful in improving ones mastery of english but she had no idea whatsoever as to what she eventuallv intended to do for a living i knew i had to get a job she recalls but i knew one thing i did not intend to do and that was to teach i dont know why i was set so strongly against it her completion of the twoyear course at wilson in marked the end of her formal education for a while i tried to tell myself that i would do what so many other young people are doing today which is to work and go back to school but i knew i had no actual intention of doing that with such a vague and impractical educational background she found it difficult to get any sort of job particularly in those postdepression years the chicago defender columnist who had accepted her many poems for lights and shadows suggested she apply for a reporting job with the paper and agreed to arrange for an interview with robert s abbott the publisher this proposal excited her tremendously she did get the interview but she did not get the job of this she says if i had been hired by the defender i might hae stayed in the reporting field though im not certain how i would have reacted to the actual duties of dashing off to cover a fire or a murder the job she did find was as a maid in a north shore home a monthlong ordeal that later was to inspire a biting chapter in her first last and only novel mattel martha more than years later she walked off from another domestic job on the first day and after haunting the illinois state empknanent service offices finally acquired this nice typing job working as a secretary to a spiritual advisor his offices were in the mecca building a great sprawling south side slum building that once had been chicagos showiest apartment house he sold holy thunderbolts lucky charms and numbers she says of him and ill never forget the four horrible months i spent in the grasp of that man the dreariest time of my life along with four other secretaries had to bottle all this medicine which was probably nothing more than colored water write letters and type up sheets of lucky numbers we would type them up on long sheets and then clip themjust any numberand send them to people miss brooks was delivered from the clutches of this spiritual advisor when he informed her one day that she was to become assistant pastor of the storefront church he operated in the building next door it was mandatory that she appear for services the coming sunday for she might also have to do a little preaching on the side she refused to appear and when she showed up at work the following monday she was promptly dismissed one good thing did happen to offset the unpleasantness of her postcollegiate period she joined the nacp youth council tlie hub of so many exciting and progressive activities in the chicago of the late s it was the stronghold of young intellectuals who would have jdrcferred being called negro to black in those days she became its publicity director and it was the opening up of a whole brave new world for her she says of it those were some of my happiest days because i had never thought rd have a whole hunch of friends of people who seemed to like me and thought that there was something to me it was then that my beautiful social life began one of the close friends she made at that time was margaret goss burroughs cofounder of chicagos museum of africanamerican history and art she and sculptor bernard goss her husband at the time sort of adopted the shy gwendolyn it was also through the youth council that she met another aspiring young writer henry blakely who was to become her husband in and the father of her two children a son henry jr now a yearold employment counselor living in chicago and a yearold daughter nora somewhat less than a whiz in the working world gwendolyn next settled down to being a housewife which was her main occupation until she began teaching in colleges five years ago since she and her husband were far from aflluent life was a matter of moving from one dreary little cubicle to another but the poems continued to flow and from her experiences of that period she was to draw the material for her works so wellknown for their sensitive reflection of the nuances of black urban life at the age of she took an important step by enrolling in a poetiy class at the south side community art center an institution that came into play in the shaping of so many black artists it was in that class under the leadership of inez stark boulton an editor at poetry magazine that she learned a great deal about modern poetry a sliglit hint of incipient success shone through in she won first prize in a contest conducted by that class and encouraged by this decided to submit a poem in a contest being conducted by the midwestern writers conference a group located on chicagos north side there was just a tiny notice about it in the newspaper she says and i know they didnt expect anyone like me to see it but they couldnt get away from me op eagleeyed gwen she was judged winner of the contest and a nice little old white lady came all the way down to the south side to deliver the prize to her she must have suspected the horrible truth by the time she got into the neighborhood says miss brooks but she came up the gritty stairs at e rd street and by the time she got to the top there could be no doubt about it for here was this black woman but thev still had to give me the prize later she won other prizes from that group through this writers conference she met emily morison an editor at the publishing house of alfred knopf who suggested that her firm might be interested in publishing some of the brooks poems should she ever have enough to make up a book later reply was that she had liked all the poems about negroes and that if she ever were able to complete a booklength collection of such poems shed be interested in seeing it tliat concluded miss brooks dealing with miss morison but from that point on she began to concentrate on negro poems realizing that they were the more vital of her works declining the opportunity to return to knopf fearing one refusal might be a jinx on the future she made out a list of leading publishers intending to run through its entire length if she had to and sent oflf her negro poems to harper and brothers now harper and row she included a brief letter explaining that if they liked the poems she was submitting shed be happy to send more which id have had to write right away she says on the side the answer from harper was more than what she might have hoped for they were indeed most impressed with her work and would be happy to publish a book when she had completed enough additional poems to round out a small volume whether it might take her one or two years to do so most encouraging though was a letter harper forwardetl to her i from richard wright who had been shown the work it was one of extraordinary praise he referred to her as a real poet evident in the way she easily catches the pathos of petty destinies the whimper of the wounded the tiny incidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor and the problem of common prejudice wright also pointed out the main strength of her work with the comment there is not so much an exhibiting of negro life to whites in these poems as there is an honest human reaction to the pain that lurks so colorfully in the black belt however he did object to her suggested title for the volume a street in bronzeviue as one that might have no meaning to those unfamiliar with chicago and suggested that she include one long poem to tie the work together miss brooks did not take one or two years to complete the additional work she finished it in two weeks and retained the original title it was published on aug which was also vj day she was hailed immediately as a remarkable young poet with william rose benet saying of the bronzeviue work her ballad of pearl mae lee is invariably tragic her book throughout a dramatic figure an unusually expressive phrase miss brooks is an original as dynamic as langston hughes she is saliently individual from this glorious beginning so long in the making she went on to lroduce the books that have consolidated her position as a leading a new york times book reviewer said in technique and impression it stands virtually alone of its kind bronzeville boys and girls a perennially popular collection of poems for children the bean eaters in another collection of poetic jewels culled from the black experience selected poems in which pairs most of the old favorites with newer work this summer she will take another major step forward for a new book of poems in the mecca will be published on aug it is one that her public has long awaited and one on which she has been working intennittently for several years the inspiration for it dates back to the period when she worked for the spiritual advisor in the mecca building and she describes it as one long poem a mosaic of the little lives that were contained in that building the cramp and all however this comprises but onehalf of the book and it is in the second portion entitled after mecca that she stresses the new more militant direction her work is taking it is tliis section of the work that includes her poem malcolm_x and the already popular the wall a tribute to that painted exaltation of blackness standing tall as a symbol of respect in the heart of chicagos south side ghetto her attitude toward public reception of these poems also has taken a new direction though she acknowledges that white critics have played a major part in the making of her reputation she passionately asserts im absolutely free of any fear of what any white critic might say because i feel that its going to be most amazing if any of them really understand the true significances of the struggle thats going on she has not always felt this way and admits i think almost any writer who isnt thinking along the lines that im thinking now would be much concerned over what the critics say but what they want from me and what i want for myself now are just two different things they will probably look at the blacker products and disapprove of them because naturally they will have to disapprove of a disapproval of themselves this new feeling of creative freedom she attributes to her experiences with the young black writers from whom she says she has learned a great deal they too are a source of inspiration lor her and she says of them theyre raw they dont try to pretty up anything and i have the greatest admiration for them theyre stimulating to me and they are so enthusiastic about the strength of their voices we need them theirs is a direction in poetry that needed to be taken she points out that many of them have no interest in writing for whites and sees great promise in the new blackowned publishing enterprises that arc specializing in the production of small softbonnd looks that will appeal to those not formerly accustomed to reading however she is essentially and irrevocably a craftsman and says of their work just now theres such a gush of raw vigor that im careful about it when it comes into my hands i dont want to do anything that would impede that vigor theres something very special happening in poetry today and i see it happening chiefly among the young blacks i think that later thev will take out some of the unnily roughness but right now im just glad to see it coming out i think the next phase of the activity will be an intense interest in saying things more effectiely using language more effectively this is the poet in her speaking from out of a mind so tough and so terribly disciplined that one of her young writers has remarked gwens wonderful and motherly but when it gets down to working on paper shes fonnidabler yet there is another side of her for she has always insisted that she is just an ordinary person who is impelled to write poetry this is the gwendolyn brooks who is mrs henry blakely a wife and mother who worries about her daughters passing interest in a wig and quibbles with her husband an insurance adjuster over the little matters that are the fabric of married life she lives simply in her little brown house seemingly disinterested in acquiring material possessions fame has not tarnished her basic simplicity and utter lack of pretension hers are tlie ordinary pleasures of watching the serials on television having shrimp for breakfast and then racing madly to and from the writing classes she teaches at three chicago area collegeselmhurst northeastern state and columbia college she goes by bus l train and an occasional taxi for she does not drive though she has had opportunities to visit europe and africa she has never been out of the country for she refuses to travel by plane as a friend says fly why gvvenll hardly get in an elevator without a parachute the interiors of lav ish restaurants and night clubs are almost foreign to her and she does not drink or smoke she is such an unobtrusive person one who would go unnoticed in a gathering of those selected for importance and then one picks up a volume of her work in which the poor are spoken of as things of dr hours in places where late light slants in diluted gold bars across the boulevard brag of proud seamed faces with mercy and mmder hinting at such times it is diflbcult to believe that so much beauty could have come from out of one small and gentle woman thought i would write you a short letter it is probably more for my good than it is for yours i hope it will not be too long before you read it in heaven i know you have so much to do so many people to see and i know many of them have already been looking and waiting for you it wouldnt be a surprise to me martin if god didnt have a special affair just to introduce his special activist black son to so many others like you that have gone on ahead i know you wouldnt believe that could happen but then you did not always understand how wonderful you are but look up these black friends and talk to the ones you and i have talked about and the ones that you and i led and the ones who so gallantly followed your leadership say thanks to those prophets we quoted all over america and everywhere else that they asked for us give a special word from me to peter the man who was once sand but jesus made him a rock give my warmest felicitations to my favorite apostle john who loved my master so much until he stood with his mother at the foot of the cross pass my greetings on to isaiah who had the prophetic vision to see the coming of a saviour whose name would be wonderful a mighty counselor an everlasting father and a prince of peace stop by and chat with hosea and find mahatma k gandhi the man who inspired us so much in our stniggle to free black people through the philosophy and techniques of nonviolence and in the midst of your conversations martin mention me look up bartholomew for some strange reason i always liked him but above all i want you to see jesus go to the throne and tell how thankful we are yes go see jesus and tell him about us down here all of us and all of our families and how we have sustained ourselves in the many battles all through our lives tell him how much we love him tell him how his name is music in our ears tell him how at his name our knees will forever bow and our tongues will alwavs confess tell him that we follow not only his words but we follow his life for his footprints lead to bethany for thats where he staved but thev lead to gethsemane for it was there he prayed they lead to calvary where salvation was complete there we were saved by his grace then martin go from the throne and find tlie rev george lee that stalwart hero who could barely read and write who was shot down on the streets of belzoni miss simply because he wanted to vote check with medgar evers who was shot down by mean and cruel white men who thought they could turn us around by taking the life of this young man check with william moore another casualty in alabama and then jimmy lee jackson who died on the battlefield of alabama oh i wish you would look up mrs viola liuzzo a white woman who was killed you remember on highway and then check with jonathan daniels a young theological cathohe student who died in haynesville ala down in lowndes county standing up for the rights of black people james reeb should be seen also martin for james reeb a unitarian minister was beaten to death when he came to march for us in selma and dont forget michael schwemer and andrew goodman and james chaney you remember those three freedom fighters that they killed in mississippi and buried their bodies beneath an earthen dam express our thanks to them and then martin dont forget the four little innocent girls who died in a sunday school class in the th street baptist church in birmingham theyve been waiting to hear from us give them a good and complete report and tell them that you left your people on your way and were deter mined that we aint gonna let nobody him us around and then martin find frederick douglass that great and marxelous human personality who li ed in even more difficult times than we live todav check with nat turner and marcus garvev for thev too are heroes in our crusade and oh i wish that you would pause long enough at the mansion that is occupied by abraham lincoln the man who freed us from physical bondage here in this country then martin we owe a great debt of gratitude to john fitzgerald kemiedy who less than five years ago young as you were brilliant as you were filled with new ideas as you were washot down and killed as you were in cold blood by a mean vicious and angry society and dont forget malcolm_x look for malcolm_x martin remember our god is a loving god and he understands things we dont think that he understands malcolm may not have believed what we believe and he may not have preached but he was a child of god and he was concerned about the welfare of his people and then martin please do not forget about all of those who died across alabama mississippi louisiana chicago and new york and all other places where men have died for the liberty and justice of other men martin it may seem like a big order but if you find one of them he will know where the rest are and he will take you to them i know that they have founded the grand international company of freedom fighters and cant wait to introduce you to take over the final hours a man on hunter street said i envy the way that he died he will be with so many who have died like he did i know that you have a lot to talk about and you will have a wonderful time but iinember your brother ralph will be coming along one day one thing we wont have any critics up there martin i dont think they will make it tliat they will be there every day will be sunday none but the righteous will see god tlie day after i last saw you in mempliis i remembered you from the first time i saw you it was in montgomery ala this was a very jovial memory in fact i first saw you in church you were still a student at crozier theological seminary you were preaching at the ebenezer baptist church even then you moved me you remember that you were preaching that sunday on the subject of tjw christian ami faith afterwards when eerybody was shaking hands with you i shook your hand also and i remembered your handshake it was warm and strong it was soft and tender i liked you even then strangely enough martin the second time i saw you was at spelmans sisters chapel you were welldressed and you were giving your attention to a very pretty lady you escorted her there in the prime of your life i need not remind you that it wasnt coretta for this was long before she came into your life you were young then you were a student and you were just playing the field how different now dciur friend you had come there to see others now others are coming to see you i know you can hardly believe it as you look down on us and see those long silent lines of people waiting in the cool evening the early mornings the springtime noon and even in the weary midniglit hours passing under the budding green trees past your silent bier well martin if you ever had any moments of doubt about whether people loved you now in the time of death you no longer have to doubt you kept the faith with them and you brought us through the dark and difficult days and nights of our movement now they keep it with you throughout the night around the clock today so much is happening in sisters chapel the second place where i saw you and even more will happen in the ebenezer baptist church and the morehouse quadrangle and all across the world in the days and the years to come it was after that third time martin that i met you when we really became fast friends you will remember this meeting it was in my home the parsonage of the first baptist church in montgomery we were never separated until the other day as you know i was right behind you there as i have always been i dont know why they got you and left me i cant help but talk about it i ran to you as quickly as i could and i said its me ralph you rolled your eyes around in your head and even with your jaw shot out and your vocal chords gone you still tried to talk to me those were some of the last thoughts you who had been our spokesman couldnt speak any more but dont worry martin for theyre playing continue for a few days but you may be assured tliat we wont ever let your words die like the words of our master jesus christ they will live in our minds and our hearts and in the souls of black men and white men browm men and yellow men as long as time shall last let me go back to our third meeting it was so different in that third meeting you had arrived to become the new pastor of the dexte avenue baptist church in montgomer i left the parsonage and came over to greet you you remember you had picked up that great preacher vernon johns by accident and brought him back to preach at the first baptist church he had preceded you at dexter and everyone was happy to see you two together tlie great old preacher vernon johns with his quick wit and pervading wisdom served as a softening force to our personal thoughts and feelings we became real friends and true companions that afternoon thank god we have remained so through the years that was the beginning our families spent many nights and days together we were at one house and then the other house discussing the great issues and ideals simply because there were no restaurants or motels or hotels that we could go in on a nondiscriminatory basis those were fighting times for thought and for planning we got to know each other very well and we got to know the souls of each other in tliose moments as i write i realize that god made us good friends so that he could later make us a working team as a man in the movement says god knows what he is doing that stays on my mind these days but i wish so very much that it wcre the other way looking back things seem clearer now than ever before dates come to me how people looked is clearer and the meaning of some events that have come to me with greater emphasis it was early in the morning on december nd when i received a telephone call from e d nixon a pullman porter who told me how mrs rosa parks had been jailed fingerprinted and mugged like a common criminal he said to me that something ought to be done because this woman only wanted to sit down on the bus and she refused to give her seat to a white man but before doing anything i checked with you martin upon your suggestion i went into action began organizing the ministers calling meetings and from that day until now our lives have been in action together i remember how we talked together about who should be the leader of the new movement you had not been in montgomery very long you were just out of the seminary and some people wanted me because they knew me and i was president of many organizations in montgomery and i could have forced mvself to be the leader but i never as you know martin wanted to be the leader i only wanted to stand with you as caleb stood with moses from the grand action of the montgomery movement our lives were filled with the action of doing gods wall in village hamlet and city we used to talk theology and then we learned to do theology it was great it has been great martin remember gees bend dowm in wilcox county ala remember that day we stopped at a little filling station and bought jars of pickled pigs feet and some skins in mississippi because they would not serve us at a restaurant remember martin they wouldnt let us eat downtown but our staff in that little crowded black mans country store had a fellowship a kononia together we had a puqose and we had a universal sense of love that they did not have downtown some of my eperiences wdth you will never be forgotten you will recall how we went to greensboro n c when the sitins broke out and how we sat in in order that black men might stand up all over the world you remember the freedom rides and how we were incarcerated and how we were forced to spend the night in the first baptist church in montgomery with thousands of our followers while angry mobs stood on the outside you remem ber the albany movement and how police chief laurie pritchett and his forces tried to turn us around and a divided negro com munity became disgusted and despondent you said to me ralph we must go on anyhow you remember bull connor brought out liis vicious dogs his fire engines and his water hoses and tried to stop us in birmingham but it was you martin who said to me ralph dont worry about the water because weve started a fire in birmingham that water cant put out you will recall savannah ga and how we went there to the aid and rescue of hosea williams hosea is still with me and he has promised to be to me martin what i tried to i be to you you remember the march on wash ington when more than americans and people from all over the world came to hear you talk about i have a dream you remember danville va and how they put us in jail you remember st augustine fla and hoss manuci when he said that he did not have any evil vices whatever he did not drink liquor he did not chase after women he did not smoke his only hobby was beating and kilhng niggers but we knew how to deal with hoss and we changed him from a lloss into a mule you remember how we worked on bull connor and changed him from a bull into a steer you remember how we marched acros edmund pettis bridge in selma and the state troopers lined across upon the orders of gov george wallace and said that we could not pass but we kept on marching and when we got there it opened up like the red sea opened up for moses and his army you remember how mayor richard daley tried to stop us in chicago but we would not let him turn us around my dear friend martin now that you have gone there are some special thoughts that come to me during this lenten season there are so many parallels you were our leader and we were your disciples those who killed you did not know that you loved them and that you worked for them as well for so often you said to us love your enemies bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you they did not know martin that you were a good man that you hated nobody but you loved everybody they did not know that you loved them with a love that would not let you go they thought that they could kill our movement by killing you martin but martin i want you to know that black people loved you some people say that they were just burning and looting in the cities of the nation at this time but you and i know that just folk poor people have had a hard time during these difficult days in which we have lived on this earth and in spite of the burning i think they are saying he died for us it may seem that they are denying our nonviolence for they are acting out their frustrations and even a man of good as you were was killed in such an evil world as we live in today and they are merely seeking to express their frustrations tliey do not see a way out but i want you to know martin that were going to point to them a way that was the frustration of jerusalem during this same season nearly years ago but we know martin because we love people that after the venting of frustration there will be the need for reconciliation there you will be invisible but real black and white will need you to take them from their shame and reconcile them unto you and unto our master jesus christ your words of love are there and we will be there to follow your leadership there habeen a cnicifixion in our nation but here in this spring season as we see the blossoms and smell the fresh air we know that the resurrection will shortly appear vlien the master left the disciples they felt gloom at first then they gathered themselves together in a fellowship they must many grew up overnight they were covered with their ancient words and with despair we promise you martin just as the disciples tarried in that upper room that were going to wait until the power comes from on high were going to wait until the holy ghost speaks and when the holy ghost comes and when the holy ghost speaks were going to speak as peter spoke and others will be converted and added to the movement and gods kingdom will come we promise you martin that we will tighten our fellowship and cover our word dont worry my friend we will pull our load we will do our best with the help of our friends and above all with the help of god the poor peoples march will t ossing back her long black hair the girl began to sing sometimes i feel like a motherless child a long way from home her features were oriental the tonality of her voice

she admits i think maybe is him adds gentle understanding john we talked about this until tliree oclock one morning and decided to ask washington to help us locate her father she will be satisfied just to see his face e very baseball fan knows curt floods title greatest centerfielder in the game but not many know his nickname dubbed by st louis cardinal teammates its rembrandt and it fits because curt flood is an artist with brush and oils as well as the fielders mitt not long ago the pro baseball player turned professional portrait painter too now he bats out portraits priced from to each at the rate of three or four a season baseball and painting make a good balance claims the virile vigorous young man whose spectacular runs and graceful leaps explode from musclepower held in taut check and balance baseball is virile he says its rough and tough painting is sensitive quiet its an outlet to overcome tension curt paints portraits the way he plays ball fast smooth with perfection he works on three or four paintings at a time to speed things up an oil color smears if a second one is added before the first one dries so he goes as far as he can on one portrait then turns to another oil paint takes a long time to dry and curt flood is impatient his colors flow on slick and smooth rounding over features touched with highlights blending into deeptoned shadows the portraits have a plastic look a threedimensional qualityyou think that if you touch them theyll feel like sculpture he uses a pantograph for perfection tracing a stylus around a photograph that curt insists must be at least an inch in size a pencil at the other end of the pantograph copies the drawing onto paper when hes got it exactly right he transfers the penciled drawing onto canvasusually a x inch sizeand paints at it off and on for a couple of weeks the results are so lifelike its amazing its perfect it looks exactly like her mareled a grateful father given a curt flood portrait of his yearold who had died of by nell gross leukemia curt did the painting at the request of the childs mother later gave his commisoa to the leukemia guild of missouri all he needs is five or minutes with the subject to get an idea of color and temperament ive got a good eye curt says frankly youve got to have good vision to see a ball come off a bat feet away he claims he works tight with the careful accuracy of mechanical drawing it comes from past experience with an engraving firm in his home town of oakland calif when he did mechanical drawings for a tool and die firm and used a powerdriven pantograph to engrave tiny letters on metal dies even as a kid curt could draw a good likeness and was always scribbling around drawing but it wasnt until the fall of that he went in for art seriously he enrolled in the college of arts and crafts in oakland on a special limited basisbecause he could only attend three months in winter after the ball seasons end he went for two years learning art techniquesall those things you have to learn if you want to paint and he got the hang of it theres more to art than just putting paint to canvas he says like perspective and a knowledge of light and shadow about a year ago curt did a portrait of cardinals president august a busch jr he got a notion he wanted to do it because gussies got such a classic facewrinkles good features intelligent eyes he caught the wrinkles the features and the eyes all right but he slipped up on a little thing working from a black and white photo he painted the braid on the yachtsmans cap gold i didnt know that meant captain of the vessel curt says with a rueful smile the owner of the ship wears black braid but that didnt slow down sales from that time on orders seemed to snowball they came from ballplayers businessmen parents cardinal pitcher bob gibson wanted a family portrait of himself with his wife and children other families wanted separate portraitsyou can start in with a family and go right through it says curt theyll want a portrait of everyone in the family sometimes like last summer when the cards were pennantpointed and flood was busy fielding and leading the team with his batting average art has to take a bleachers seat portrait production slows down to a walk because i can only paint when i feel like it curt admits t have the nerve to be temperamental i can only paint when it liits meand that could be am for that reason he never paints in the studio a sales office he has opened in st louis his studio is a spare room in his new threebedroom apartment on the nineteenth floor of the citys executive house he calls its plush green and blue elegance his bachelors quartersthough curt now is a divorced father of five perched on a high stool his foot frame hunched over a drawing board curt brushes on colors lovingly with a craftsmans hand i hke to paint portraits he says with people i can stay close to a likeness i know where fm going and what im doing that last statement sums up curt flood from the time he was the littlest kid in oakland fielding and catching on a neighborhood team baseball was his game and drawing was his hobby and he figured to make it big in both now hes a fivetime winner of the gold glove award given for the years best fielding and hes recognized today as one of the national leagues best allround performers as a great artist he feels he has a way to go hed like to learn more art history maybe learn to use acrylic paints and he might branch out to try a few abstractionsthough the ones hes done so far look like mechanical drawings but his portrait work is definitely a financial success great artist rembrandt van rijn died broke s eventythreeearold paul pop a stewart is the oldest member of the biggest gang in brooklyns destitute bedfordstuyvesant district he is a boy scout and with the responsibility that comes with age he is lending his eiierg and his yems of scouting experience to stnyford an experimental boy scout program for his own corner of new york s inner city stewart born and raised in bedfordstuyvesant became a boy scout when he was and has been a scout master since he was the only interruption in his scouting career came during world war i in which he participated as a member of tlie th pioneer infantr although the military introduced him to real segregation he returned to vigorously promote intenacial scouting in brooklyn lie still takes great pride in having created a member integrated drum and bugle corps paul stewart is a tinv fi efootthree pound man but tbe bustle of his later years bespeaks a dedication well out of proportion to his size he is his district s executi e representative to the brooklyn boy scouts an executive board member of the greater new york boy scouts council and new yorks representative to the national boy scouts council these positions reejuire him not only to shuffle papers but to pursue a heavy meeting schedule like every other post he has held in the scouts they pay him nothing for years he has drawn his livelihood from a dispatcherrecep p aul stewart has seen the social changes in his native bedfordstiiyvesant originally a heterogeneous comniunity of black italian jewish and irish families it is now per cent black and per cent puerto rican the district is now one of low incomes with pockets of abject poverty it is estimated that as many as of its residents are recent arrivals from the deep south and puerto rico some of the migration is due to economic and racial dissatisfaction says stewart but theres a lot of false recruiting going on cynical recniiters go down there and misrepresent job opportunities and salaries to these poor people who are not prepared for big city living and cant compete in the job market many adults in bedfordstuyvesant are immobilized by despair stewart believes while youth does not submit or succumb without putting up a fight he urges that some institution old or new must learn to relate to the young people because he feels the home police and schools do not know how to reach them he reserves his harshest appraisal for the schools we have a lot of nice young girls in miniskirts with new teaching licenses and no experience most of them are just waiting around to get married he complains many regard their function as mainly custodial keeping the kids in line and clerical checking attendance and giving passing marks because nobody gets left behind to help bridge the communication gap between the young and old in brooklyn the boy scouts with stewarts assistance have begun the stiiyford experiment the project is part of the scouts inner city program keyed to troubled boys in the crowded low income areas of cities and designed to lay away the white anglosaxon middleclass image of the boy scouts the program initially financed by grants from the astor james hayden charles s hayden and cleveland e dodge foundations has had marked success in los angeles within the past year scout membership in watts has increased to exceed that in any other district of los angeles scouting is also being adapted to los angeles mexicanamerican community and to the sons of appalachian migrants in cincinnati according to stewart the greatest obstacle to scout organization in bedfordstuyvesant is a shortage of male leadership the men he says do not participate because the struggle to take care of their families leaves them little time for anything else the boy scouts he says have not yet been able to convince them that the stuyford project is relevant to the needs of their sons despite the problems however per cent of bedfordstuyvesants eligible boys have become involved in the scout movement the figure compares favorably with the per cent in the new york city area and the per cent national enrollment stewarts lifelong involvement in scouting has affected his family married twice to women he fondly calls two good wives who were understanding and helpful to me in my scouting activities he has a daughter who was in the girl scouts a soninlaw who is active as a scout master and a yearold grandson who is a scout his home in bedfordstuyvesant where he has lived alone since the death of his second wife last year is filled with mementos awards honors and a file on each boy ever enrolled in any of his brooklyn troops the day dawned cold and cloudy there was a film of ice on the narrow cobblestone streets and a tang of tension in the boston air boston by now was used to tension as the center of the burgeoning resistance movement to british colonial rule the city was virtually controlled by fiery revolutionaries who roamed the streets smashing windows setting fires and pelting officials with snowballs and stones rioting and looting were common in the city and there was constant skirmishing between bold young men and the redcoated british troops the day dawning now promised to be no better and no worse than the preceding days of this riotous season nobody knew then that the day would end in the blood and steel of the boston massacre the good burghers of the city rose early ate well and went to the shops and offices on washington street longshoremen and laborers moved by ones and twos to the docks and factories indentured servantsblack and whiteroused themselves for another days work in the service of their puritan masters during the day a few inches of snow fell the sky cleared late in the afternoon and at sunset a new moon appeared in the cloudless skies over beacon hill on beacon hill and in roxbury and in the ghetto of new guinea menblack and whiteclung to the routines of a life time but beneath the surface moved explosive forces that would make this daymonday march a day to remember somewhere in boston on this day wily old sam adams and the sons of liberty were studying revolution and setting traps and snares somewhere in boston a black man named crispus attucks was moving toward a critical crossroad of history somewhere in the city private hugh montgomery of the british army was eyeing the building tension with apprehension tension had been building in boston now for eighteen months puritan revolutionaries were in open revolt against the government and there was rising antagonism between welltodo boston loyalists who sided with great britain and angry patriots who contended that taxation without representation was tyranny when in the winter of the colonial masses pushed their way onto the stage the struggle reached explosive proportions throughout this long cold winter the masses who were exploited by the british and the colonists rioted stoned the houses of loyalists and voiced open demands for a social as well as a political revolution in this winter as in the long hot summers of the black revolution riots became a political weapon behind the scenes talented puritan revolutionaries like samuel adams fanned the fires of discontent by organizing demonstrations boycotts and riots black people and other lowincome bostonians who had nothing to lose and everything to gain were in the front ranks of this struggle although there were only one thousand blacks in the boston population of to patriots of color were vociferously visible in the street demonstrations and riots black people for example were among the most creative and defiant of the stamp act rioters many years later author john miller described one of the riots for a fortnight he wrote the tension in boston continued to increase until on the night of august boys and negroes began to build bonfires in king street and blow the dreaded whistle that sent the boston mob swarming out of taverns houses and garrets a large crowd immediately gathered around the bonfires bawling for liberty and property these riots led to the germinal decision to send troops to boston and this decision led bullet by bullet to the declaration of independence the quartering of troops in boston gave samuel adams and other revolutionaries an opportunity to create a revolutionary situation the puritan revolutionaries made good use of this opportunity and within a short time the position of the troops was untenable there were provocations on both sides and a series of bloody incidents a few months before the boston massacre the redcoats and the blacks clashed on boston common a boston newspaper commented in the morning nine or ten soldiers of colonel carrs regiment were severely wiiipped on the common to behold britons scourged by negro drummers was a new and ver disagreeable spectacle unquestionably and yet the spectacle continued there were repeated incidents in february and on friday march there was a brawl between the soldiers and the ropemakers ripples from this incident spread across the city and by nightfall on monday march boston was boiling as soon as the new moon appeared over boston hill the soldiers and civilians began jockeying for position by eight oclock the streets were clogged with defiant men spoiling for a fight witnesses said later that a tall man almost a giant dominated one segment of this wandering crowd this man who answered to tile name crispus attucks has caused traditional historians no end of trouble in the first place he was not a proper bostonian in fact he was not even white by singular circumstances the hero of the boston massacre and the first martyr of the revolution was a black man and a former slave it was attucks who rallied the wandering crowd and focused its fury it was attucks who carried the battle to the eneinv it was attucks an obscure black man who was the first to defy and the first to die some writers have suggested that attucks and his colleagues were maneuvered into action by behindthescenes agitators who wanted to create a revolutionary point of departure to be sure there is some evidence to indicate that the sons of liberty set the stage for the disturbance but there is no convincing evidence to indicate that attucks acted for anyone other than himself the record indicates moreover that attucks had a deep and unquenchable love of liberty six feet two with a fierce countenance and a volatile disposition attucks had been bom in slavery some years before in framingham massachusetts in september he struck his first blow for freedom by running away from his master on october william browm of framingham entered the following description of the runaway in the boston gazette short curly hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colored bearskin coat plain brown fustian jacket or a brown wool one new buckskin breeches blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway convey him to above said master shall receiv e ten pounds old tenor reward and all necessary charges paid and all masters of vessels or others are hereby cautioned against concealing or carrying off said servant on penalty of the law attucks eluded his pursuers and apparently went to sea as a sailor there is some evidence to indicate that he spent a great deal of time around the docks in lower boston but his movements prior to the night of the boston massacre are a matter of conjecture it was said later that he was in boston on march awaiting a ship for north carolina however that might be the fact remains that attucksbold defiant and adventuresomewas at center stage on the night of the first momentous act of americas birth this drama entered a new phase after eight oclock on the night in question when the british soldiers sallied out of murrays barracks and went for a stroll this maneuver was designed apparently to prove that the soldiers were not afraid if so it was illtimed and illconsidered for the soldiers were soon embroiled in a freeforall with the inflamed citizenry someone ran to the old brick meeting house and rang the fire bell men poured out of the garrets and houses and boston vibrated with the sounds of incipient rebellionthe beating of drums the ringing of bells cries screams imprecations at about the same moment not too far away a sentry and a barbers apprentice exchanged insults the sentry clubbed the youth with the butt of his musket the youth ran screaming through the streets embellishing the story no doubt as lie went in the wake of this event wild minors circulated through the crowd some men said the sentry had stabbed the youth some men said they had it on good authority that the youth was already dead reports of the altercation reached crispus attucks in dock square according to one report he exploded saying the way to get rid of these soldiers is to attack the main guard strike at the nest the dock square crowd with attucks in the forefront flowed in the direction of king street shouting let us drive out these ribalds they have no business here part of the crowd went up royal exchange into king street but the largest group followed crispus attucks through boylstons alley attucks was armed with a large cordwood stick according to an eyewitness attucks and his men were huzzahing and whistling and cann ing their sticks upright over their heads before long there was a crowd of perhaps a hundred whooping hollering cursing bostonians in the little square near the custom house the barbers apprentice pointed to the sentr and said this is the bwho hit me the crowd shouted knock him down kill him the sentry backed up the steps of the custom house shoved tlic rammer down his musket and primed it by this time reinforcementsseven subalterns and captain thomas prestonwere pushing through the crowd crispus attucks who was standing in the rear of the crowd sized up the situation and seized command do not be afraid he said they dare not fire the crowd echoed attucks words damn them they dare not fire firel and be damned attucks and his party gave three cheers and pushed to the front of the crowd adancing to the tips of the soldiers bayonets it was about ninethirty now and the bayonets of the beleagured soldiers glistened in the light of the clear moon for several seconds attucks and the soldiers stood face to face then without warning someone threw a stick the stick hit private hugh montgomery who fell backwards raised his musket and fired attucks who was standing near the gutter pitched forward blood gush ing from wounds in his chest the crowd surged forward and other soldiers fired when the smoke cleared five men lay sprawled in the snowthree dead two mortally wounded like other seminal chapters in history the events of this night pushed men across the borders of themselves from that moment daniel webster said later we may date the severance of the british empire john adams americas second president said on that night the foundation of american independence was laid he added not the battle of lexington or bunker hill not the surrender of burgoyne or cornwallis were more important events in america history than the battle of king street on the th of march three days later on march there was a public funeral for attucks and three other martyrs all boston shops closed in their honor and all the bells of the city and neighboring towns pealed in remembrance contemporaries reported that a greater number of persons assembled on this occasion than ever before gathered on this continent for a similar purpose the public outcry following the funeral forced withdrawal of the british regiment to castle island seven of the soldiers were tried for murder and acquitted two were found guilty of manslaughter and received minimal sentences at the trial john adams the defense attorney was critical of the boston crowd which he called a motley rabble of saucy boys negroes and mulattoes irish jeazues and outlandish jack tars adams said that attucks appeared to have undertaken to be the hero of the night and to lead this army with banners to form them in the first place in dock square and march them up to king street although most of the soldiers were exonerated attucks and his comrades were speedily transformed into exemplar myths the date of their deaths was celebrated as the national holiday until the adoption of the declaration of independence one hundred and eighteen years after their deaths a monument was erected to the martyrs on boston common john boyle oreilly wrote a special poem for the occasion and honor to crispus attucks who was leader and voice tlikllk are more than fox hunters in england they gallop on horseback across dewy green fields following a pack of bellthroated hounds that in turn pursue the elusive cunning fox of the annual hunts in the british isles today one of the most grueling the tredegar fanners hunt depends on the skill of huntsman arthur emanuel joseph the first hunting official of african heritage in the british isles joseph was bom in wales in the same year his father a black man from antigua west indies immigrated to bassaleg wales and married a welsh girl doris sergent the younger joseph followed his fathers footsteps and began working at a cardiff steel rolling mill in he still works there today but ever since his energies and all his free time have been devoted to the tredegar farmers hunt joseph holds the honorary position of huntsman in this man hunt the huntsman must manage the pack of hounds during the chase after the fox he works so hard at his sport that during the hunting season he spends hours each week working at the mill and hours looking after the foxhounds and two horses and hunting the fox the remaining hours of the week he spends in bed t his summer about white students from carleton college in northfield minn are accepting the most important challenge facing white people who claim they want to bring freedom equality and justice to all americans the challenge illuminated by the riot commission report is obvious now if the effects of white racism are to be erased whites must undertake the task of erasing the causes of racism in the attitudes of the white community last fall the black students at carlcton presented this challenge to the schools white students on posters which read are you a white liberal well damn it prove it about white students responded first some formed the white action committee which organized mixed dormitory discussions in order to combat the widespread ignorance white students revealed concerning the history and current experiences of afroamericans the wac also recommended books to white students particularly the autobiography of malcolm_x but the impact of the murder of dr martin_luther_king pushed many white students into the realization that their oncainpus efforts were not enough to dent the wall of american racism tliey saw that the crucial problem in american society lies among the faceless often thoughtless mass of white people huddled together across the country in allwhite residential areas suburbs small towns and fanning communities to educate these white people to change them that is the challenge some white carleton students have accepted and they ha e devised a fourpronged attack calling not only for monetary sacrifices on their part but also psychological sacrifices since they must anticipate the same apathy scorn and open hostility faced by those black people who force an often silently racist society to express itself one group of at least nine students is working in the nearby minneapolisst paul area they began during the last term of the school year after dr_kings death and call their organization the twin cities social ction project the students received partial school credit during the last term in order to leave the campus and devote their full time to beginning programs in the white community supplementing this core group are volunteers who helped out during the school year and are now volunteering during their v acations the action project has divided students among three twin cities community organizations carleton sophomore marc saltzberg has dev ised a questionnaire for the council of religion and race aimed at surveying racial attitudes among the congregations of hennepin county the council will make test results available to ministers of these congregations and enlist their cooperation in starting a dialogue on white racism within the church another five action project members are working in the twin cities opportunities for industrialization center they are helping tcoic organize statewide campus support by whites for the poor peoples campaign in washington d c and three students are assisting john martinson a member of the state commission on pluman rights in setting up a program in a white suburb of st paul this program is examining various methods of starting a dialogue on the racial issue such as doortodoor canvassing vvtrking through churches and presenting dramas with racial themes such as martin dubermans in white america a play which the student xonviolent coordinating committee found effective in mississippi during the summer of the action project students who began in the spring have giv en up a third of their course credits for one term they must fulfill their requirements on their own but they feel that by the time the summer is over they will have gathered valuable information on the effectiveness of various methods of working against racism in white eominunities a sccond group comprised of about students is testing the success of the two classical aims of artto delight and to instruct by presenting plays with racial themes in chicagoarea white communities their goal as expressed by carleton junior david bartlett of green bay wis is to provide more information on he real problems of the afroamerican in a white racist society an imderstanclinji of afroamerican history and culture and a reshaping of attitudes based on this understanding this carleton drama troupt feels that drama which is not blatantly polemical will initially be more effective in opening the minds of whites they are adapting the lmse structure of satire song and dance of kith century commedia delf arte drama revising a theateroftheabsurcl play called the pit as well as the plays a study in color and in white america their initial bookings were arranged through a ymca oificial in a polishitalian area of chicago bartlett also hopes to use some of the conventions of psychodrania particularly those which pull members of the audience into the plays action and make them act out parts according to their own conscious and subconscious beliefs and with a blend too of electronic mixedmedia techniques the drama troupe believes it can penetrate the mental boundaries of bigotry and reach the source of bigotry in the recesses of white racists psyches the third student organization is called the hometown summer projectparttime group this projects spokesmen say they have organized on the assumption that it is white america which is responsible for the intolerable racial injustice which prevails in tliis country and hence that it is white america which must examine its values and assume the major part of the task of bringing alxjiit racial justice equality and understanding by devoting their spare time to the hometown project approximately white carleton students are trying to educate the white population of their community and encourage them to examine and readjust their values in order to bring about substantial change in the racial situation for instance by influencing commercial educational and political institutions they work through existing social organizations but where there are none project volunteers establish organizations of concerned local citizens whose work will continue beyond the summer the fourth group is the hometown summer projectfulltime group its aims and methods are the same as those of the parttime group but there are important difterences in the structure of the two groups the main fulltime group will be located in gleveland and its members are financed chiefly from two student sources individual students about donated some in pledges to be paid by october and the schools summer work scholarship fund gave them the fund is controlled by students themselves who this year decided that they would back only those projects attacking americas social injustices an anonymous donor from gleveland pitched in with and the college made up the rest of the necessary although only two of the are from the gleveland area the fulltime volunteers spent part of june in gleelands predominantly black hough area so that the whites ainong whom they work cannot accuse them of being ignorant outsiders bruce mckcndry son of a glevelandarca minister admits that the going is rough we sent to letters to ministers of white congregations offering our help to begin dialogues on racism but we only received a couple of responses those two were positive though mckendry says that white youths involved in working within white communties are aware that they are probably the first groups to bring the chickens of white racism home to roost in the white communities he describes students like himself as learchers for part of the day well be going around learning about the situation in these communities he explains and then during the remainder of the day well try to be teachers for pcxplc who have ignored the racial situation these olimteers are not starryeyed idealists mckendry notes with disappointment that there are almost no agencies working for racial understanding in the white community but the volunteers are certainly realistic idealists for they sav that the en dorsement and cooperation of per cent of the white community would mark a successful beginning in this new kind of social work mckendry based his caution on the fact that a moderate good neighbor policy statement which asked white citizens to pledge to welcome any person moving next door to me of any race color or creed who is a wellbehaved person and to work with him for a better community was signed by only of recipients despite the fact that signers could refuse to have their names published the final chapters of this fourpart program are being written right now no one can say how encouraging or frightening the reactions of the white communities will be but the fact that a group of students in a small midwestem college would plan and then carry out these vital and indispensable programs gives hope that those who erected the white curtain may some day tear it down furthennore these students provide an example for other whites who lamely ask afroamericans but what can i do one of the reasons that carlcton students black and white are boldly trying to create a new society is that the college administration has a man like associate professor of religion bardwell l smith as dean of the college dean smith is one of the few college administrators who is in total agreement with students who seek to end the cloisterlike atmosphere and babysitting aspects of the american college system he is an excellent model for schools that wonder what kind of leadership is necessary to bring harmony to a campus he hopes that afroamerican students will contribute new ideas to the white students who are trapped by a contrived competition for material goods and he hopes that the programs undertaken by ciirlctons students this summer will raise the tolerance for criticism of the white communities dean smith says he is alarmed at selfrighteous and blind backlash and adds that if whites cannot improve themselves it says an awful lot about what our chances are to build a good society dean smith pinpointed the problem which carletons white students must face this summer these white students are going to become increasingly aware of racism they will see how racism threatens everybodys freedom and so they must become aware of how to avoid arousing violent racism against themselves it is ironic that that is the tightropewalking lesson which black american parents from plantation days to the present have worriedly hoped their children would master w hen folksinger

hours later just a day over two months from the time martin_luther_king was assassinated in memphis tenn they killed another man n the song odetta sings the men who are gone are nameless even when she comes to the line they killed another man there is no identityanother mans done gonehes dead nameless dead and the killers are a nameless they the song is an old song an old work song of black men without names without hope and so resigned to their fates that they are almost without fear for years they were shot to death burned to death beaten to death lynched on lonely trees nobody really knew them few even cared about them they were buried in lonely graves and the mourners were few but in the swift modem world of today there has been a change far far too often the men who are gone are strong young men of promise they are men who literally are known to millions the men pictured on the opposite page were leaders who could command crowds at any public appearance and could not walk the streets of any major city without being recognized president john fitzgerald kennedy the reverend martin_luther_king senator robert francis kennedy mississippi naacp field director medgar evers black nationalist leader malcolm_xthese were men of substance controversial though they at times might have been when they joined the ranks of the literally hundreds who have been the victims of political civil and social assassination the entire world knew of it and the world was shocked how the question was asked both here and abroad could it happen a climate of violence he honest student of life in these united states would never ask such a question he knows the answer he knows that this country was founded in violence and that violence has been glorified in its histoiy its literature its dramas and its films the vicious gunmen both within and outside tlie law have become the folk heroes the jesse james the wyatt earps the billy the kids the killer bandits and the killer peace ofiicers are glorified in books songs and movies the vicious bounty and scalp hunters of the old west became the childhood heroes of generations of american children the lynch mobs the defenders of white womanhood of the south were ennobled in hundreds of romantic novels and the men who massacred thousands of defenseless indians in the rape of the west became heroes in elementary school textbooks today the bonnie and clydes the killers of n cold blood the al capones and the dillingers the hatchet murderers and other psychotic killers are dramatized on stage screen and television in vietnam after a battle troops move throughout the area in a body count to get a figure on viet cong killed to be reported on the late evening news more than people are killed in auto accidents each year and the figures on homicides keep rising we live daily in a climate of violence and it is little surprising that the violence now is reaching the top levels of society instead of being restricted to slum and ghetto areas who killed another man he question which every american both black and white must answer in the privacy of his own mind today is who killed another man it may be that the oswalds the sirhans the raysthe accused executionerspulled the triggers that sent good and decent men to their deaths but who is actually to blame what about the congressmen who for years have fought against the passage of an eflpective federal gun control law what about these men who piously prate about the right of american citizens to bear arms and talk about the joys of hunting while hundreds of young children are accidentally killed with these same weapons every year in homes across the nation shouldnt some of the blame be placed upon the manufacturers and distributors of these weapons which fall so easily into the hands of the criminal and the psychotic what about the lobbyists who judiciously manipulate the votes of these congressmen what about the superpatriots who protest mightily that the constitution guarantees the right of a citizen to own a gun but cannot even whisper a protest when a black man is denied his constitutional right to vote as a citizen simply because of his color many of the men who proclaim the right of a citizen to bear arms will turn around and do everything possible to deny that same right to a black citizen guns are designed and manufactured for one purpose onlyto kill as long as this nation remains an armed camp people will be killed by guns and even the strongest police or security force will not be able to determine who will be killed and when in a modem civilized society guns are unnecessary and the sooner they are completely outlawed the sooner man will learn to live in peace with his fellowman neededa change of climate odern man today especially in the united states lives in a climate of violence death and destniction policemen who are supposed to be the protectors of the citizenry too often become triggerhappy enforcers members of organized crime syndicates make laws of their own and intimidate legitimate businessmen into doing their will arsonists set fire to occupied buildings burning women and children to death black men who for years have listened to cries of kill the black bds now shout back kill whitey and little men with no pasts and no futures hog the limelight of the present by taking guns in hand and assassinating public giants john fitzgerald kennedy is dead martin_luther_king is dead robert francis kennedy is dead medgar evers is dead malcolm_x is dead viola liuzzo is dead denise mcnair is dead wharlest

little children negroes and whites men and women the good and the badanyone can be the victim of violence tlie only hope is an immediate and broad change in the climate of violence in this country its a faint and unhkely hope t here was the usual splendor of a debutante cotillion with the young women moving forward gracefully in their floorlength white dresses and the young men standing attentively in formal attire however there was one major difference these girls and seven boys were being presented to christian society as the crowning event of the educational divisions participation in the th quadrennial conference of the african methodist episcopal ame church the traditional music that might have accompanied such an affair had been replaced by solemn prayers and hymns of dedication to christian service there was no hint of frivolity in the affair it was a significant occasion for these young people who were reaffirming their faith before an audience of people in the great arena of the spectrum in philadelphia as mrs thurman boyd of historic mother bethel church pointed out in her introduction of the debs and masters too often our young people are maligned berated and misunderstood too infrequently is tribute paid to the wholesome hardworking teenagers who typify the younger citizens of the church typical of the ame youngsters are deb marsha vann and master andrew

occasion filled with excitement and new experiencesa fitting reward for their years of study and the outstanding service they had given to both their churches and communities t he ame debutantemaster dedication ceremony is the brainchild of mrs john n crawford sr of chicago she conceived it in the winter of when she was a sunday school district superintendent her dream was to present an annual interchurch program which would give recognition to young people who worked faithfully in their local churches mrs crawfords dream came true in may of when more than k young people participated in the first debutantemaster dedication at the coliseum ii chicago during the th quadrennial conference other presentations followed and in the dedication was elevated to a separate connectional committee in the division of christian education of ame churches mrs crawford was appointed general chairman as bishop william r wilkes greeted and blessed the debutantes and masters this year he paid tribute to the importance of the dedication ceremony youth is the business of ame churches and their hope he said for the church to fulfill its mission there t o most aspiring young stars hollywood the kingdom of movie and tv glory seems to be completely filled by the already established wealthy actors even for the most resolute and talented young hopefuls a place among the stars usually comes only after years of anonymity and frustration and then there are those like yearold gerald edwardsthose who get the lucky breaks gerald is starring along with chuck rifleman connors tom nardini and ronald howard in the abctv series cowboy in africa like others who seem blessed with good luck gerald did a lot towards making his own breaks his father and mother mr and mrs alvin edwards give him all the credit for his success mrs edwards remembers it began one evening when gerald saw an ad in the paper for children interested in an acting career he cut the ad out filled it in and worried us for days about mailing it back to the studio naturally we were rather hesitant about it but gerald was so persistent that we finally gave in and mailed in pictures and everything just to satisfy his wish no one even slightly suspected that anything would ever come of that ad so we proceeded to forget about it edwards completed the tale of his son s rise to fame we had completely forgotten the whole thing until one of our neighbors suggested that we take gerald to see a hollywood agent we did but then this practically slipped from our minds too until one day we received a call for gerald to come out to the studio and read for the part of samson a young orphan of the kikuyu tribe of kenya in the new cowboy in africa series but we were still rather skeptical edwards continued because there were some or boys reading for the part and not only that mrs edwards added the studio had flown another boy all the way from england to play the part so you can see the odds were stacked pretty high against gerald but gerald crushed the high odds and won the role of samson in the series n f course everyone asks gerald how he gets along with chuck connors who plays jim sinclair the world champion cowboy whom samson adopts as his father gerald replies hes great and we get along very well he teaches me all kinds of things and i dont think anyone can ride a horse any better than chuck can it is obvious to anyone on the set that gerald and chuck get along well even after working hours they spend a great deal of time together one of the things they have in common besides careers and their current jobs is sports connors is an exprofessional baseball and basketball player and sports are geralds number one hobby baseball is geralds favorite he has several trophies attesting to his abilities in almost every episode gerald is called upon to show his athletic talent in the high adventure the show provides for its fans since becoming an actor gerald no longer attends regular school as other kids do he is taught by a private instructor on the set his parents feel this has been a great advantage for him with the personal attention his knowledge has increased tremendously and so have his gradeshe is now an a and b student gerald is no pampered stage brat he is the oldest of five edwards children he has two sisters and two brothers and he knows that if he misbehaves they will too and he sets an example of hard work for after a day of acting and studying at the studio he comes home and has to do his chores then he goes out and plays with the other kids in his modest west los angeles neighborhood when gerald first appeared on television the edwardses were swamped with telegrams phone calls and letters from everone who had ever had even the slightest association with the family the phone rang every other minute mrs edwards recalls and we were up most of the night receiving telegrams of congratulations both of geralds parents work at a los angeles bakery his father as a sales supervisor and his mother as a packer they found it a bit uncomfortable when the main topic of every conversation with their coworkers was geralds acting career its not the main topic anymore much to their relief but they say their conversations still seem to close with some mention of their famous actor son despite gerald edwards dreamcometrue he is still the friendly and active hoy he was before he had a career and the edwards family is still as wellliked and neighborly as they were before since geralds success some friends have noticed a small but natural change the edwards have developed an even stronger feeling of family dedication and determination they are all making sure that young gerald will maintain the stability necessary for a long acting career w hen she was duke ellington used to say well theres the rose full bloom and everything now shes and he says theres the bud she of course is that perennial beauty lena horne who in the midstream of her life looks like a woman a decade younger admirers marvel at her strikingly beautiful face with its high cheek bones and hardly noticeable freckles women especially wonder how she has managed to stay a size and not add to the pounds that go so well with her fivefootfive height some find it almost impossible to believe that she has been in show business for years that she has been married to her second husband for years and that she has a yearold daughter and a yearold son both of whom have presented her with grandchildren recently the incomparable lena dressed in beige pants a dark brown feminized nehru jacket and appropriate beads swung out on the mike douglas show and the reaction was typical i didnt realize she was that little one lady in the audience told her friend while another observed i didnt know she was a grandmother a woman who couldnt stop staring at her asked how old is she and the lady next to her answered i dont know its hard to tell but ive neer seen her when she wasnt together mike douglas asked the invariable question lena how do you stay so beautiful and young she looked at him and laughed good strong stock and voodoo one week later she was in an abc studio with singer harry belafonte psychiatrist dr alvin poussaint and poetplaywright larr neal but this time her mind wasnt on singing she had joined the other black people on the show and newsman frank rey nolds for a frank discussion on bias and the media the panelists offered a compelling indictment of the racist media that has failed both black and white america but lena felt they were all talking to a blank wall when the taping ended she turned to dr poussaint and asked why do i have this terrible sense of futility he answered because you know it still is not going to be the way it should be nothing has changed she told poussaint he was wrong i would say that certainly the young black people are creating the change we older oneseen omselvcs are changing but weve all said whats wrong with america weve said everything there is to say they know whats wrong but they dont want to do anything about it several days later lena yvas standing in front of new yorks plaza hotel posing for pictures she yyas relaxed and casual in a chic version of the nehru looka broyvn striped pants suit that complimented her smooth brown complexion and black hair her mood was romantic as if she was having an affair with life and enjoying every minute of it the photographer said smile and her face lighted up her eyes pretty big and black she looked and felt good so much has happened to me in the last five years she explained i reall was instinctively or automatically just reaching before then but now im alive im aware i feel so much but it frightens me a bit i wont think past next month i really cant i just cant take that much there she was in three separate settings and each time a different person with ease and confidence lena horne can move from performer to panelist to complete woman proving that she is not only beautiful but also a complex person not easily categorized and frequently misunderstood shes been in the public eye since she started dancing at new yorks cotton club in when she was a pretty and timid but it was a long time before she found herself as a singer and as a black woman now after half a century with her beauty still intact her stature as a singer unshaken she has turned her fancy to acting making her dramatic debut in universals soontobereleased patch named after the man she marries on screen the fact that a black woman not only loves a white man richard widmark in the film but also marries him in no uncertain terms had pressmen flocking to the set in hollywood for interviews lena would rather they had not come theyre doing it all for the wrong reasons she says id like to think they came because they were interested in my acting but i know they didnt no matter she still has the chance to prove that she can act and the challenge excites her it is as if at she is starting a whole new life but at the same time she remembers the past what follows is a picture of todays lena drawn in interviews from her past present and future the interview took place a few days after she had returned from her home in palm springs she also maintains an apartment in new york where she had been with her hollywood musical director husband lennie hayton who is in california working on the musical score for the film version of hello dolly she was stunning in a beige pants suit with doublebreasted buttons down front and a brown floral scarf by her favorite designer sarmi tied carelessly around her neck she settled comfortably into a chair and began talking candidly after so many years away from hollywood why did you decide to do the film patch i dont know i tell you its that sign of mine cancer i havent acted ever really and five years ago i probably would have said no i wont do it but my sign is so unpredictable im very superstitious i follow my sign well i dont really call up every morning and see whats going to happen the only way i ever know that i am not going to do something or im against it is i really have an almost physical feeling of negation when i say yes and feel nothing is when i know im going to do it and thats what happened with patch the only movies i ever had a part in were cabin in the sky and stormy weather in all the rest around i just sang a number in this movie im claire a lady saloonkeeper in love with the sheriff of a small western town around hes been sheriff around years but the corrupt ieopie want to kill him i marry him knowing that outside the church they are waiting to gun him down i find acting difibcult because im having to overcome the fact that ive kept my emotions always in control its hard to let myself go especially in a situation that is foreign in any kind of acting you are someone else claire is not the same woman i am and she is under a different stress than i am as a black woman and i have to communicate with white people i know what my hangup is and im pounding away at it but its taking away bits and pieces of my wall john lehne my acting coach has helped a great deal hes not unaware of me as a black woman which is very important he is turning the disadvantagemy shell to an advantage by finding use for it in the role and there are sections in there which do call for a woman who is strong and who has had to have something to sustain a long relationship yearswith a rather taciturn man i understand her more than before because i have found myself in many of her attitudes its not an easy part i dont have to do a lot of crying but the emotion that i feel has to come out freely for it to ctime out i just think about a great many things from my jast i didnt think that something that id put out of my mind because it did pain me that id be able to cope with it and not cry but i do cope with it and it helps a great deal thats something john taught me i really am an emotional woman but ive had to be so strong all my life this untapped energy the reservoir of emotion that we all have you know some people use it easily but i just never had twentyfive years ago when i first wanted to act i couldnt because i didnt fit any of the stereotypes that hollywood had going for black people i thought about being an actress but dropped it years ago because i knew i wasnt going to waste time waiting around by the time i got into jamaica i had met young black people who went to classes right along with white people and took their dancing and singing lessons they didnt give up like i did i just said to heck with it im going to live the rest of my life like there is none of that and i did did you ever think of doing anything other than singing or acting no well i think the situation the divorce of my father and mother and the lack of any kind of family led me to work at the cotton club because my mother was ill and needed help and i started dancing to make a salary i never had any wish about being any particular thing because i was really so hung up about being alone until i was i was left around with everybody and i wanted a family and somebody to love and i didnt think about a career yeah i daydreamed when i was a little girl but i daydreamed about being accepted by people and a family because i was often left with people who had children of their own and i felt i was the odd one out of course once i got started in the club my mother was very encouraging and she thought i could be something but by then i was like years old and boy crazy and probably not even then was i career thinking when i got older i began to want to be good because there was nobody there but me i was with a very conscientious colored man who had been a first also and he made me so aware of having to be a certain way it was almost parental your parents tell you to be good be good so i saidall rightso im trying to sing so ill learn to be good ill learn to dance well so that i dont embarrass anybody i still was not really hung up with myself about it then after i married louis jones and came back to work again i met people whom i loved and admired like billie holiday and nat cole wanted to be in their circle i wanted to be worthy of being with them and because i was in a place that had only me i was very conscious of having to be good the old thing youve got to be better so that was the groove for the longest time then when i met lennie and began to relax in a very difficult second marriage i started to think about singing as a career before it paid the bills now it was a career and many things about it interested me particularly because i was free to relax personally but i was still conscious of being the only one in california in pictures at that time but i could get away from it in an association with lennie and i began to travel and sing in places where it didnt impress them so much that this was a black woman singing my first trip to europe around gave me that feeling that they were more impressed by my talent than color i was beginning to get it at the copa but in europe i didnt feel so much a freak today im very comfortable about my career but im bored really with what i used to do i sing now and i dont have to prove anything out there you see the thing is that i know my blackness i have not found it easy to show it through singing or many other things but nobody can take that away from me and i enjoy the music that is happening so much now i would like to feel that joy could never approximate the freedom of sound that aretha franklin my favorite singer has i never had any church background except the catholic church and i dont mean its a religion thing but its a freedom of expression that the black person always had if he went into his own church and i was never able to have that i want to say and sing now with more freedom because i feel it in myself the pattern of the songs that i sang before just are not like that they are not free they are uptight they are about unreal situations now arethashe sings a song called you make me feel like a natural woman and i suppose all the years that i disciplined myself to keep in control and not show my feelings the way i many times resented an audience or the way i sometimes had been angered by something that had happened i couldnt express that feeling but she is so free and feminine and warm and you know that she has put no barrier in front of her she isnt pleading or begging to the audience she isnt even denying them she is pouring out this freedom if they want itthere it is and just the look of peoples faces when they listen to her shows that she is sending out such warmth she is sending out evervthing i think is best in a black woman pride warmth the knowledge at this young time of her life that she is free in herself she has made no compromises to hide what she was or to change it or to put it in a stylized frame she is just herself she makes me glad fm a woman she makes me feel warmer toward people and its very hard in this business to be feminine if you havent got that kind of drive that searching for applause lor wiping out your audiemce and that ego to feel being applauded youre rather vulnerable i went into the business for necessity most of all rather than with that drive and i had to protect myself in it because its run essentially by cold ruthless people owners management people who didnt understand and didnt know you as a black person from whom you hid certain things whom you said you would never let see through you or let get control of you and you build up this wall around you and even if you have that ego and drive and a tough skin its difficult to stay womanly because youre out there competing in a mans world a tough world but you have always stayed womanly always beautiful how did you do it i prepared myself when i was about i started preparing to be middle aged and grow older lennie always laughed at my seriousness about it i thought about it consciously because at home with my family and the people i love the feeling never comes to me about age but i knew that i had to get ready for old age because of the profession and the outside world so i was all set and married with lennie and working and the children were growing up and i began to think about aging what it was going to be like and what it was going to mean i never had that drive that urge to be a star so i didnt think age would hurt me too badly as long as i realized there was a certain length of time for my career maybe not if i started to go longer perhaps i could but in case i couldnt i knew that there were other things i guess disillusion very early in my life helped me prepare for what would be a normal process of growing older and which should be but isnt often allowed to be in this business first there was the disillusion that i would during my time go a certain way and no further never got starryeyed about anything because for me it couldnt happen it couldnt happen that i was going to be a big black movie star it couldnt happen that i would ever feel comfortable with the favors that were given me the tokenism about my careeri never felt comfortable at the beginning in it and as i grew older i still didnt so i wasnt blinded by it but i have the same problems everyone else has i have to diet very carefully and i also exercise but hate it about every two months ill lie down and do d bicycle exercises but then what happens is that i forget about the skin being thin and i get sore burns on my backsidewhich is pretty stupid the difficult thing now at my time of life with dieting is that the places where you dont want it to come off you lose quickly and only rigid kinds of exercises get it off the heavy spots once in a while i get to the pool i dont know how to swim im terrified of water but i hold on to the side of the pool and kick ive been trying to ride a bike since my husband gave me one for my birthday when i was but i havent learned how to i balance myself at alli always fall off i told lennie i want him to attach some little trainer wheels to it ive also picked up a couple of those isometric exercises but theyre difficult we were talking about dieting but its not always a great pleasure to be good looking you know for a long time this beauty thing was a hangup because i never knew until i could honestly admit to myself that i could sing a little bit whether i pleased a large spectrum of the audience or not i couldnt dance or sing worth a damn when i was hired at the cotton club but i had gotten in there because i was young attractive i had no talent i had nothing but looks and i was taught very early by a black man tiny bradshaw not to get any conceit about beauty because he told me quite frankly that there were thousands of other black women who looked as good as i did and better who didnt get the chance when i got a job the first time an important job in cafe societyi knew i had a road to haul black men helped me thereteddy wilson j c hurd all of the men who j taught me to sing and helped me professionally i was still being hired because i looked good and when i went to california it kept me from being in any of the molds they were allowing negro people to be in when you have time to relaxwhat do you do earlier in my career i never had time to go out too much socially with the outside world now i do but not in california there im in a sort of sloppy syndrome because in palm springs people dont get dressed and you dont go out too much t also read a lot i eat books i like everythingth th century f european things murder mysteries autobiographies particularly autobiographies malcolms is my bible im still reacting from it and i read it about four years ago i felt that kind of charisma that kind of possession of self when he was around he was somebody very strong i loved him i really did i would only see him at a distance i never to my knowledge spoke to him but someone told me that i had met i him a long time ago in chicago under his old name it was such a i powerthats what fascinated me about his story i could feel it from i people in the street see it in whole neighborhoods its amazing to i feel that kind of powerthe power for such good there were so many people who needed that kind of power he became a saint in the inspiration that he pushed out to us paul robeson had that same kind of effect im sorry he isnt here now with all his strength and virility he was physically a handsome beautiful man ive been fighting about him with black people since i was the fights that i had were not because they were accusing him of selling out they were accusing him of caring too much about them and probably upsetting the boatthey didnt want him to earlier you mentioned religion are you religious i dont feel very religious i guess but then i dont really know what religion is in the beginning i left the catholic church because i felt herded into certain attitudes then when i married my first husband i became a baptist and i think i only did that because it pleased him ery much and i enjoyed being in the baptist church i dont believe it made me become godly or aware of god it kind of soothed my spirit on sunday i liked what it sounded like and i liked the people i liked being together with my own people it ga e me strength but in a catholic church you can be in a crowd of them white people and be alone the catholic churchs background never never had to do with anything that concerned black people really lennie is not particularly religious so ixe not found a faith i would rather hae heard somebodv like medlar evers or martin_luther_king talk that makes sense to me i dont actually live by any moral or religious code mine is more a kind of respect for the individual i dont know what kind of code that is i believe in the dignity of human beings dont mean it as poetic as it sounds you attended dr_kings funeral what were you thinking as you marched to morehouse college i was angry i got very angr when it happened you think jesus well theyve killed another one of my princes you know and i cant stand the way theyre im losing my people i have no thing about forgiving which is a bad thing in me im sure i wanted to be there because i wondered if that feeling that kind of compassion that he liad that aura that came out would soften me up a little bit i didnt hate but i was very aware of the antagonism and genuine anger and dislike i had im still angr im frustrated about it each day that goes by and they havent done anything about it like capturing the murdereryeah i think people should be punished for what they do when these murders happen when they take something away from so many people i resent it i havent gotten together about it yet they annoy me by their i know its a violent country and people are killing each other all over the place but this is different a different kind of feeling to me its so indicative of some of their belief that they can do anything they chckse thats what disgusts me its that arrogance they take it for granted this right they ha e to spoil tilings but i find strength because im black i just think if i were white in these days at any time in these past years i think i would knock myself off i think i couldnt survive if i were like those people i feel i have more at stake in life than they do i know its because im black the stake is that id want a black woman now who is years younger than i to miss all that crap or a man at the age of my son to be able to be free and not as hung up i still have that faith but the whites have eerything or they at least assume they have it they dont even want anything they dont even want to change i cant see their goal i can see that they dont want to stop being the richest country in the world and they dont really want to do some healthy things about blacks and whites they have money and the opportunity for them is ahvays still there so there is nothing for them to want evidently still want i think its because im black that i can still want the only thing that a good decent people can hope for is that they will become better i dont know whether they can my son teddy works out in california in the watts labor communication center and hes with and yearold black men who dont want terribly extraordinary things and who are still without the simple things simple things like not being frisked one of my black friends a choreographer was stopped by cops in beverly hills the other day because some white woman said shed been robbed by a black man they had no description but he was a black man he had just left me and gone around the corner its a simple desire to be able to walk down the street and not be insulted do you think race relations will ever improve well some of it will come with intermarriage but i dont think better relationship is any longer the most important thing i think the biggest shock white people felt is that we dont like them that we dont love them really i guess they never gave a damn about it i think its beginning to bother them now theyre aware lets put it that way their action before was that they werent aware i welcome this awareness but i dont think its going to be important much longer whether were togetherexcept that their money is important i tliink money will become more and more important i really agree with jimmy brown about black men in business together because then oure less dependent i think the money is going to be important i dont know about property there are not too many things left to buy in your book lena you talked about the black man and how he had been emasculated by the matriarchal black woman do you still feel that way i still find quite a bit of hangover from the past white society hired the black woman and stumped the black man they created this whole thing and they sustained it but the role of the black man is being changed tlirougli the niovenient for one thing so i think the black male still has a bit of catching up to do for his image s sake but black men are assuming the leadershipthere will be another dr_king there has to be there is another malcolm_x we have stokely black women are beginning to have an obvious pride in their husbands as black men they especially the young ones are able to be a part of their husband theyre willing to take the chance with him the young black woman isnt under all that old stress she doesnt have to be taking care of those babies and trying to get out and make a living because hes so hung down that he cant make it in a white world these young black people dont have that fear anymore theyre taking their lead you talk about being black youve marched on washington in selma you ve been a longtime fund raiser for civil_rights yet a lot of people feel you dony identify with blacks why i dont know why well i know myself now in a way that i never did before i know what i am i dont know how to say it its too obvious to say that i am a black woman because it means so many different things and i always was black but now im free im free to enjoy being black for one thing its very difficult to be stared at and be its such a drag to be a godamn credit and thank god i mean we dont have to use that word anymore i dont have to be a credit i can be me im only not proud of myself as lena horne but im proud of myself as lena home black woman i really am im not like anybody else im not the imitation of white women that hollywood tried to make me i dont care what i look like im not imitation im me black me its a different dimension i used to react before as an american and then as a negroi just react now as black first of all we should really admit the fact that i was one of those symbols they said at the time i got the job with mgm in that they were going to prove through me that were all alike they made me up and down they decided the way they thought at first i should look they decided how a negro should look at that time it was a negro like rochester or ethel waters or louise or hattie tlien they discovered that i looked made up to be something so they decided to let me look as i looked but even when they developed this makeup that matched my skin they tried to make me look as close to white as possible and they still proceeded to allow white women to play the parts that a black woman looking like me might have played and this went on it never stopped in reverse what they did was name me in all their releases the sepia hedy lamarr now that in itself is an affront i wouldnt have minded if theyd said she hedy lamarr is a white lena home that never happened it was a stultifying experience i lived kind of suspended in the atmosphere somewhere i wasnt grounded on my own patch of dirt and neither on theirs and as these months passed and years went by i had to make a living at the only thing i knew i worked in cabarets by that time a rebellion against the white mold they had put me in made me create a kind of mold that nothing could get to i was ice so that nothing could touch me again and i went on like this and i made a marriage and i raised my children and i worked all over the world and i just got into a nit because i didnt want anything they had and i was alsoon account of this imageremoved from my own people and went to sleep with my emotions i just fell asleep then a few years ago i banged that white man in his head in the luau in hollywood i went home and went to bed and the next morning there was all that mailtelegrams telephone calls the pressfrom black people who said how wonderful i cant tell you what a shock that was to me because i didnt think anybody cared i had lost sight of the fact that i had ties with my own people i told lennie it shocked me soi told him but i always get mad this isnt the first time ive had a fight because of some insult from a white person but it was the first time it happened when a newspaper man was right there and the guy was pretty blxdy lennie said well darling i guess maybe your people just dont know that you feel that way then i realized how important it was that they do i dont know whether it was important to them but i knew it was for me i had i felt like i had some kinfolks it was the first sign of identification that i felt i had always been militant and i got angr like a lot of other black people but it was never in any place that anybody knew about because i was completely in that white world reacting as a black woman then after all those telegrams and letters i knew the bond was there it had always been there but i had never reached out to it now i felt it and i physically brought myself close to my own people i began to probe deeper and deeper into myself and i began speaking out and people thought i was becoming more militant but i had always been now i began to share that militancy with my other black sisters and brothers my anger now is not so personal i know now that it is a shared anger i was always made angry but i was alone in my anger now i dont mind channelling that anger along with other people because ive found its use but before it was just a killing process it was not a creative anger at all a frustration now i can use it i think i feel more creative in it whtm greensboro happened with all that those young black men and women went through i was in torment and i felt so bad and so pained i knew i was awake again i wasnt just reacting automatically i had been dead for so long but those students made me live again it was really a metamoqhosisi cant use any other word for it it was like i was bom again the new me hasnt been comfortable for many of the people that knew me before the few that thought they knew me before particularly the white people would say youve changed something has happened to you something hadthose young brave students in the south i had never seen that i bad been around scared black people black men put down black women called bosses and matriarchs so much then i met medgar e ers and be had a fantastic effect upon me i had never been around black men like thatnow i know thevre all over the worldliving breathing brave black men i had been around black men very close to me billy strayhom and other musicians in particular but they were all artists artistsblack or whitelive in another bag really and its a painful bag too as i began to identify more with black people it also began to have an effect on my husband now lennie is strange mystic almost in the very beginning when we met put him to tests dont think an ordinary white man would have put up with it in many moments of anger id come from the outside world and id take it out on him everything that white people had made me feel and id say yes you always raped us been with us ever since we were brought here but youd never marry us he from the very beginning said but i want to marry you and i knew it was unfair because i was testing him and he put up with it and we married the sheer strength of his feeling toward me made me begin to be able to perform to work he was gentle with me he was patient he tried always to understand he began to react he began to be able to tell when my reaction was from a racial thing or something else and i could be tender and keep myself married to him and not be tough and colder than i was in the business and he helped musically because i knew nothing about music now about five years ago when i started going through these changes i took a very desperate chance i had had one unsuccessful marriage and im not a person who likes to be a failure in a relationship with a man but i took a chance i said lennie im going through some changes as a black woman i cant explain them i dont know what theyre going to mean what theyre going to do to me but ive got to be by myself to work it outto think about it and believe it or not he had to make a very big change himself he had been working with me we had built a little ivory tower where we had traveled together we were together every minute our social life what little of it after work our daytime activities sleep eat rehearse work he had to go back into a profession he had left back to conducting and writing for movies back to the talent that i fell in love with him really for he had to in effect be tested againand i owe lennie a great deal i needed to be alone and lennie and i were apart for about three yearshe on the coast i in new york we saw each other but most of the time we spent separately during those years we were apart i wrote a book i got out on the road with my own people with the national council of negro women speaking to black women in the south the time away wasnt easy for lennie or me but our marriage has simived we have something it shows that it is something we didnt want to give up lightly lennie has also changed now he has always been one of the few people who has absolutely nothing about color i sometimes tease him because he becamein a wayblack for instance lennie is beginning to relate to race attitudes on his own not because hes married to me other black people have made him feel this he is a man who has no prejudice but it is no longer enough not to be prejudiced he has done two or three very independent things politically with white people as well as black people in los angeles recently the separation we went through it was a desperate chance but i think weve worked it out and i can remain married to him we have grown more and more to respect and understand each other my children are grown and i dont think id be the type of woman who would enter into a light relationship now i essentially feel married and the fact that lennie has learned about my feeling of race as i have seems to me that we still have something to do together it was during those years before i left i was beginning to see him as white which i hadnt done in the beginning before i saw him just as lennie but because my senses had sharpened toward what was growing in my own country and my feelings i knew that that was bad i knew that was an unhealthy sign so i had to get away to think it out when you went to atlanta for the funeral your husband was not with you no as close as we are when that happened and when medgar happened and even when malcolm was killed i needed to be with my own people its strange i never really tried to psyche it out and its probably selfish of me too because im sure that lennies grief was as deep as mine but my own anger about martins death just wiped out any kind of feeling of logic id forgotten about lennie and im sure that showed i didnt let him share in my anger and i should have so when i came back we talked about it and i said im sorry i left the way i did and i wished you were with me there but i dont know whether he really could have come i dont like to make some of my own people ive found sometimes they are uncomfortable and in a situation as personal as martins funerali cant help but feel personal about the deaths of medgar and martin ive got to because theyre minesome peoples nerves are sometimes exacerbated by seeing the color they dont know as i do what a decent man lennie is and you dont have time in a situation like that to explain its selfish of me probably but i wanted to be alone in that kind of grief you have talked about the past and the present where do you go from here i dont know tlie pressures are not the same im not fighting now with such a feeling of frustration i feel more now i like a few more leople im not afraid to like them it does not necessarily mean that ive enlarged my circle of friends ive always been oriented towards small groups but tve opened myself to more people and i feel less a sense of isolation im more loving ive been so afraid of it all my life because i didnt have it earlier even when i began to have it i never believed in it lennie for years i didnt believe in how deep his love was i didnt want anything to hurt me or touch me so i didnt let it show my love and now i do im very happy about gail it was very thrilling to me for gail to have children really i was all ready for that in fact it is a very selfish feeling i have about the grandchildrenhers and teddys it makes me feel ive done something i guess its the egotistical end but its just a sense of wonder to sec a part of me there gail and i have grown much closer i guess that happens with all mothers and daughters it takes a while and so have teddy and i he speaks to me now of things that happened with him as a little boy when i wasnt around i know he must have had lonely moments moments when he probably wasnt reassured that i loved him as i did since he has had his children as a parent we are closer now i love him its so difficult to tell people you know that you do but i think he understands now he knows how much it means to me because when he writes to me he takes time to writehes busyand its such an intense thrill to me professionally im doing things i want to i havent sung in a night club for about a year and a half the last time in reno i had to cut down because of an allergy i have to air conditioning i also had developed before i quit an allergy to the glue you use to put on false eyelashes im doing a special in august in canada that harry belafonte will produce i may do some more acting i dont know im very happy now and i dont think too much about the future im prone to a kind of melancholia quite frequently so ive been always extra happy if everything was kind of half well because ive never left jnyself open for too much disappointment i used to say didnt care when i died that i would never be one of those people who wanted to stay around now i feel like i wouldnt like to die because im enjoying a great many things that i hadnt for so many years i feel good i feel great i feel loved im very happy i guess why do you say guess because im so afraid of it you know p anafricanism the muse of black confidence storied so much these days in blood and tears barred cells and hot words fashioned a gay phrase last month in the suburban new york home of akili b c danieli the tanzanian ambassador there to celebrate their threeweek old marriage came the trinidadborn civil_rights and black_power advocate stokcly carmichael and south africas most famous woman a fighter in her own right miriam makeba this was no ordinary wedding reception guinea ambassador achkar marof who cohosted the event set the tone by hailing the marriage as the beginning of stronger ties between black people on both sides of the atlantic during the africanstyle ceremonies the rev douglass e moore a washington d c methodist minister whom stokely calls his personal pastor offered prayers to both deceased african tribesmen and american slaves and miriam who later drew jubilant applause as she led a combo and chorus through four rousing songs from her motherland stilled the guests with a hymn beseeching her tribal ancestors to bless her marriage the guest list testified to the unity theme of the event it included representatives of free african nations afroamerican jazz musicians black ghetto businessmen and militants and a score of the worlds few decent white people but in the midst of a seeming marriageofcontinents miriam set the record stiaight people have given a number of reasons for our marriage she said oddly no one has thought of love t he national urban league has always been concerned about black people but rarely has it gone directly into the ghetto to help them instead the league and its affiliates throughout the country ha e generally stood midway between downtowm and uptown serv ing as intermediary between the needs of the blacks and the contributions of whites the method for a long time proved practical but that was before black people in the ghetto started getting themseb es together either tlirough riots or antipoverty agencies which sought to organize them politically and economically rather than violently as a result the urban league which for so long has been the spokesman for much of black america particularly in tenns of jobs housing and education is now faced with black people who want to be their ow n spokesman to present their owm demands to white people who can do something about their needs what has also happened says urban league executive director whitney young is that white america has been sufficiently aroused stimulated frightened whatever it might be to want to talk directly now with black america at one time the establishment woidd only talk with selected negro leadership such as the league now we no longer need to be the power broker our role now is to be the convenerto arrange those confrontations between black and white america to make the change from power broker to convener the national urban league is turning its stad and energies toward the ghetto in a new thrust to prepare black america for creative and constructive confrontations watb the white establishment and power stnicture the thrust is based on the assumption that downtowai officials either are committed to making some changes and to opening up jobs or they can best be urged to do thisif they hax en tthrough effective organization and presentation of the facts by organized ghetto communities tlic power structure is ready to talk to black people directly says chief brokertumedconvener young but they don t know in many cases whom to talk to he recounts experiences where businessmen hae been contacted by selfappointed leaders and they thought the person was tlie leader because he was loud and black and cnide and he probably had ten people as followers nine of them members of his family if the establishment is ready to talk then the urban league feels it is entitled to get from the black community authentic spokesmen people who have been elected by their communities neighborhoods and blocks to speak for them the league remembers that the labor unions went through the same adjustment and that it wasnt until they had elections and selected their leadership did management know with whom it could negotiate the confrontations directly between white and black america lure inevitable young says we already liax e them but theyre not organized and the spokesmen are unable to authenticate their leadership in addition theyre unable to document the needs of the community and their presentations are not handled in such a way as to be taken seriously but we intend to hae meaningful confrontations instead of shouting matches where whites say you folks go and get educated and blacks holler back well you educate us just why the national urban league decided to move into the black ghettos now and not yesterday or tomorrow is explained on one hand by the mood of the country in the wake of riots assassinations the kemer commission charge of white racism and a reactionarx congress and on the other hand by the commitment of business and industry through the urban coalition and the national alliance of businessmen to do something about the plight of the ghetto other phenomena also have been identified by the league as contributing to the countrys changing climate in reaction to events of recent months the league sees more soid searching going on now than ever before in churches and economic and social institutions it also notes the rexolt of the young who express contempt and cynicism about the lack of priorities that ha e been established in the value system of this country they are completely disgusted young says with a society that spends per cent of its resources for killing people or defending themselves from destruction but will spend less than per cent of the national budget for health education and welfare then there is the fact that for the first time business establishmentsnot for moral or patriotic reasons the league stresses but for their own enlightened self interesthav e decided to get inv olved in the ghettos these men have looked at the hard economic facts of segregation that the deprived and the denied cost a whole lot more when we dont educate them and dont employ them they now recognize the economic and political implications of cities that become blacker and poorer the most important change hovvever has been the recognition by the urban league that the determination on the part of the disinherited blacks to better their condition is real we will be the servants of black people to the extent that our resources permit us to really move them into the mainstream else there wont be any mainstream young vvarns the echoes we hear in the ghetto of liberate me or exterminate me are sincere given such a climate and reasons for change the league knows it vvould be irresponsible in fact criminal if its affiliates and lulltime staff members in major cities in the country did not put their lesources to work in order to capitalize on the new climate three months ago the national urban league called an emergency twoday meeting of top professional and volunteer league officials from across the nation into new york to formalize the new thrust the league would be taking and to emphasize that the thrust did not mean eliminating programs but rather adding on to them the league is not overlooking its past successes last year alone more than people vverc placed in jobs which add up to millions of dollars of income another people were upgraded to jobs that were fitting for their qualifications and there are now some to people who are in onthejob training programs the new thrust one league official says does not mean giving up our role of job development housing and all the other things that we have been doing we will continue to work in shaping policy in both private and public sectors as we have always done were still making new laws and still are gungho on getting a domestic marshall plan in this countiy worried that the new thrust might signify a change of emphasis within the league its chicago director edwin berry has suggested that it be called a twin thrust which would more accurately reflect the leagues concern with both the black ghetto and its continued theme of interracial cooperation which has characterized it since its founding in in fact the urban league has stressed that its new thrust will have three dimensions the major one will be the actions on the part of local leagues to engage primarily in community organization the people in each community will select the major problem be it garbage collection streetlights recreation or education once the community has decided the priorities then the league through its research and knowhow will provide the documentation necessary to make the case assist in the preparation of it for presentation and thenstaying in the backgroundprovide direct confrontation with appropriate officials the type of confrontation a new york league staffer explains in which we dont stand and sing we shall overcome without being able to specifically document not only our demands but what the situation requires and why we must ha e it equally important to the league will be its move to involve more middle class negroes with their black brothers i believe that desire is present in unprecedented degree asserts young he recalls his recent experience at yale university where members of the black student alliance were critical of the middle class but he pointed out that within three blocks of yale little black boys were growing up without fathers how many of you angry concerned new black militants have gone down and taken one of them and brought them to a yale football game or have gone down to be a big brother the students admitted they hadnt but that they wanted to do something they said they didnt know what to do and thats our fault we havent provided them with the machinery through which they can meaningfully relate to the black community now the league is finding the machinery this summer it will bring black leaders from to prcdominantly black and white colleges into new york for a week or two of orientation on economic development lrograms that can be used in the black commimity for training they will be sent to urban league cities to work on programs including consumer education and cooperative development hopefully they will go back to college says project director johnny parham pass the word onto their black brothers and get them to work in the ghetto on an ongoing basis throughout the summer and school year another way the league will continue to involve the middle class is tlirough its leadership program now operating in cities for some three years the league has been picking out middle class blacks for civic leadership to serve on city boards and planning agencies and to also prepare them for political life the mayors of springfield ohio and flint mich both came through the leagues leadership development program but theyre the exceptions the chicago urban league recently completed a study on negroes in policymaking positions in that city and found that only about two per cent are in the power structure although negroes account for about per cent of the population the average negro only knows about the city council and school boards explains mrs betty whaley who is in charge of the leadership program he doesnt know about the countless other ones that exist we have the leadership meetings just to train middle class negroes in how a city functions and how through their participation in the civic and political processes they can help people in the ghetto while it concentrates on the middle class and organizing the black communities the league cannot ignore white america when plans for the new thrust were unveiled at the specially called meeting one white board member asked young if it meant that the league would no longer serve as a bridge of understanding between the races yoimg answered that we are saying to our white board members that with your great resources you hav e go to do something about white racism and until we eliminate this sickness we all are in trouble we dont get invited into these pockets of bigotry such as cicero a chicago suburb and yet weve got to change them he says white board members must also provide the technical assistance so desperately needed in black communities as more and more blacks assume leadership roles and ownership of property in their community by moving our ofrces into the ghetto we will not be moving away from whites we will not be separating and doing just an all black operation but we must be in the ghetto to serve it young is willing to work with white america but he demands commitment im no longer concerned about expressions of grief and about what white people felt after the murders of dr martin_luther_king and sen robert kennedy he says im concerned about what white people are doing the best way to show me they dont share collective guilt for these murders is to show me some collective positive action he adds that he has no intention of going into die ghetto telling black people to be nonviolent and patient just for the sake of doing so any negro leader can only be effective to the point he can bring tangible things into the ghetto as part of the new thrust planned by the urban league young also noted plans for the study of white people in america we need to see whats wrong with white people he explains people who live in neighborhoods like cicero and bronxville new york and see why they are so afraid why they want their children to grow up in sterile antiseptic bland ghettos the league also sees need for studies on white institutionsreligious educational and politicaland on congress the league says the studies will be a good way to provide employment for blacks with tongue in cheek it notes that whites have been studying blacks and getting rich but who would be better equipped young asks than unemployed domestic workers to look at the souls of white folks they know them better than anybody they had to know them in order to survive white people are always telling me how much they love their maids and they really do confide in them so we could use them as researchers he would also call on unemployed black bellhops in washington to study the congressmen they could tell us a great deal about their behavior because they have ox er the years served them in their suites and in their hotels we could call this one the pathology of congress thus far the threedimensional thrust of the national urban league with its major emphasis on organizing black communities is not in existence as a national program except in the pronouncements of young and other officials the program will be up for general adoption at the end of this month when the league holds its annual conference in new orleans there delegates will have the program which has already been approved by the national urban league board of directors spelled out in detail anticipating approval by its broad membership the national urban league has been laying the foundation for the new thrust which is expected to cost million the first year million the next the ford foundation has already expressed a favorable interest in a million matching grant and the league will approach other foundations businesses and individuals for additional funding the new thrust operating as a separate unit of the national urban league will be called the community organization and developmental unit and will be spearheaded by civil_rights sharp shooter sterling tucker who will take a years leave as director of the washington urban league the choice of yearold tucker who recently coordinated the solidarity day march on washington for the southern christian leadership conference is natural it was tucker in fact in discussions with whitney young who conceptualized and developed the new thrust the urban league must take if it is to be relevant originally the league had planned to set up three model urban league programs in strategic locations which would serve as intraining centers for league executives to learn the latest techniques in organizing black communities but in view of events in the last six months tucker wondered if the league could really wait to try out just three centers instead of talking about a budget in three cities he felt the league would have to aim for million and for programs in all the cities it serves tucker knew what he was talking about he had already had success in washington with pride inc an organization which under the leadership of the colorful rufus catfish mayfield reached into the ghetto with notable succejjs uiuler tuckers direction and a staff of five to nine young executives drawn mostly from within the movement threefourths of the money for implementing the new thrust will be channeled directly by the national urban league to its affiliates marking the first time this has been done the rest of the money will come from local organiziitions which generally fund affiliate projects now the national urban league with million available to put into local branches will have a carrot and stick influence over local programming an advantage it has not had before the money will be there for the local leagues but in order to get it they will have to meet rigid criteria set by the national league this means they will not only have accepted the philosophy and intent of the new thrustlocal boards as well as staffbut will actually have begun to program more visibly and imaginatively in the ghetto they will physically have to move into the ghetto if not with their central office then with an outpost from which the new thrust will operate before we gie them the money young maintains we will visit them to see exactly what they are doing and whether they are actually committed to the new thrust or not each affiliate aided by the regional and national staff will design its own program tliat can best carry the new thrust into its local community a community suffering under unjust welfare laws might put together a coalition of ghetto residents and top lawyers to mount test cases to reform the system credit experts businessmen economists and lawyers might be enlisted by a community plagued by unfair credit practices to arrange confrontations with local merchants to effect wholesale revisions in the credit system in neighborhoods that could support blackowned or managed businesses or could profit from co operative purchasing plans professional advisors could be called in to help residents develop a broadbased economic action program designed to revamp the economic structure of the entire community the urban league expects some problems in implementing its new thrust there will be some local executives who have been pretty far remoned from the mass community and who have probably gotten comfortable just working with the establishment they will hae to have orientation i dont expect to have overnight success with urban leagues young says but i know right now we have about local leagues doing some of thisorganizing in th black ghettos and another to with these additional funds will begin to move jle stresses that in some cases where there is a group already organized outside the urban league the leagues technical assistance will be offered we dont want to duplicate or take over we dont want to monopolize the field the executive director says we dont want to threaten the authentic leadership of other organizations we want to work with them success of the new thrust will depend on the community and how well it is organized around problems which can be sok ed the success says one los angeles leaguer will be in initially picking out a problem that is curable in a short time so that the people will have a sense of success that through their organization and their selected leaders working with the urban league who convened the meetings with the authorities they ha e achie ed a ictory thats the secret of organization to do things and get them done give people a sense of accomplishment then they get confidence in themselves they see the value of organization some communities depending upon the power stnicture are expected to respond to the new thrust more readily than others results will also vary according to the projects the community takes on some city power structures including new york pittsburgh and st louis ha e been waiting for such a thrust and are ready to mo e st louis in fact was one of the first urban league areas to organize years ago with its neighborhood block associations other areas will probably have a greater thrust in organizing on a more aggressive level such as in rochester n y where the eastman kodak co has joined the local urban league in establishing a business enterprise engaged in testing repairing servicing and assembling cameras under a contract with the kodak co the parent company is supplying cameras providing training and creditall of which will lead to eventual ownership by ghetto residents programs such as the camera repair shops in rochester will be extended to other black communities as part of the new thrust and new programs will also be developed all aimed at giving blacks greater control in their communities and in developing them although the lrban league has not done too much in the ghettos before now the thrusts director tucker is not worried im verv satisfied that what people in the ghetto want is help from anybody who can and will sincerely want tg serv e he says they want us to come in understanding what has to be done they want us willing to accept them not to come in with a high and mighty attitude but to come and work with them to give them leadership roles and to allow them to make mistakes for everybody else has made mistakes in moving ahead the urban league does not repudiate its past role of power broker but the times ijave changed five years ago we could not do what we are talking about now says director young the times would not permit it now that things are different the league is moving directly in the direction of the change nobody who represents the enemy is remotely concerned about our lung power soul power fire power young maintains but about our political power ballot power and economic power which is possible if we are organized and the best place the league knows to organize black people is in the ghetto

he would not advise a black boy to fight in vietnam for this racist country he does not believe in this country its laws or its law enforcers what does he bedieve in hose country is this if black people do not share the responsibilities of their country side by side with their white countrymen how can black people expect to partake of the rewards one cannot wiiie out racial prejudice by force nor can it be done by logic this can be done by time and time alone people generally are moved more effectively by logic than by force force endangers their racists lives and the lives of their families and as chambers stated when a man comes to my community and he is going to endanger the life of my wife and my children he should die nd if it is w ithin my pow er i will kill him whites feel tlie same way the only difference is in the color of their skin another of his statements was yet black people doing ordinary reasonable peaceful things in this country are attacked by the police and the police are praised for it hat was so peaceful and reasonable about watts chicago and cities all over our nation no sitins demonstrations riots etc will ever convince the individual as to the worth of another individual this racial prejudice must be overcome by mutual friendship and mutual respect on an indiidual basis for who knows better my feelings and my prejudices than myself not whitc

rouge mich eniest w chambers article has me upset although i agree with him up to a point he seems to feel because evil is done to us we must therefore go out and inflict evil on others find this confused thinking mrs beverly g whitlock sewickley pa i must say that mr chambers is a man after my own heart the man expressed in words how a lot of black jxoplc feel all of tin black people that have been brainwashed by their white counterparts friends associates or whatever would le very wise to heed some of this adviee that has been placed before them and stop being too dignified to protect themselves and their families or being too much a christian to protect themselves tliere is no such thing as a person having to be a coward to be a christian mrs gladys dockery milwaukee wis the depth of mr chambers thought came through explicitly clear he made his point with eloquence anger pride and knowledge r douglas greenslee new haven conn i just have to applaud mr ernest w chambers for speaking for us all so eloquently before that congressional committee it is people like him who should be called before these committees instead of roy wilkins or whitney young and the likes of that bunch who never manage to tell it like it really is cynthia hedgepeth east orange n j two points of view i am a subscriber to your magazine and td like to protest the insults i receive every time read it not an issue goes by but that you refer to the caucasian race in the most insulting terms you publish letters and articles in every issue that refer to mhitey charley and honkie without batting an eye yet if you read so much as one letter or oikj article in any publication that referred to a nigger darkie or blackie youd have such a big crowd picketing the publication that it would take months to get it cleared up now i am not a racist i believe in treating every man as an individual no matter what his color i feel wc arc all americans not black wliite yellow or red so i am disgusted with your policy racism and prejudices are a twoedged sword you claim you are fighting to rid the countr of these two diseases yet you do a great deal to perpetuate the whole tiling when you print these words the majority of white people are bending over backwards to straighten things out old songs have bcen chained up words like darky and pickaninny hae been dropped library books tliat seem to cast

to keep the peace dont you think you too could bend a little subscrilxd to ebony to help understand my colored brothers more and i must say it has given me a completely new idea of some of younot all of it good i always thought of ebony as the colored life but i find that it is not under the cover of innocence you preach bigotry and violence i hope you realize it and stop it b l joiinson isle of palm s c i felt almost compelled to send you this letter take it for what it is worth to you for myself it is an expression of gratitude for your fine magazine which is receiv ed here at our convent for me it is like finding an oasis in the midst of a racially torn country from it i gain an appreciation and knowledge of the negro in ameriea which is not available through any other channel as you know t movies school text books especially history booksare sadly lacking in recording the many accomplishments of americas negro population accomplishments which i myself am only beginning to discover because this knowledge was not made available to me in school as the teacher of a fifth grade ckiss it is especially helpful to me since i hope i am teaching a generation of americansnegro and whitewho are going to learn to live in peace and brotherhood with one another the fine way in which your magazine shows the dignity and wortli of the american negro not only of the prosperous class but also of the poor who are struggling to ixlter their own little corner of the world should prove to be a powerful weapon in dispelling prejudice may cod bless you and grant you continued

there theirs is the nnnsnal distinction of ha ini gained prominence in the same industry the food indnstiy while working for the same company waldhaums inc one of the leading supermarket chains in the new york metropolitan area fortsc enyearold ernest brown jr and his younger brother by miniitcs george started at waldbaum s years ago as stockboys in true i loratio alger fashion they moed through the ranks to executive status with the chain that has some stores in the metropolitan area and annual sales exceeding million ernest whose title is vicepresident in charge of merchandising and sales was promoted to his position in one year before george was named assistant vicepresident in charge of store operations t he twins in their new positions stay constantly busy ernests job keeps him close to headquarters in garden city long island where his duties include insuring the effectiveness of store displays and checking advertising copy in his neat functionoriented office he meets a dailv influx of salesmen and promotion men because many routine coinpany activities are conducted under the sales and merchandising departments umbrella office personnel also come in an endless stream to ernests desk his secretary amy sielaff remarked everyone comes to him with their problems unlike his brother george has responsibilities which keep him mostly in the field overseeing daily operations at company branches in long island brooklyn queens staten island and new jersey he drives some miles a day visiting an average of five stores his habit is to visit all stores over a sixtoeight week period george is also responsible for overseeing the personnel who work in these stores and his recall of names and faces is so sharp that he seems to know every employe by name like ernest george has an air of authority about him a relaxed nononsense approach to his job they both have to make dozens of routine but important decisions about the operations of the stores and neither exhibits the slightest hesitancy nor lack of confidence in making these decisions the brothers proudly wear their year pins on their jacket lapels having started when waldbaums owned only two grocery stores in brooklyn they have grown with the company at the age of right out of high school the twins joined waldbaums as stockboys they had heard about the jobs from a friend of their mothers and since this was depression time they considered themselves lucky to be working ernest remembers i went from picking up pound cases in to checking out customers in it was unheard of then for a colored checker to be in a white neighborhood it was even unheard of for a colored checker to be in a colored neighborhood the twins recall that from the beginning people have had trouble telling them apart even though he wears a pencilthin mustache because i got tired of being mistaken for ernest george says people will come to him and ask about an order promised to theman order he knows nothing about because the person who promised it was ernest there is a compensation though he tells of the people who have borrowed money from ernest and then mistakenly paid it back to him when this happens he jests i just keep the money the brown twins are like most identical twins only more so they have the same taste in clothesat work they wear the same style suits fortunately in different colorsin entertainment food and hobbies they are jazz enthusiasts and love to play cards especially bid whist a game in which as partners they are considered unbeatable ellen browm georges wife of years says they are so in tune with each other when partners in a card game that most people wont allow them to play together even ernest admits we have such a feeling for each other we can anticipate each others moves tliey love to play cards and golf because ernest notes cards and golf are forms of relaxation which require total concentration and as such drive out any thoughts of problems on the job unlike many identical twins who try to stress their differences as they grow older the browns stress their likenesses and seem to thriv e on their closeness their alikeness extends right down to the makeup of their families each has one child a son georges son richard a year old graduate of the uiiiversity of nebraska is currently a lieutenant in the army and ernests son ronald an year senior at the peekskill military academy in peekskill new york has been accepted for admission to nebraska in the fall during their lours of duty in the army the twins were separated for the first time ernest was sent to rome n y and george to texas a quick letter from their mother to army authorities lamenting the separation of her twins soon remedied the situation george was dispatched to rome and the two brorfiers haent been apart since as waldbaums expanded into a chain after tlie war the brown twins began their climb they are extremely loyal to waldbaums because they feel that the company has repaid their loyalty and hard work by promoting them on their merits rejecting any suggestion that they were promoted for show the twins emphasized that although only one of waldbaums so stores is in a predominantly black areathat one being the initial brooklyn store in a neighborhood which has changed from jewish to negrothe chain has black store managers and black assistant managers ernest remembers that to the late israel waldbaum the companys founder color was of no significance as long as you produced everything was all right he categorically denies the oftenrepeated rumor that israel waldbaums will made provision for him and his brother this is a business ernest states and if we couldnt do the job we wouldnt be here nd though a negro vicepresident in a supermarket chain is still very much of a rarity the twins dont feel that they has e achieved anything that other black men cannot especially in todays political economical and social environment buyers and salesmen from out of town are often surprised when those importantsounding men they speak to on the telephone turn out to be black but as george laconically observes they quickly adjust when they realize that we can make decisions which will affect their pocketbooks ernest remembers one salesman who was so shocked to see him that it took fie minutes and a trip to the store manager to convince him that ernest was a genuine vicepresident george claims that he can always tell when a person is surprised to see him he fumbles and comes out with a civil_rights statement george sayshow wonderful sammy davis is what a great guy jackie robinson ishe doesnt realize that bv doing this it makes it twice as hard for him to sell me on his product neither twin can remember anyone dropping an order when they made the big discov ery the twins who were born in richmond va and reared in brooklyn live quietly in new yorkgeorge in st albans and ernest on long island they hav e three brothers one of whom is head of store operations for a small sstore supermarket chain their father lives in retirement in riclimond the current success of the brovvm twins did not come easily and quickly as betty brown a school teacher to whom ernest has been married for years recalls when i used to see ernest and george working so hard i wondered if it was worth it but now that their hard work has been recognized i guess it was despite their amazing likenesses george after a long deliberation finally remembered one area of major diflerence between him and ernest says george playing the cardsharp our major disagreement is over ernests mistaken belief that he can beat me in rummy w hen in a calmer time men sit clown to write the definitive history of our era when they dig beneath the surface for the roots of black resistance when they dig down deep for the soothsayers and prophets who mirrored our times by anticipating our times it seems likely that they will focus on william monroe trotter a bold and brilliant agitator who is virtually unknown today ignored by a written history which skims the surface and misses the deeper currents underneath trotter is nevertheless honored by a living history which has confirmed his prophetic judgments and insights a true pioneer decades ahead of his time trotter laid the first stone of the modern protest mo ement it was trotter who mobilized the forces that checked the triumphant advance of booker t washingtons program of accommodation and submission it was trotter who opened a new cycle of stniggle by making the first faltering steps in the direction of direct action and mass mobilization looking back on trotter years after his death william harrison said in the negro history bulletin that he was a figure of national and even international significance and eminence who made five major contributions he startled the nation by challenging booker t washington at the outset of his career he defied president woodrow wilson when the latter instituted segregation of negroes employed in offices of the federal government in washington he threw down the gauntlet against racial discrimination on a world scale when he interened at the versailles peace conference in he pioneered in the staging of picket lines to protest plays derogatory to the negro people he was the first american negro leader to organize mass struggle on issues with national and international significance since the days of frederick douglass and the abolitionists what makes this record all the more remarkable is that trotter was a black blueblood the son of james monroe trotter a leading intellectual and politician he was born on april he never knew hunger or want nor did he experience the brutal aspects of oppression in america he was raised in a posh home in the predominantly white boston suburb of hyde park he attended the predominantly white hyde park schools and moved on with his affluent peers to harvard university from which he was graduated in magna cum latide in he received an ma degree from harvard w e b du bois was one of his distant acquaintances at harvard but the two students differed considerably in temperament and orientation both were loners but they were loners in different ways which is another way of saying that they suffered differently after graduating from harard with honors and a phi beta kappa key trotter married the socially prominent geraldine pindell and settled down to a promising career as a real estate broker there stretched before him then a bright vista of achievement in the echelons of the black elite but this vision seemed somehow despicable to trotter who was haunted by the creeping misery of the black masses most members of the black elite believed they could fight racism as individuals by proving that they were clean rational and respectable this orientation which was based on the onebyone admission of whitewashed blacks into american society repelled trotter who saw clearly that black people were oppressed collectively and that a collective effort was necessary to destroy this oppression he was particularly exercised by the horatio algier individualism of booker t washington the antiprotest leader who dominated tlie headlines of the day looking back on that period later trotter said the conviction grew upon me that pursuit of business money civic or literary position was like building a house upon the sands if race prejudice and persecution and public discrimination for mere color was to spread up from the south and result in a fixed caste of color i realized that the democracy which i had enjoyed at dear old harvard was not secure for americans of color just because of their pigmentation it would mean that however native and to the manner born every colored american would be really a civil outcast forever an alien in the public life so trotter continued i plunged in to contend for full equality in all things governmental political civil and judicial as far as race creed or color was concerned i opposed all compromise whether advocated by professor booker t washington or president william howard taft to say nothing of race oppression as advocated by senator benjamin tillman with scarcely a backward glance trotter repudiated the pretensions of the black elite and embraced a collective vocation of liberation why did trotter give up the rich red meat of elitehood for the lean fare of agitation in other words why do some men choose the underdogs when their credentials entitle them to a seat at the table of upperdogs the obvious answer is that an unjust world requires demands the sacrifice of the just even more importantly the friction provided by men like trotter is necessary for the health of society which clings tenaciously to the old and the safe but this view is rejected by many men who seek the causes for the transformation of the trotters of the world in psychological eventsin unhappy childhoods personal frustrations and delayed rebellions against remembered fathers like almost all radicals trotter was accused of raising hell for the sake of raising hell protofreudians said he lashed out at the environment in an unconscious effort to provoke the punishments and the isolation he desired but these answers were at worst fatuous and at best ideological justifications for the status quo trotter rejected for if personal frustration and unhappy childhoods produced radicals most of the people in the world would be radical it would be better perhaps to confront the mystery of men like trotter by admitting frankly the close connection between the personal and the social between private troubles and social troubles this explanation does not exclude personal projectsdifferences in temperament sensitivity and reaction to critical life experiences but it insists upon the close connection between the man and the situation and it emphasizes the ideological assumptions of the question why do some men become radicals in a world shot through with oppression and injustice in a world where most people do not have enough to eat where most people are illiterate and diseased would it not be more logical to ask why arent all men radicals trotter asked that question at the turn of the century he couldnt understand why so many black men were silent in the face of so much misery he couldnt understand why so many educated black men supinely accepted the submissive program of booker t washington and he decided to trouble the water by shattering the conspiracy of silence the white power structure had imposed on a new generation which was restive under the weight of the powerful washington macliine aided by george forbes another welleducated member of the boston elite trotter founded the boston guardian in and dedicated his life to the destruction of booker t washington and the idea washington represented significantly trotter established the guardian on the same hoor in the same building which had housed william lloyd garrisons liberator the motto of the guardian was for every right with all thy might booker t washington responded to the trotter campaign with a ruthlessly efficient campaign of harassment he tried first to silence trotter by subsidizing another boston newspaper and by encouraging costly and timeconsuming legal suits but nothing worked the boston gato went his lonely way thundering booker t washington must be destroyed worse he followed washington from city to city in an unsuccessful attempt to question him about his program of accommodation at this juncture washington made an extraordinray blunder by accepting an invitation to speak at bostons columbus avenue ame zion church when he rose to speak on july the trotteriles were ready several of trotters supporters stationed at strategic points in the audience leaped to their feet and heckled washington trotter himself posed several carefully phrased questions asking in view of the fact that you are understood to be unwilling to insist upon the negro having his every right lxth civil and political would it not be a calamity at this juncture to make you our leader is the rope and the torch all the race is to get under your leadership as the heckling continued the audience became unmanageable and police were called to restore order when washington resumed his speech he unwisely told an equivocal anecdote about a balky mule and the church heaved with hisses shouts and screams in the confusion someone threw a batch of red pepper and the crowd panicked men and women trampling each other in a dash for the nearest exits when order was restored trotter and several of his aides were arrested trotter later served a day sentence at the charles street jail news reports of the boston riot startled americawhich was one can snppose trotters objective it had not been possible up to that point to get full coverage of the antiwashington viewpoint having selected washington as the negro leader the white power structure had carefully protected him from the crossfire of black dissidents but it was impossible to suppress the boston riot and word went out that some black people were displeased with their leader by organizing the boston riot trotter moved the seething ideological dispute in the black community to a new level he also created an act which made men stimd up and take sides either for or against booker t washington in the wake of this event w e b du bois abandoned his scholarly detachment and came down hard on the side of the radicals while have not always agreed with mr trotters methods du bois wrote a friend have had the greatest admiration for his singleheartcd earnestness and devotion to a great cause and i am the more minded to express this respect publicly when i see him the object of petty persecution and dishonest attack with trotter and du bois in the forefront the black radicals rallied and organized an antiwashington front on july twentynine black professionals met near niagara falls and inaugurated the niagara movement which marked the beginning of tlie modern protest movement in a larger group met at harpers ferry the site of john browns assault on the slave system and issued an address to the nation this address largely written by trotter and du bois raised issues which are still on the agenda of the commonwealth in detail our demands are clear and unequivocal first we would vote with the right to vote goes everything freedom manhood the honor of your wives the chastity of your daughters the right to work and the chance to rise and let no man listen to those who deny this we want full manhood suffrage and we want it now henceforth and forever second we want discrimination in public accommodations to cease separation in railway and street cars based simply on race and color is unamerican undemocratic and silly we protest against all such discrimination third we claim the right of freemen to walk talk and be with them that wish to be with us no man has a right to choose another man s friends and to attempt to do so is an impudent interference with the most fundamental human privilege fourth we want the laws enforced against rich as well as poor against capitalist as well as laborer against white as well as black we are not more lawless than the white race we are more often arrested convicted and mobbed we want justice even for criminals and outlaws we want the constitution of the country enforced we want congress to take charge of congressional elections we want the fourteenth amendment carried out to the letter and ever state disfranchised which attempts to disfranchise its rightful oters we want the fifteenth amendment enforced and no state allowed to base its franchise simply on color the failure of the republican party in congress at the session just closed to redeem its pledge of with reference to suffrage conditions at the south seems a plain deliberate and premeditated breach of promise and stamps that party as guilty of obtaining votes under false pretense fifth we want our children educated the school svstem in the country districts of the south is a disgrace and in few towns and cities are the negro schools what they ought to be we want the national government to step in and wipe out illiteracy in the south either the united states will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the united states and when we call for education we mean real education we believe in work we ourselves are workers but work is not necessarily education education is the development of power and ideal we want our children trained as intelligent human beings should be and we will fight for all time against any proposal to educate black boys and girls simply as servants and underlings or simply for the use of other people they have a right to know to think to aspire these are some of the chief things which we want how shall we get them by voting where we may vote by persistent unceasing agitation by hammering at the truth by sacrifice and work in a pioneering effort to give thrust to these words trotter and du bois put together an naacptype structure based on litigation education research from the beginning this organization was hampered by its narrow base it was composed primarily of black intellectuals and by internal dissension neither trotter nor du bois was an organization man and the presence of both in a single organization made strife inevitable trotter finally withdrew from the group and established his own organization the national equal rights league at that point trotter and du bois disagreed on several issues trotter placed more stress on independent black political action he also championed racially autonomous organizations when in the dwindling niagara militants and white liberals organized the national association for the advancement of colored people trotter tnie to his principles refused to join in his view the naacp was too little too late and too white trotters refusal to link up with naacp forces marked the fundamental turning point in his life from that point onward he was overshadowed by du bois and naacporiented leaders but for all that he remained a force to be reckoned with as the leader of the national equal rights league he continued to denounce compromisers of the left and the right on one celebrated occasion he stormed into the white house and denounced woodrow wilson who was segregating toilets and office facilities in washington d c according to participants the harvardtrained black rebel and the former president of princeton had an acrimonious jawtojaw confrontation trotter opened a new front during world war i by linking the afroamericans struggle with the cause of the colonized peoples of africa and asia when the government refused to give him a passport to attend the paris peace conference he disguised himself as a cook and sailed on a secondclass steamer in paris he peppered the delegates with pleas and admonitions the conferees turned a deaf ear to these pleas and wrote a forwhitesonly peace treaty returning to america trotter redoubled his eeorts in the field of agitation in and he led delegations to the white house the boston reformer experimented with direct action techniques by leading picket lines and demonstrations against the movie the birth of a nation in his paper he defended the scottsboro boys and new deal economic policies he also continued to press his favorite project crispiis attiicks day in a wiser world trotters story would have had a happier ending but history is tricky it does not always reward the first pioneer nor does it always remember sometimes as in the case of trotter history pushes a valiant man into the briar bush of the new in order to prepare the way for a successor who has fewer thistles to contend with and reaps a larger immediate return did trotter perceive this did he think of these things as the world turned from him and as others reaped the plaudits of the crowd no one knows he was not a whining man he asked no quarter and gave none until the end he walked his lonely way raising alarums and jousting with enemies real and imagined toward the end he was it seems a trifle disoriented and disheartened but he brightened up appreciably on his sixtysecond birthdayapril that night after dinner he took a stroll as was his wont on the roof of his boston boarding house before dawn he walked again on the roof and toppled to his death however he came to his end whether by accident or suicide trotters life was a parable of sacrifice and selflessness in the service of a cause which has gained more from great failures than from petty triumphs was trotter then a failure some men said so without realizing that there are magnificent failures greater than anything the world calls success no man fails who chooses failure when what the world calls success can only be had at the price of manhood no man fails who falls in the front ranks of battle facing the enemy in the end it might be said of trotter that he was a dialogue history carried on with itself in him and through him history clarified itself and moved to another level and men who never heard trotters name are his debtors and his disciples b arbara m watson knows the importance of keeping ones cool during the last year she has had to quell largescale bureaucratic infighting prepare a government budget and cope with frantic american visitors stranded in the middle east during the arabisraeli conflict as head of the u s state departments largest division one which washington diplomats fondly call the crisis bureau barara watson is acting administrator of the bureau of security and consular affairs and presently is the highestranking woman in the state department appointed to her job in april by president johnson miss watsons first step was to dispel sca inneroffice controversy caused in part by strongminded passport chief miss frances

barbara watson was sure of what she wanted to do like her father james s watson the first negro ever elected judge in new york city and her brother james l now a u s cinstoms judge she would enter law but disappointment followed law school wasnt exactly dull she remembers but it was dry undaunted miss watson decided she needed something challenging different and stimulating and set out to find it despite the hurdles she knew she would face as a negro woman the year was and as far as advertising was concerned photographic models had to be white but barbara decided it was time the agencies recognized the existence and needs of the negro market and so started a modeling agency to recruit attractive negro girls for firstrate advertisements it wasnt easy but in ten years she built up a flourishing business with two offices in new york and a modeling charm school suddenly however barbara decided to switch gears and drop the business there was no more challenge to it she explains after an extended vacation she went back to finish her law training ambitious barbara graduated third in her class at new york law school and was appointed attorney for the city of new york in mayor robert wagner named her executive director of the new york commission to the united nations fielding the problems that flared up between un delegates and the city proved to be a task requiring tact and diplomacy but she handled the job so well that two years later she receied a call from the state department asking her to fly to washington for a talk the talk was a preliminary to an eventual interview with dean rusk and it led to her presidential appointment to sca barbara took tlie job she says because i viewed it as a challenge not only for me personally but for my race and my sex im

modem jazz in consonance with its paradoxical history it was not commissioned by an american but by rolf lieberman director of the state opera at hamburg germany on its first performance in hamburg in october it was hailed as the most important opera written since alban bergs wosseck years before a subsequent performance by the hamburg company at the new metropolitan opera house in new york city during the summer of was disdainfully received later that same year a production by the san francisco opera company restored its reputation as a significant work of impressive dramatic impact most recently and surprisingly it was chosen as the single work to climax the centennial celebration at the university of illinois being given its third production in the world this spring by that traditionally staid academic institution that time the response was mixed much of the controversy surrounding the opera is rooted in the libretto which was written by schuller in conjunction with music that is eerily atonal and injected with jazzlike statements originally schuller had hoped to base his opera on ralph ellisons novel invisible mcin but whn be was unable to obtain the rights to do so he decided on a free adaptation of franz kafkas the trial a twentiethcentury literary classic steeped in symbolism and broadly interpreted as a prediction of the rise of hitler terrorism in europe reshaping the basic motive to fit within a modern american setting schuller chose a negro student as his central figure a young man named carter jones who merely wants to do well in a society where he believes he has certain human rights in the beginning carter jones is threatened by a group of strange white men representing forces within the society beyond his control he is never informed of any offense he has committed but is constantly forced to defend himself though he seeks help from individuals symbolic of basic institutions within the societytlie courts influential people the underworld and the churchhe finds no way out of his dilemma for no apparent reason he is fired from his job at a drug store evicted from his apartment accused of raping a white woman and eventually pursued through the streets to his death out of my experience with so many negroes particularly musicians i have seen both the mar clous and the horrible in their lix es explains schuller a selftaught composer who studied the techniques of opera during the years he spent as a french horn player in the metropolitan opera orchestra a high school dropout who is now president of the new england conservatory of music schuller asserts the daily confrontations all negroes must endure seem kafkaesque to methough whites find it difficult to understand what i mean by that when this proposal to do a jazz opera was first presented to me knew that if i was to use jazz at all the negro had to be involved though this is not a jazz opera in the complete sense of the word i did not want to do what the american musical theater has doneto borrow and steal from jazz without gin ing credit to its origins i n previous centuries the fine arts were the special province of the noble class and the church and state which it controlled today in the commercial arena of modern america the mantle of sponsorship has been assumed by other institutions most notably the universities drawing upon their vast store of resources they ha e been able to present to the public significant works that otherwise might have gone neglected noteworthy in this sense is the production of gunther schullers the visitation by the university of illinois it required a symphony orchestra of pieces supplemented by a jazz ensemble of seven pieces the lighting was intricate the footlong set complex and it called for a cast of more than persons professional opera companies might have shunned it on the grounds of epcnse aloneand then there was the added element of its controversial theme it was chosen because it had an ethical message related to our times says ludwig zirner head of the schools opera group and tlie man most responsible for its selection students worked with four negro professional singers who were employed for lead roles through a grant from the illinois arts council they were simon estes veteran of the hamburg production and winner of the tchaikovsky vocal competition in moscow eugene holmes of the new york city opera company herbert scottgibson alumnus of the illinois opera group and claudia lindsay who had sung with the metropolitan opera national company presentation of the opera was a matter of expressing what might be an unpleasant truth says zimer but this is the sort of creative role a unix ersity should play t enycarold sandra laing slipped unnoticed into the school cloakroom she made sure she was alone then picked up a can of white scouring powder and hastily sprinkled her face arms and hands remembering the teasing she had just endured in he schoolyard during recess she began scrubbing agorously trying to wash oft the natural brown color of her skin sandras efforts were prompted by a strange fact she had been born with dark skin african features and kinky hair into a south african family that was officially classified as white her troubles began two years ago when school officials in the transvaal town of piet retief said she could no longer attend the white primary school thev said that sandra was now m considered colored and therefore not entitled to mix with whites that was sandras formal introduction to the rigid apartheid segregation policy of her native land south african geneticists didnt look to the woodpile to explain sandras appearance they said a dormant throwback gene among the six colordetermining genes was responsible for the oddity of sandras hue racist pseudoscience has e cn more tragic effects in sandras situation than it has on the lies of other south africansblack white or colored when school officials expelled her two years ago they were acting under the population register act called the stud book statute once she was reclassified as colored they knew it would be illegal for sandra to attend the allwhite piet retief boarding school this reclassification also denied her access to all places and institutions used by white people and if the letter of the law were followed it made it illegal for her to live with her familyexcept as a servant even though sandra had been daily maligned and humiliated ill school her parents were not relieved when she was dismissed rather than accept offers for her to live with sympathetic africans in neighboring swaziland or with a nonracist family in england her father declared as far as my daughter is concerned i feel that south africa comes first right or wrong thus sandras parents chose to keep her under the thumb of their nations racist laws and populace sandras parents hae never told her exactly why she is treated the way she is as a result she acted out fantasy rather than face the bitter truth until recently she dutifully got up in time for school every morning since her dismissal in march of dressed herself in her school uniform then sat around the house and waited trying not to believe what was happening to her meanwhile her parents were using their saings they run two small trading stores in a futile fight against the stud book act which divides the south african population into whites africans coloreds mixed descent and asians with various subgroups the law wouldnt bend but the publicity of sandras case and other anomalies forced the govcrnment to pass an amendment ruling that if both parents are classified as white their children must also be classified as white so for sandra it was back into the white race this time as a cardcarrying member after missing two years of school her father had attempted to tutor her in the meantime says mrs laing she was now legally permitted back into white schools out of the fire and back into the frying pan thats what it all amounted to because it had been sandras appearance not her egfl classification that had aroused the bigotry of white parents two years before and thev still didnt want their children in school with a dark child xo matter what the statute books ruled sandra was still a kaffir to them businessman with four children in the piet retief school voiced white sentiment sandra laing will get hell if she returns to the school aware of the sentiment school officials once again slammed the door on sandra when she showed up for classes nd one white school after another turned her down perhaps a catholic coin ent might accept sandra her parents thought perhaps nuns would be more sympathetic but convent schools also turned sandra away the mother superior of a convent explained if i could hae had my way i would have admitted the little girl but we depend on public goodwill and as i see it we would onlv hac trouble if we admitted her we have to consider the feelings of our parents and children the laings hopes were lifted a bit when the transvaal department of education actuallv ordered the piet retief school to admit sandra but there was more heartbreak when school board members refused to act and claimed she would never be happy in the dormitory and it is not our duty to make her happy that is the responsibility of her parents the laings accepted this and tried still another loophole sandra would not stay in a dormitory they promised but with a pri ate family instead they went from house to hoiise looking for a white family it is illegal in south africa for a child legally white to live with a nonwhite family that would take sandra in they looked in vain whether because of fear or because of bigotry nobody wanted sandra laing mrs laing beliees that sandra doesnt understand what is happening to her little girl docs not understand why because she is so dark parents object to her mixing with their children at school how could she understandhav ing been brought up quite naturally as a white child in a white family she was sud denly and unexpectedly classified as belonging to a different racial group our child remained colored until this new law was brought in so now we are back where we started but not quite for public prejudice proved to be even more formidable than official prejudice nd sandra whose father be lie es she was brought up naturally as a white child watched her parents spend two years of time and money in an effort to get their government and compatriots to say that their brown daughter is not the color nature made her after the sheepmoor schoola public school near piet retief rejected sandra wath the excuse that the childrenany children would torment the child and make her life a misery mr laing felt stalemated and he despaired if the parents feel this way about sandra what humiliation and misery would face my little girl at that school but she must go to school and she is white so she must go to a white school a few months ago it was reported that a white school had accepted sandra the name of the school is secret how ever so that sandra can slip in and out quietlythrough the back door meanwhile sandras father has turned down an english woman who wtote to the little girl will you come and live in england with us we would look after vou and send you to school and protect you from all the cruel stupidity which is happening to vou now sandras brother leon disagrees with his fathers stand e ery day i think about her i love her very much and i cannot understand everything she was not always happy at the piet retief schoolthe children teased her a lot she should be sent to swaziland or overseas it breaks my heart to say this but in the long run it would be best for her the case of sandra laing is still another illustration of the extent to which racial attitudes have gripped white south africans so much so that even officialdom is powerless against it perhaps as the statecontrolled south african broadcasting corp has commented about the case sandra laing is entitled to companionship and a place in society this is the birthright of any person anywhere but sandra just years old remains a nonperson in her homeland t he patient just out of surgerv and still under anesthesia was a very special person joe louis former heavyweight champion of the world thus the hospitals intensive care room was ali e with the highkey efficiency of medical specialists making sure that all was going well nurses checked temperature and breathing rate and watched a blood pressure machine an electronic sensor flashed the champions heart beat in green blips on a radartype screen and a doctor monitored a device that spewed out tapes with the heart rate printed in squiggly lines it was perhaps normal postoperative routine but what seemed to make cerything just as special as the famous patient was that every hand that busied itself with his healing was a black hand and the hospital was one that black peoidle had gotten themsck es together to build and to run the hospital is kirwood general a bed facility very near detroits stillblackened corner of dexter and west davison where the burnedout hawkins haberdashery and red satin restaurant remind of last years riots look out of this window here says kirwoods administrator reginald p ayala who used to be on the harlem globetrotters team i stood here last year and saw the neighborhood in flames they burned almost every store down the street there but they didnt come this far they didnt try to set this hospital on fire perhaps they knew that kirwood is well black_power of a dilferent kind t what ayala is talking about is how at kirwood young and highlytrained black specialists in many medical fields have weighed racial pride against increased opportunities at big and prestigious hospitals and hac opted to take charge of an our operation and run it so efficiently that it has received nothing but praise so impressed was an inspection team from the joint commission on the accreditation of hospitals that kirwood was never required to sere a customary oneyear probation period it was awarded immediate maximum accreditationthree years as for community acceptance the hospitals expected firstyear occupancy of per cent shot above per cent within months after the doors of kirwoods new building were opened early last year for years operations had been in three old mansions on detroits east side now some s persons share a weekly payroll and kirwood has doctors on its staff expansion plans are already underway within two years says rick ayala well have added a new wing boosted capacity to beds and built up our staff to about doctors and employees well be pouring around a week of payroll money into the community and we ll be a pretty good size operaation then but well still keep kirwood as what one of the patients told me the other day a mighty good place to get well t he new kirwood general hospital is the brainchild of dr guy o saulsberry a softspoken general practitioner with lots of uptodate ideas i sensed the trend some years ago he says i knew that kirwood couldnt survive if we didnt move away from the old small priate negro hospital type of operation id begun back in wed have to move toward the type of institution that could attract the young and highlytrained negro doctors who were coming out of school fellows who would want pleasant surroundings and modern eciuipment and the very finest of research facilities if we couldnt offer all these things wed lose those fellows and i knew it dr saulsberry set about trying to build the kind of comprehensive medical center he visualized he had already given up personal control of kirwood in to tnistces of a nonprofit corporation now he began scouting detroit for building sites began putting out feelers to the citys hospital estahlishment and began putting aside large chunks of his own money just in case we had to fight everything through and few people know all about the fight that saulsberry had savs dr robert c bennett a kirwood staffer who is joe louiss personal physician without going into some rather unpleasant details just say that there were certain people who didnt seem too enthusiastic about seeing this hospital built the hint is that the establishment threw up more than a few blockades worn down by years of effort dr saulsberry was just about ready to throw up my hands and take off for africa or some place when dr bennett put him in touch with joe louiss wife martha a los angeles attorney who had assistrl teamsters union president james c hoffa with legal work she was our angel dr saulsberry says within weeks she had taken our plans to teamsters officials and won approval of a millionplus loan with the monev which came from the teamsters chicagobased central states southeast and soutliweast area pension fund kirwood took over a large former recreation center rebuilt its interior and added a new wing patients rooms and every department were equipped with the most modern facilities on the market and the first patient was admitted months ago so far kirwood has not received a single penny of federal funds and the only large donationhas come from the d m ferry jr trustee corporation ferry seeds of detroit daytoday support is given by a womens auxiliary social clubs such as the rinky dinks individuals and by doctors and employes of the hospital itself dr saulsberry the grand old man of kirwood still sees a few patients in his small clinic at the hospital but almost every day he can he seen walking down the long corridors and through the lobby smiling at patients and workers and seeming real jroud of what he now finally sees ik you tak a plane from

cathedral is called st nicholas headquarters of the member russian orthodox church of america and the symbol of change there is the pastor of its spanishspeaking parish father vladimir owens who claims to be the first and only black russian orthodox priest in this country the yearold priest born robert owens in birmingham ala and reared by his steelworker father in cleveland has served at st nicholas since when the church first fashioned its spanish liturgy unique among the offerings of new york citys russian orthodox churches the spanish liturgy at st nicholas was designed to attract the predominately puerto rican upper east side community among father vladimirs working roles is that of interpreter for archbishop jonathan newly appointed head of the american church the black priests grasp of english spanish russian german french and hebrew is a great help to the archbishop who only six months in this country is still learning english r aised as a roman catholic father vlaclimir became interested in the russian orthodox reliiion while studying the russian language at kent state university in kent ohio although he was a psychology major he joined the schools russian club in which he explains everyone else was orthodox so i became interested in the russian church his interest led him to the orthodox chaplain on campus who encouraged him to attend a russian church in cleveland during these college years father vdadimir who sas he always wanted to be a priest recalls he began to cpiestion the catholic doctrines of papal infallibility and immaculate conception neither of which is accepted in russian orthodoxy two years later he decided to conv ert in fresh out of college he entered the holy trinity russian orthodox seminary in jordanville n y where only russian is spoken in fie years he emerged an ordained priest with a slight russian accent permeating his english father vladimir w hose brother is a imiversity student and w hose father still works for the u s steel company says my family is very pleased at my becoming a priest the knew i abvays wanted to be a priest and they didnt mind a s interpreter for archbishop jonathan father vladimir travels to parishes throughout the country where many church members are shocked to see him the black priest says that during a recent trip through pennsylvania ohio and michigan some parishioners claimed to have heard about him but had nevertheless conceded we didnt believe what we had heard one priest father vladimir sas to prove i was really there had me preach a sermon in his church while he found midwesterners usually nice father vladimir acknowledged some overtlv hostile reactions one incident occurred while he conducted a funeral when the people saw me he recalls some of them walked out others made remarks the young priest emphasizes that such events do not surprise him i realize exeryone doesnt like me he concedes things do happen on occasion but on the whole people are nice i knew from the beginning that some people would resent me during a moscow trip in the priest explains the reaction of the russians was of great curiosity but it was friendly curiosity hundreds of people asked for my blessing the faith of the russian people he said was much stronger than that among most americans faced with the claim that the russian orthodox church accepts the domination of the soviet government father vladimir sax s he had met many priests in the soviet union and nexer noticed any interest in politics on their part the same is true of st nicholas he insists i consider myself the farthest thing from a communist and loyal to the united states although he has not been inx olx ed in the civil_rights movement father madimir recently made his first trip to harlem and after a short stay promised to spend more time in the black community the character of his home church is changing most of the xvhite parishioners have mox ed from manhattan to the remote comers of queens county and to the suburbs some still attend serx ices regularly but they come in the greatest numbers only on the important holy days well equipped for nexv yorks language melange the priest speaks german french and hebrexv in addition to english spanish and russian he also understands polish and hungarian because he is an unmarried priest father vmadimir can aspire to a bishopric in his church he hopes that as he advances in the hierarchy more black people xvill be attracted to russian orthodoxy the orthodox churchs strong adherence to tradition beauty and simplicity of its ritual hax e a strong appeal to religious people he suggests and black people are strongly religious i n this clay of social revolution bad hair is good hair and black skin is beautiful but fat is ugly and

industrious enough to work her way tlirough college remov ing rings of dirt from around bathtubs who is clever enough to keep a ring of gold from around her third finger left hand would surely have enough fortitude to get rid of the ring of blubber surrounding her middle and why dont because i lack motivation because i have no food resisting cualities because basically i hate myself the years between sweet sixteen and size are strewn with abortiv e attempts to reduce when i was five pounds overweight friends said i was wellformed at ten pounds over they shifted their evaluation to pleasingly plump at the iound mark they asked arent you getting a little heav y now at pounds over they dont say anything but rumor has it that the mound i laughingly refer to as baby fat is years old or six months gone like millions of adult americans i am munching my way tovvard hard core obesity but while others escalate their war on fat i gorge in my condition if the bariatricians obesity docs

seasoned heavy with starches and sweets and heaped high on the plate salads get short shrift and herbs play a larger role in the mystic life of the ghetto than in ghetto diets health stores that dare display carrot juice and yogurt die aborning there was no such thing as a soul food diet but there is sec below now the more educated a black becomes says my doctor the more aware he is of the dangers of obesity this is especially true of professional people and white collar workers whose appearance is important to their jobs except for louie armstrong who must have his laxative every night springtime sassafras tea and yearround epsoms salts are slowly losing out to appetite depressants and lowcalorie foods chicken frying honors have been taken over by a white kentucky colonel and a

meals at home they were admonished and let your stomachs rest to which their wives sighed a hearty amen gluttony is the biggest villain in the obesity woodpile but it is the last blamed and least likely to be forsaken no matter how many fat white rats keel over and die reducing is something that begins tomorrow with somebody else when an insurance company penalized me for high blood pressure i thought seriously about dieting for the first time when mini dresses caused a sitdown problem i asked as the new york city health department clinic suggests am i important to myself the answer was no not enough to pass up a chocolate fudge sundae or buttermilk biscuits swimming in butter so i put on a comfortable shift had a modesty skirt placed in front of my desk and as an added precaution tacked a dont feed the editor sign o er my office door pills i have triedand gained two pounds i am afraid of injections i am too hardheaded for hypnosis no medic is big enough to meddle with my thyroid or persuasive enough to bring me to the gutlevtl of bypass intestine removal surgery neither can i afiford nor would i likely be accepted by a calorie aday fat farm even if its gymnasium has walltowall carpeting and a swimming pool filled with fatfree milk the only time i ever lost weight was when i had pneumonia then it began to happen with more malice than human insight my boss assigned me to do a story on reducing research alas would force me to do what hypertension and exposed thighs could not in a last ditch attempt to stave off the inevitable i took the three tests for obesity one look in the mirror confinned the premise that excess fat hastens aging and should have eliminated the other two tests but food resistance like old soldiers and layers of adipose is slow to fade away lying on my back i placed a yardstick vertically over my body it touched neither the xijphoid stemi or the other end just balanced precariously over an unsinkable abdomen pinching myself to tell not if i were but how long i would be alive the rubber tire above my girdle and between my fingers was five times the thickness of the silly little millimeter it should have been the only question now was how to reduce not when reading bud wilkinsons physical fitness routine convinced me that that was not the way i wanted to go standing in the center of a chair swinging one leg over the side is to court disaster the wall pushwhile facing the wallis a more direct form of selfdestruction years of driving to the corner drugstore and riding highrise elevators to the second floor have made me too lazy for any form of calisthenics so whats left stuff it inside a girdle wash it away with a liquid diet starve it to death in a hospital wlien all is said and tried the only way to obtain and maintain that alldesirable state of shapely weightlessness is to eat less food dieting then would be my salvation a sensible balanced diet that would restore the girlish figure i never had no more eating to keep otliers company to get rid of leftovers just because tliey are tliere no more feeding both a cold and a fever or indulging in that delightful contest of coming out even with crackers jelly and cheese no more gullying down food while simultaneously reading a newspaper watching tv and carring on a telephone conversation no more snacking just three square meals a daynot a night i cleared the frig of ice cream and filled the pantry with lowcalorie cans dietdrink bottles and sugar substitutes then i began to shop for a juice blender an ounce scale calipers and a computer to record the calories the kinds of diets are endless i eliminated dangerous crash programs and dismissed the exotic zen buddhist macrobiotic ritual along with such irrelevant diets as those beamed at the drinking man and the wise woman in the process i gleaned a number of salient facts every fat person should knowand found a few discrepancies more scientific than those embarrassing obesity tests is the mathe matical method of determining the degree of damage and the number of calories per day rcfiuircd to obtain and maintain the ideal weight a bigboned deskbound lady like myself who is not so young and not so tall should weigh pounds fifteen times my ideal weight or calories per day are all i need to hold the line from to less calories per day should help me find it if your math is bad ask your friendly doctor for a weight chart in fact dont begin any serious diet without consulting him a candy bar binge i read with sorrow can take oe weight and it can be nutritiously disastrous perhaps the greatest area of disparity is in the counting whole wheat bread varies from to calories ice cream from to and half a grapefruit from to of course there is a lot of haggling over size of servings which probably makes up some of the differences but we cowards take the low count anyway by the time i look up each item in my several calorie counters record and adjust the figures my plate of food is hostile cold my interest in it diminishedprobably as intended on the other hand by using lowcalorie ice milk and diet fudge topping save so many points that i can aeord to eat twice as much and with nuts the number and time of meals is another point of diflerence which ranges from three squares to allday snacking and from emphasis on a heavy breakfast to a big leisurely dinner most experts claim that blaming a glandular condition or an underactive thyroid for obesity is just an excuse recent discoveries however may prove the blame well xlaced excuses and criticisms will not alter the fact that i am fat but my case is not hopeless by dieting duke ellington lost pounds satchmo and godfrey cambridge shed playboy hugh hefner who sueered in reverse put on pounds by kicking the rabbit food habit and never lost a bunny all of these men i suspect had good motivation now so have i perhaps my children would be ashamed of meif had children maybe rotundity would interfere with my love lifeif i had a lover surely my job is not in jeopardyif i still have a job but for my own sake i want to reduce now i have the will power with my good hair and beautiful color i siwll overcome while

audrey is my neighbor audrey is a nurse who should know better i told her about my diet and we sat down over glasses of skim milkand warm chocolate caketo talk it over today six pounds heavier i am not discouraged at less calories a week it will take days of sheer torture and determination to undo the damage in the meantime i will wear clothes two sizes too large and friends will grudgingly say my how youve lost w hen amos wells jr dug the harmonica in the downtown pawnshop window he knew that if it were his he could do something with it but the harmonica was priced at two dollars and the black youngster from the south side of chieago didnt have that kind of money nor was it easy to come by when offered a job on a soda pop truck he jumped at the chance to earn his as it was known among the cats in his neighborhood harp even though it would mean playing hookey from school at the end of the week he received wages totaling one dollar and fifty cents young amos however could not resist going back to the pawnshop he offered the pawnbroker all the money he had for the haq but it wasnt enough insisting upon the full price the man walked away leaving the harp lying on the counter i just had to have that harp the boy told the judge at his trial perhaps the judge saw some truth in his statement for the action he took cannot be found in the books on mans law the judge requested that the defendant demonstrate his technique with the stolen item and when the little bitty musician did his thing which was the humblest of beginnings the judge gave the pawnbroker cents and hollered case dismissed that says junior wells happened when he was or years old he got his harp the pawnbrokers burden was eased and a bluesman was bom this yearold man who blows a harp and sings the blues swears that easing peoples burdens in such a manner is his lifcy and early this year he recorded an album called ifs my life baby the blues says junior just gets next to me gets in my body and soul knocks me out kills me doubtless the blues is his passion if i couldnt sing the blues i wouldnt be he says but the world might as well know that junior wells is very much here notwithstanding that the blues he speaks of have probably sent him to hell and back any number of times junior is what is called in the trade and among those in the know a city bluesman the city bluesmen as outlined in charles keils classic urban blues play an expressive male role within urban lowerclass ie economic culture the city bluesmen are of course descendents of the country bluesmen charley patton son house and robert johnson among others even muddy waters who became one of the baddest of the city bluesmen started his career in the country singing the style that the folks down home responded to muddy along with such city favorites as j b lenoir howlin wolf jimmy reed and the late little walter came from mississippi junior wells true to tradition has deep southern roots he was bom in memphis tenn grew up on a farm in arkansas and hadnt long come to chicago when he came upon the harp he had to have those roots burn through juniors oftentimes harsh gravellike baritone with all the ease of birds flying and it is not imaginable that he would sing those roots out of his soul if he sings into the next century his coining to chicago was for the puqose of joining his mother shortly after she and his father separated when asked if his dad was a singer junior laughed yeah hes a singer all right he sings in that field down there in arkansasbut hes a helluv a dancer someone asked if his father was retired and junior answered hows he gonna retire when he retire charlie gonna put some dirt in his face how many negro farmers you know done retired and with that question junior assures all that be is familiar with fore him he sits at the bar for a spell then mingles with the crowd always sipping grandad talking about the life they shareand never more than a moment away from laughing or inspiring the same in others singing signifying or just talking that talk and walking that walk juniors style has to be called easy im gon sing them damn blues and you better dig it he says in a voice youd like to perfect if you were a stickup man taking the bandstand he sings them damn blues soulful and sacred and nothing will ever be blacker or more beautiful to the people who never stop asking for more watching junior wells perform at peppers is truly to watch a man at work in the richest sense of the phrase for it is not in the usual sense a moneymaking proposition owner johnny pepper cant pay junior the wages he makes when on the road taking his raw action where the moneys atthe white communitybut gigging at peppers is at least more rewarding these days than the eight or ten dollars a night junior used to pull dovvm for working a south side club i thought that was really something in those days he allows oc the sociologythe way it isof the people out of whose lives comes the music he makes perhaps it is a new generation of blacks who groove to such popular hits of his as lp in heah but when folks from the old country hear junior wells they know that the style that turned them on is yet helping people rejoice on earth which is just possibly what howlin wolf was getting at when he said i sing for the people junior also sings for the people when hes at home but these days liis time is divided between home and the roadtaking his blues to coffee houses college campuses and wherever the larger society will patronize the art they have come more and more to recognize but home remains chicagos south side and specifically peppers lounge on east rd street only a few blocks from the notquiteyearold but already legendary wall of hespect for blues lovers peppers is a kind of mecca the place where all the blues greats have passed through and left their mark and not the least of that mark is personified by peppers patronage as hip an audience as any performer anywhere ever faced it is not their style to always applaud when the artist gets next to them tending to express their approx al more by moving their whole bodies but theyll surely let him know if he comes up short the place rocks when junior is in town he struts into peppers like the master he is his processor do sitting high and pretty for the sisters to dig imitating nobody from the other side of towm but rather only the bluesmen whove gone be casionally on an awayfromhome one nighter he now earns as much as other than his cadillac car however there is little that would distinguish junior from the folks who come to hear him the lithe black cat favors those brightcolored tightfitting suits that are about as far away from those drab drooping zoot suits of years ago as is the black community itself question whether or not he has his thing together if you dare but when junior enters a neighborhood soul food joint with his entourage of brothers he orders ham hocks and jives the waitress with all the suave assurance that ever belonged to any cultural hero to be sure there have been for this spirited bluesman lean years since the time just into his teens he sneaked into the c t lounge on chicagos near south side bluesmen tampa red and johnny jones were holding forth johnny persuaded tampa to let the youngster join them but the owner promptly showed the underage junior the way to the door that didnt discourage him he simply set up his amplifier in front of the club and jammed on the cop on the beat chased him inside this time for good junior soon found himself part of a group working the c t friday saturday and sunday nights i used to make four dollars for three nights work he recalls he didnt believe it would make him rich however he found so much satisfactionto borrow from the late otis reddingsinging the blues that he quit dusable high school after his first day because he couldnt sing the blues all night and go to school the next morning in discussing the early years junior never a prize student doesnt speak of the fascination of gaining knowledge from books i was bad as hell into everything i played hookey from school i stole and i girl chased he laughs a boyish look of mischief lighting uj his mature face as he relives the past junior thinks youngsters of today should seek an education but he warns them that they cant learn cvervthing about life in a classroom i learned about life the hard way he says and there is the sense that he believes that the black youngsters digging him if they really listen might leam to better interpret lifes sorrows from the c t young junior moved to another local tdunge where he came to the attention of his spiritual father muddy waters muddys was a commonplace name to black chicagoans in the late s and early s be they blues lovers or just plain folks whose heritage could not be separated from the blues muddy and little walter stood junior on a crate one night so he could reach the mike and junior working his harp in boss fashion made in tips when little walter cut out from muddy to go it alone junior stepped right in singers of the blues know each other instinctively or so it appears to the layman for just as muddy easily recognized the strong talent of young wells so also can junior today tell you confidently a lot of people dont know it but james brown is a blues singer any man who repeats himself the way james brown does is a blues singer a simple definition perhaps but then the blues has been called simple music by those who perchance will never understand its importance as an art form art forms it cannot be denied must contain universality the blues with their lyrics about hearts tom with pain and that ages old trouble with the money changers are both historic and indicative of a universal experience moreover when the junior wells group took a recent state department tour of africa they discovered that the rhythms amid their bar blues were by no means foreign to the emotions of the brothers and sisters that side of the middle passage they got turned on behind the blues says junior but they were not alone turned on man the second i got off that plane and saw all them beautiful black folks i knew i was home exclaims the haq man the journey to africa he says was more exciting than anything hes ever experienced he gave his all in frica but on the other hand junior gave his all while touring europe two years ago as well in east berlin an audience of some came out to dig him go through his changes at a a m session on ordinary days junior cannot be awakened at that hour performing entertainingperhaps even more than but certainly along with the grandadis juniors shot cutting a single in a recording studio he evoked images of a man at rare peace in his work or to put it more succinctly and more in the idiom he cut uphad a natural ball his legs probably did not start vibrating before the music started but the naked eye could hardly differentiate now yall dig this watch me im gon work with it was the manner in which he prefaced the lyrics make your move in the right direetion make it known that you dig the action a little bit of soul ejappin a little hit of soid clappin get together and get your game up tight take your time throughout the song junior improised upon the lyrics written by his friend fit r man jack daniels with such james brownzy bits as momma dig me and good god w atch me and when junior wus satisfied that the cutits all soulwas in order and somebody in the studio suggested that he missed on just one little part lie retorted damn that little part thats whats gon make it sell all that correctness aint there thats what makes it funky it was cut that way funk intact it sold and its a measure of junior wells talent that he hadnt heard the music nor seen the lyrics before entering the recording studio that morning its all soul is a swinger fuel for the bugaloo or african twist or the one you learned last night and junior sings it with strong black joy but aint nothing like the slow blues he says yeah i just likes them slow blues nd among the slow gutbuekel blues if you dont dig them says chicago disc jockey pervis sjann youve got a hole in your soul junior sings with that oicc critic nat ilentoff accurately called imperious are hoodoo man blues i could cry ships on the ocean its so sad to be lonely and the recently recorded tribute to little walter when asked about the best in the blues business junior not surprisingly mentions muddy right away and ray charles still got good soul too got the damdest soul i ever saw does that mean that he thinks muddv waters and rav charles arc the best singers in the country the best the best singer mahalia jackson is the best singer in any country en erything she sings i feel it that according to junior is the supreme test music has to be put to can yon feel it he doesnt buy the western assumption that would make bachs and not junior wells sounds music to appreciate junior laughs scornfully when i was in the anny got drunk once and went to one of them concerts that symphony music will put a eat to sleep on the album its my life baby junior comes on in a oiec as sweet as tlie other is harsh were gonna try to do just a little bit of a little tune that that i think perhaps you might appreciate its the blues and you have to get the bines with a soullow an dirty liuli lets get with it this morning want to its a crazy little thing that goes like this its so sad to be lonesome and its too inconvenienced to be alone lord its so sad to be lonesome and its too inconvenienced to be alone lord you know it niakes a man feel so good when his baby comes back home it was recorded live at peppers and it is indeed junior at his best all cultures wrote lehoi jones are necessarily profound and experiencing this bliiesman who reflects the depths of sorrow and joy in black life is for black people to experience and appreciate ones culture nd one comes away believing no one can deny junior wells his dream of going just as far as can go w ith the blues t he world champion st louis cardinals were such an explosivehitting fireballing hardrunning team they won the nickname the gas house gang few teams have assembled a galaxy of stars to equal pepper martin dizzy and paul dean ducky medwick ripper collins leo durochcr and tex carleton the world champion cardinals didnt pick up a nickname as dynamic as gas house gang their batting leader from puerto rico orlando cha cha cepeda dubbed them el birdos a spanishenglish word of his invention but el birdos stormed through major league opposition with hitting pitching running and fielding at least the equal of that of the cardinal gang of old furthermore the galaxy of modern cardinal stars is not lily white like the constellation the gas house was a segregated outfit hut el birdos shine with nine dark stars four of them cepeda bob gibson lou brock and curt floodof the first magnitude el birdos may not have players all of the same feather but countering the old adage they flock together in spring training a coach called them the loosest team ive ever seen as they talked and joked with each other they were loose then but they had all been pretty tight during salary talks that winter the payroll of their world serieswinning lineup is unmatched in baseball history lou brock ilf curt flood cf roger maris rf orlando cepeda ib tim mccarver c mike shannon b julian javier b dal maxvill ss bob gibson p the total payroll for the starting nine of the el birdos is a hefty when bob gibson is the starting pitcherenough to make the surviving members of the old gas house gang wish they had come along in the day of integrated baseball it hasnt been easy for black ballplayers even super stars to get what they are worth the cards man with a golden arm and iron gut yearold bob hoot gibson is a case in point after his second world series recordsetting performance last year when he fanned allowed onlv three runs and hits in three world series ictoriessomething only a base ball immortal like christy mathewson was supposed to be able to dogibson wanted to be paid accordingly they keep mentioning me along with the great pitchers if im one of the top performers in my profession i should get that kind of money gibson announced as he bid for a salary former gas house gang star leo the lip durocher now managing the cubs said that if the cardinals didnt give their ace a contract they are crazy but gibson didnt get it gibson is a sensitive somewhat aloof mandownright surly on a day hes scheduled to pitch he refuses to fool people into believing that he is grinningly grateful for earning big money today he reminds them i had to sign for a bonus wliile lots of white guys who couldnt throw the way i could signed for gibson knows that he can never earn back the loss of a big bonus when sport magazine asked gibson what he thinks about the militant trend in the black freedom movement he answered its justified this crap has gone on for years and years in the past not enough people were willing to voice their opinions now the young black men are concerned theyre not afraid to speak out the older i am the more bitter i get about the whole darn thing curt flood the yearold top hitting and fielding center fielder in baseball agrees with gibson few of us black ballplayers really have time to be activelv militant we arent organized so we dont stand for any position on an issue but some of us support the militants i know i do but i can only speak for number number batted last season led center fielders in fielding for the fifth straight year and set a league record for consecutive errorless games by an outfielder flood banged up his shoulder pursuing a fly ball and missed games but still lashed out hits an accomplished portrait painter floods teammates call him rembrandt he paints three or four portraits ever two weeks and collects to for each one i began portrait painting just a little over a year ago as a hobby says flood although i studied commercial painting from to but now portrait painting is developing awfully fast for me right now im booked up for months of work i dont know what ill do with my art after i retire from baseball but i do know that ill continue in my missouriwide real estate business lou brock the yearold left fielder who has become baseballs thing of beauty with his blend of grace power speed intelligence and daring is undecided about his future im not sure what ill do when i stop playing its too early to say as far as managing or coaching goes whether you get into that aspect of the game depends on your contacts if the owner or manager likes a guy then the guy is likely to get a job if he wants one brock thinks black ballplayers could do more for the freedom movement than they have done but that its not fair to knock a guy as an uncle tom just because he cant be a militant he may want the same thing the movement wants were all in the movement but its hard on a person if people keep asking him what his people want when all a person playing ball all the time knows is what he reads in the newspapers everjone wants the same thingssecurity for his family and for his kids to go to school where they want to things like that orlando gepeda the burly most valuable player who gave el birdos their name conceals a sharp mind beneath his boyish charm and rhythmic zest for the game when gepeda played for the giants he had a bad knee the knee hurt me all the time he recalls but some people think that because we are latins because we did not have everything growing up we are not supposed to be hurt the peopie who disbelieecl cepeda were managers alvin dark and herman franks dark later apologized says cepeda but franks didnt believe me even after they operated on my knee cepeda told wtiter dickson teriy that he agreed with giant pitcher juan marichal who said latin american ballplayers are subjected to more bigotry than black north american ballplayers we come here but we have our own customs they baseball officials and the public dont understand latin people but whats worse most of the time they dont try but now cepeda is happy he pipes latin soul music into the cardinals locker room he leads cardinal cheers and invents slogans to inspire fans and players alike he eats pure honey from the hills of puerto rico to give me super strength el birdos top slugger truthfully obseres i am like good winethe older i get the better i get now perched on top of the national league again the spirited el birdos all show the winelike quality of their leading power hitter the nine black cardinals join other brothers in the national league the total is per cent of league players the giants are perennial bridesmaids but they will be lucky if they hang on to that role with national league competition as fierce as it is the great pitching staff of juan marichal mike mccormick gaylord perry and ray sadecki must average close to twenty victories per man even if willie mays improves on last year the giants must increase their double plays and decrease their errors to keep ahead of the cubs reds and pirates traditionally an erratic club the giants always find ways to drop the pennant they have ncer seemed a happy team jim ray hart has continued to produce runs at a superb rate for the san the cubs finally found some pitchers to complement their thunderous hitting attack with fergie jenkins bill hands rich nye ken holtzman and joe niekro the onetime doormats can match any team in starting pitchers potential but their relievers are ineffective one thing is for sure the cub defense wont give away cheap ninsit led the league in fielding last year randy hundley the gibraltar behind home plate caught more games than anyone in the majors last year and allowed only four passed balls with sweet lou johnson a bundle of hustle and clutch hits joining the team this year the cubs are sure of a top position again if ron santo and ernie banks repeat their good years if billy williams snaps back to his xplus batting form and if shaky adolfo phillips does at least as well as he did last year those ifs arent really very big ones so the pirates led the league in batting as usual hitting at a phenomenal pace points ahead of the world champion cardinals their infield led the league in double plays but their pitching was next to last and they could only win at a rate away from home so the biics came in sixth last year games off the lead they should move up at least one notch with the addition of righthanded ace jim bunning and it is hard to imagine them more than ten games off the pace this year but with at least a five team race it is hard to see bunning taking up enough slack to pull them into firstunless a mcbean fulfills his early season promise to mow domi the league if he does the pirates may fight the cards down to the wire bob veale the towering fireballer will whiff batters at his steady rate and steve blass appears to be the muchneeded fourth starter the pirates desperately sought if these four arms stay healthy this team is a contender but there is hardlv any starting or relieving talent behind them roy face the vearold righthander has lost a few prongs from his fork ball and needs all the help he can get juan pizarro might provide it in all other departments of the game the pirates are firstrate they have four outfielders of all star caliberroberto clemente baseballs finest player matty alou willie stargell and manny mota and maury wills heads a fine hitting infield donn clendenon however will have to hit and field better this vear if he wants to stay with the club for there are slugging rookies tring to break through to the parent roster in short if the team psychiatrist cures what ails the bucs they may put it all together and cop the pennant cincinnati is a puzzling club on paper they are the second finest club in the majors they were second to the giants in nl pitching second to the cubs in fielding but only fifth in club battingwhere they should be second or third their big problem is that their percentage on the road was versus at home this year alex johnson whom they got from the cards must come into his own and lee may must join him slugging tony perez should be able to come back with another fine year vada pinson and pete rose are bound to come up with another batch of gamewinning hits catches and throws but it is likely that the red pitchers will let in runs at just the wrong time and that red batters will make only a fine year by baseballs hurting angry young man richie allen can carry the phillies as high as fifth or sixth this year last year this super star missed games after slicing the nerves and muscles in his wrist in an accident with him the phillies had a good shot at second but this year allens hand isnt k per cent and unless the weather stays hot and his temper cool tlie phillies will be torn by dissension bill white was anemic at the plate last year its a sure bet hell be much more dangerous this year the same goes for john briggs and john callison cookie rojas the ersatile young cuban is off to a good start but tony gonzales who hit last season hasnt caught fire yet tony taylors fielding at third will make up for the fact that allen moved to left field but the philly pitching staff is likely to drop the team to the basement with the loss of tbvictim rico carty for one season the burden of taking over his run production falls on sandy valdespino recent addition sonny jackson must also perform well tommie aaron is back again and only his mental attitude can keep this burly slugger from fulfilling his promise he doesnt have to match brother hammering henry aaron who can hank is fourth in alltime grand slams hell be second in nl homers when the season is over hell be third or fourth in nl rbis and fourth in total bases come october and at the end of the season he will hold the braves all time lead in ten of the batting departmentsgames at bats runs hits doubles home runs total bases rbis extra base hits and slugging percentage on the nonexpansion major league teams onlv ted williams has dominated a team more and only stan musial and ty cobb equal aarons record henry aaron walks softly the braves will finish much higher than this if team officials examine their souls and learn how to win the respect of the players say several exbraves its risky to pick the mets to climb this far out of the cellar but rookie pitchers jerry koosman and nolan byan join last years rookie of the year tom seaver and that means the mets could easily pick up the x percentage points they need to reach eighth place a jackson will win more than he loses if he gets any kind of hitting support ed charles the poet at third is far better with the bat and glove than with the pen hes one of the most underrated players in the game tommie agee is fizzling again but if he can hit if ed kranepool cleon jones and ron swoboda hit and if the team catches the ballall big ifs the mets will rise this season the dodgers were the only team which played an exhibition game on the sunday after dr_king was murdered and everyone knows they didnt want to postpone their season opener in dr_kings memory whether this will affect team harmonv remains to be seen the team still cant hit but it should field better this year zoilo versalles will go well while the going is good and mudeat grant may surprise a lot of people but the dodgers only hope for the first division is to get last gasp performances out of don drysdale and bocky colavito and of course orlando cepedas cousin rookie luis alcaraz has royal baseball blood in him if a host of young pitchers comes through the bums can be boosted to around fourtli or fifth this is a team on the way up but theyre so young that military obligations will hamstring the team in this years race rusty staub is the youngest great hitter in the game and he is getting better the team was fourth in batting but last in pitching and fielding last year with don no hit wilson speedballing mike cuellar dave giusti and denny lemaster there is no reason for the astros to let in so many runs again ivan murrell will do a fine job if given a chance the same goes for the underplayed julio gotay at second if jim wynn hits a bundle again the team will soar denis menke and rookie hector torres should hold down shortstop pretty well and then theres joe morgan who should be an allstar soon rookie hal king has pushed top catcher john bateman into playing better with its surplus of hitting talent the astros should try to get two top relief pitchers before its too late this team is at least the leagues premier spoiler it will be more than that if its players in tlie service return like detroit the twins had no excuse last year so figure them to be on the wane dean chance is getting hit and jim kaats arm is a question mark roseboro will help even if he only hits and rookie of the year rod carew may hit even better this year jack hernandez should plug the holes at short handyman cesar tovar will do the job with baltimore and cleveland weak last year detroit had no reason to fumble the pennant so its hard to have confidence in tliem this year they may be more than paper tigers but too many key bengals injure themselves at the wrong time the infield didnt hit much last year mcauliffe and wert will do better this season and the aging eddie mathews and stormin norman cash can still swing rotund willie horton says hes healthy gates brown is being wasted by the detroiters in all fairness they should trade him of course pitching is the tiger hole cardearl wilson mickey lolich denny mclain and joe after baltimore won the flag in they fell to sixth the bosox are due for the same regrouping experience the determined jose santiago has kept the sox respectable by pitching over his head while sluggers like scott smith foy yaz jones and adair have taken a long time to start hitting the sox dont look like here is another team that could finish two spots higher or lower than this prediction with a new manager and new city the pressure may be too much for the young sluggers but reggie jackson looks too good to crumble and so do sal bando ramon webster and rick monday if anyone slips up floyd robinson is ready with liis lifetime average and the young veterans bert campaneris blue moon odom chuck dobson catfish hunter and jim nash should settle into stardom this year and perhaps danny cater will too besides developing the pitching staff the as must discipline their reckless defense t will take some doing for eddie the brat stanky to make up for his teams miserable start unless the whole team hits much better than it ever has before the chisox can only hope that disaster strikes the four clubs picked ahead of them the pitching staff probably wont top the league this year and slugger pete wards errors will offset some of his rbis sending the exciting hustler walt no neck williams to the minors was a disservice to the game tommy davis may help epstein cuts loose rookies del unser and frank coggins promise big things frank howard will continue to do his job so will paul casanova ken mcmullen should hit the pitching staff is shakv but talented the manager is green maybe it all wont fall together this year if it does put them ninth the angels were fifth last year only ofl the pace the three teams picked in front of them here will have to play up to their full potential to keep the angels this far back this is a lackluster club that performs well day in and day out there is not a big star on the club but the talent is evenly dispersed the pitchers will have to do at least as well this year if chuck hinton can hit it could be heaven for the angels t he story is probably as old as the oldest black grandfather now liv ing in these united states it is usually told about a chinese laundryman down south who innocently addressed one of his black clients as mr nigger the negro man chastised the chinese both orally and physicallystressing the fact that he wanted to be addressed properly from then on the laundrtnan did his homework the next time the man walked into the laundry the proprietor was ready good morning mr colored nigger gentleman sir he said tlie many speakers both black and white who have to address groups of black people today must feel very much like the chinese laundryman in the anecdote above because there is still so much confusion about how a black american wants to be addressed the decision can often be a ticklish one one negro speaker solved his problem and got his point across quite humorously when he said mr chaiitnan distinguished platform guests and my fellow afroamericans negro black colored soul brothers and sisters the rise of negro ost of the black americans living in the us today grew up during a period when negro was the accepted designation for those of african descent but few know how slow that acceptance was in coming it was not until early in the th century that negro with a capital n was freely used by almost everyone in fact when the naacp was founded in the organization that was to spearhead for years the fight for equal rights for negroes was called the national association for the advancement of colored people once accepted the name found little opposition among either blacks or whites and negroes ranging in shades and looks from ike white to nearly black see opposite page readily admitted their brotherhood as negroes black people talked of negro schools negro businesses negro rights negro society it became an established knowledge throughout the world that a negro was an american of african descent a descendant of africans originally brought into this countiy as slaves it has been only within the last decade that there has been any concerted effort among black americans particularly among the young to do away with the word negro the name game is not new s pointed out in the article whats in a name nov by ebony senior editor and historian lerone bennett jr there is nothing new about black americans and the name game according to mr bennett some years ago when spanish and portuguese slae traders transported captured africans to the west indies and south america they called them negroes spanish and portuguese for blacks and that slavetraders who followed used the same teim the slaves themselves seemed to have resented the term and preferred to be called africans the early black men in the united states both slave and free used african in naming their institutionstlie free african society the african methodist episcopal church the african baptist church but according to mr bennett the americans of african descent made a quick switch early in the th century when the american colonization society organized a movement to send free africans back to africa the coloured community reacted by abandoning the word african in favor of the words coloured andor tree persons of colour says mr bennett from then until the civil war colored american was the accepted teim in times of racial stress ccording to mr bennett times of racial stress usually turned out to be die times when the name game was played the hardest during and immediately after the civil war militant black americans seized upon the word negro as their preferred designation rather than colored or afroamerican after the reconstruction colored was still used predominantly but strong leaders such as frederick douglass and booker t washington used the word negro and after the turn of the century negro began to acquire a dignity that it had not generally held before the cuitent controversy over just what black americans prefer to be called owes its virulence to the failure of america to follow up the promise of a solution to the race problem in the s with a successful conclusion in the early s in this time of crisis the negro militants have come full circle back to the late th century with a ferv ent attempt to strengthen the ties with an african heritage through the use of terms such as afroamerican african american or black with a capital b a question of number t the conclusion of mr bennetts article wtiats in a name ebony printed a coupon on which interested persons could on their own initiative suggest the name that they preferred to be called in the months that followed some readers sent in their couponsusually accompanied by lengthy letters defending their choices since the letters represented far less tlian onetenth of one per cent of the more than four million readers who see ebony each month and since the letters were sent in on strictly a voluntar basis no truly scientific conclusions could be arrived at but they did provide some interesting reading and they were tabulated of those who did make choices per cent preferred afroamerican per cent named black per cent chose african american per cent preferred negro and per cent favored colored the others suggested names such as afram overseasafrican soul people moorish american brown americans americans bantu bantuncse and originals only time can tell o nly time can tell whether the current controversy will mark a major change in how black americans will be addressed by the majority of both black and whites in this country but that is not truly the problem of current times of far more importance in this th century is how the black american will be treated will he be accorded the dignity of manhood which his contributions to this nation should long ago have earned him will the white man change his racist ways and accept the black man an american since before the revolution as the full citizen he legally is will the black american dispel himself of all feehngs of inferiority and walk proudly as a man within this society if these things do not come to pass the black american no matter what he be called will continue to protest and his protest can take an even more militant form than it has in the past if whites and blacks cannot solve their problemsand solve them soonthe united states will lose all claim on being a democracy offering freedom and equality to all and may well end up as a nation with nothing but material vvealth to offer as

detroit common council thought the city ought to have here is the list m carbines gauge shotguns stoner machine guns calibre rifles with x scopes infrared snooper scopes flak vests gas masks chemical mace dispensers sets of fatigue clothing rounds of various kinds of ammunition the only item eliminated from the original administration list says frank joyce who heads the detroitbased people against racism par was the detroit air force socalled which was to have consisted of one helicopter and one fixedwing aircraft couneilmen scratched those items off the list the stoners and mls and mace dispensers would deal with next summers fires thats what was going on in one part of detroit politicians in panic police preparing for massacre but in another part that part of blacktown that had been streaked by fire and now lay in smoldering ruin a group of detroit businessmen stepped over broken glass and litter and took unfamiliar steps toward the headquarters of the east side voice of independent detroit a wemustcontroltheghetto organization run by frank ditto one of detroits black militant young men dittos shabby mack avenue place was new ground for men used to axminsters and walnut paneling used to presiding over the affairs of say michigan bell telephone co and the j l hudson department store but there they were joseph l hudson himself michigan bell president william m day and some othersall highpositioned pauls sitting at the feet of a black gamaliel rich white men trying to understand as best as rich white men can why the slums of their model city had stirred ditto took them by their minds and led them through an hour or so of black frustration and black despair and told them how really angry black people are he told them because they had come to blacktown to find out that they could either let black anger take its wellknown course or they could get busy and relieve that anger you cats cant do it its never goztg to get done is what frank ditto told them he told them that the stoners and mace might work but that after it was all over they might have just a shell of a town that talk and a day of poking around in blacktown brought certain things into focus for the holders of power in detroit it was just horrible no wonder people riot is what william m day said the experience resulted in a new commitment for dav and the others they are now prime movers of the new detroit committee a member power structure group that includes such men as general motors president james m roche chrysler chairman lynn townsend and henry ford ii chairman of ford the group is determined to wade into detroits slums and use business methods and business money to tackle problems that local politicians and federal programs of all kinds have failed to solve ndc member companies are lending their brightest peoplefrom personnel experts to systems analystsfor the task and money to do the job is limited only by what each company wants to give already million has been committed for a studv of wavs to refonn the detroit police department but beyond this the ndc is concerned with the whole range of ghetto ills how to upgrade the disadvantaged how to snatch unemployables out of pool halls and off street corners and motivate them and make them able to work how to dissolve the ghettos or at least brighten them and make them livable how to break through the vicious cycle of welfarism and integrate the black poor into an affluent society what the ndc is determined to do in detroit private industry is attemptingboth on a singlecompany basis and as part of such organizations as the urban coalition and the national alliance of businessmenon a national scale the urban coalition was formed in the winter of during the off season between summer riots it went into high gear only last august after newark and detroit an emergency convocation in wasliington brought together more than business religious labor civil_rights and local government leaders and the uc called upon the nation to end once and for all the shame of poverty amid general affluence then under cochairmen andrew heiskell of time inc and a philip randolph president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters it went on record in favor of massive emergency job programsat least a million jobsfor the ghetto unemployed and called for increased federal spending for poverty programs and construction of at least a million lowcost housing units a year the urban coalition called too for a major expansion of the private sectors efforts to train and provide jobs for the hardcore unemployed seizing on this president johnson early this year called for a national alliance of businessmen and appointed henry ford ii as chairman since then ford has been going from city to city calling together men who control jobs in each town and evangelizing for the nab goal jobs for the hardcore unemployed by of them by next juneand x jobs this summer for youth out of school the nab approach is a simple one businessmen like ford call on other businessmen not with a gun or molotov cocktail or threat of boycott in hand but says ford in a spirit of persuasion and with a sense of national urgency the businessmen are asked to sign pledges that they will hold a certain number of job openingsabout two in each for hardcore cases these are according to the nab definition people who fall into one or more of the following categories poor people who are unemployed school dropouts the handicapped exconvicts negroes and other minoritiesbetween the ages of and and above the hardcore cases will be drawn from key cities which the nab lists as most in need businessmen are told quite frankly that the hardcore will present problems these are the people they are told who feel permanently locked into the ghetto who despair of ever finding a job who must be almost literally dragged out of pool halls and wine joints and led to an employment office to be hired according to nab contracts with firms these same hardcore persons must be guaranteed a productive job not simply makework or dead end positions they must be trained for that job and somehow motivated to stay there only then can hiring firms qualify for a share of the million that president johnson has promised for extraordinary costs for training and a whole variety of supportive services including medical services they cant work if theyre sick and even costs of transportation when necessary to and from the job by midapril the nab had received pledges f jobs permanent ones for the hardcore and summer jobs for youths what businessmen are doing has not been without economic risks when j l hudson led an open housing fight last november and even went down to the michigan state capitol to throw his considerable weight behind the bill customers closed their accounts at his huge detroit store and henry ford has said that every time he makes a pronouncement in behalf of black peoples rights ford sales tumble in the south but pord still maintains people who dont face up to this issue arc stupid its a great opportunity for business its shortsighted not to step in and do something to solve the problems for the vcr peace and national unity of our country are at stake what about industry acting privatelyout from under the umbrella of the urban coalition and the nab the eastman kodak co offers good examples kodak which employs of every persons working in its headquarters city rochester n y was one of the first companies in the nation to join president kennedys plans for progress program in it has always been rather proud of its image as an equal opportunity employer but rochesters militant ficht organization picketed kodak charging it didnt have enough black employees kodaks annual stockholders meeting was disrupted some controllers of large blocks of eastman stock threatened a proxy war by the end of last year kodak had black workers and per cent of everyone hired during were black thats still not enough the militants say but kodak has moved in other directions too it has broadened its professional recruiting base to include visits to some negro colleges each year and more negro professional and technical grads are being hired as for bluecollar workers the company trains hardcore young men in special trades and last year more than personsmost of them negroes and puerto ricanswere hired into kodaks training programs in the rochester community kodak has joined other local industries to support rochester jobs inc which finds about jobs a montli for the liardcore teens on patrol tops a project in which youths are given policerelated jobs around high schools swim areas and playgrounds and rochester business opportunities corporation wliich helps ghetto residents expand existing businesses or go into business for themselves i believe we at kodak are trying to do what we should do says kodak board chairman william s vaughn not far from kodaks corporate headquarters is that of the giant xerox corporation where an interesting experiment is now in its third year this is project step upa week training program for unemployed men who might have police records bad credit ratings and spotty employment histories xer classroom instruction informal counseling on personal problems and patient guidance in the whole work experience the men begin their classroom day with topflight teachers and lessons in arithmetic reading writingall the basic courses in spelling for example an instructor flashes the word be on a screen for a split second and asks will that be sting you the men some of whom could not write their names a short time before say no and laugh a xerox foreman who works with such new trainees says never have i seen such enthusiasm theyre eager theyre willing and they want to learn roger allgood who had worked as a sandblaster laundromat manager and stockman in a grocery store came to project step up when he was he said the program changed my whole life so many people say the devil with even trying allgood said t cant read they say or they say t cant work so whats the use this program can change ideas like that among the first men in project step up was ned usscry a georgia native who had floated from job to job as a construction laborer worker in a lumber plant then a chair factory then a service station his last job before coming to xerox was as a janitor i have a wife and six children he said i want something better for them and for my life thats why im here one hears such stories wherever men like allgood and ussery are now being unlocked from lives of frustration and despair and are being given new hope the places are many at rochesters eastman kodak co where there are some training courses ranging from typing to filmmaking to laboratory scienccs to machine skills at control data corporation in minneapolis where unemployables are being taught to manufacture precision parts at mcdonnell douglas corp the big aerospace firm in st louis where men and women who had neither high school diplomas nor special skills were integrated into a space age production system that demands accuracy and precise workmanship were late in doing this and it was under pressure says kaiser industries vice president norman nicholson but well not cry about past history the door is open now the door is open now too at the industry giants general motors chrysler and ford though gm has some black employes nationwide there were always even for laborer jobs certain educational barriers that the disadvantaged couldnt crash now a gm executive says mainly all a man has to do these days is be able to read the safety signs thus gm has added some black workers since last summer by waiving most educational requirement for jobs the same thing has happened at ford where job openings have been set aside for onthespot hiring and chrysler is now bringing in men whose police records would have been against them before in the communications industry american telephone telegraph co has in the last four years doubled the number of black workers in the vast bell system from to and western electric bells manufacturing and supply arm has just moved into the newark n j riot area with a employe training center and plant the pacesetter in industrys new program of bringing work right to the people in the ghetto is aerojetgeneral the west coast subsidiary of general tire rubber co when vice president humphrey after the riots called on business to do something for watts aerojetgenerals chairman dan a kimball who had lived in watts as a boy made a quick decision the result was the establishment in august of the watts manufacturing co a subsidiary of aerojetgeneral but an independent negromanaged operation whose first contract was a million one to produce military tents for the defense department today the or so workers at the company are all drawn right from the ghetto some have acquired skills that can earn them as much as a day how successful has watts mfg co been it has an order backlog of some niillioti is planning to put on about more workers and has reached the break even pointall in less

announced last september that its member companies would divert billion of investment funds from safe channels and use them instead to upgrade slum real estate has put its program into high gear within a month after the announcement million had been committed in slum mortgages and though gilbert fitzhugh chairman of metropolitan life pleased stockholders by saying were making investments not giving anything away the industry is holding interest at per cent in a market where sonic lenders are earning to per cent and more one company prudential life has set aside million for such investments and million of that is already at work as ghetto loans while the insurance industry is building new housing units oilier companies are moving into the ghetto to rehabilitate the old homes

the area of education for ghetto youth in detroit michigan bell telephone co has adopted northern high school and chrysler has adopted northwestern high for both allblack schools the mother industry is providing business experts for revamping of curricula and teaching techniques and industry money is being used to buy new equipment for classrooms and shops to hire additional teachers and add more

race but i w ill vigorously protest the crude propaganda device he uses itj telling your readers that the word negro is a bad word ixcause it means dead the prefix necro found in necromancy does indeed mean dead but it cfimes from the creek nrhro a dead bd or person the word negro comes from the latin niger black all dictionaries i have seen state that necromancy evolved through folk usage this came about because the two root words were confused and interchanged thus necromancy came to mean black magic fleming x also says that negro is a name given to us by the caucasians correct just as caucasian is a name given to whites and mongolian is a name given to the rest of mankind to classjf them scientifically i cannot suggest a new word to further set the black man apart from the

eiiuality call it a holy war and say that every true human being must join it wc in the east are all with you our newspapers and magazines are always full of support for you another interesting thing which i see in your magazine is all the ads for hairstraighteners i was amused to imagine your people spending tlieir money on having their hair straightened while people here are spending their money on having their hair curled thick curly hair is a thing of leauty here which of course is rare guess its human nature that we always long to hac wliat does not belong to us even tliough what belongs to us may be more wonderful than what we long to have i invite your readers to write to me i am my job is airconditioning and my hobby is handreading muhammad ameen doha qatar arabian gulf more about hair there is much to be said both for and against the natural but one cannot accept mr llorens theory of viewing it as a new symbol of race pride and ending the description there a more accurate statement would have been new symbol of race pride for many those who view it as a fad have certainly gone overboard here in los ngcles for i have seen the natural in red platinum blonde and streaked on women and men as well as being in such a state of growth that one wonders if the wearer has racial or personal pride as for the business of the natural attire african garb etc one wonders how the american scene would look if each ethnic group decided to parade in contuines native to their ancestriil homes extremism in any form can be nauseating and unfortunately many have carried the natural concept just that far doing a tremendous disservice to themselves the many people who lmk like a million dollars with it and the entire idea of the natural in its positive and construetive sense the subject is much too important to be given such a superficial treatment fat on unfunny comments and lean on serious discussion heres hoping to see installment number two verv soon exrl j young jr los

washed it in the morning and had done nothing to it then said he why not go to the hairdresser and get it fixed in an afro l m cowxn wasliington d c i proudly vvoro a natural only a few davs ago before my ncoic gave me a direct order to get it cut or prepare for a courtmartial we brothers in the war feel this same pride which is radiating so brightly on the flip side of our society civilian but the depressor says we cant wear our symbol of pride so now i am a regular customer of the base barber unfortunately mahvin pic kett travis afb calif being a negro vvoman i want ou to know that each time i walk down the street and see another woman of iny race wearing one of those hideous naturals i lun so humiliated i could cry they are positively revolting frankly in my opinion the true reason for the natural is just plain laziness especially as far as the females are eoneerued the lkst thing that ev er hapjxned for my people so far as hair and grooming is concerned is the w ig and permanents and i would suggest to all of ihose natural wearers to hurry uji and get one or the other and lcxk like human leings again sinuley a drake los angeles calif the men on your great cover attest to one fact black is beautiful marshall d alstov washiiiglon d c i am disgusted with all negroes who wear the naturals i hav e yet to see a negro with one who looked other than apelike surely there are other ways to symlxilize race pride other than looking like monkeys being a negro am attempting to rear my children to be proud of their race through their accomplishments not their woolly heads all the naturals do is accentuate the negatives that kind of pride our racc can do without m in my opinion the negroes who dress and wear their hair like africans are contradicting themselves in fighting to be treated like americans when i iiscd to overhear a white person saying they should send all negroes back to africa i could proudly walk over and defend my race now when something like

completely cut off from the knowledge of black accomplishments in america ebony has filled that void with its articles on the black man in american historv i am nery grateful to ebony for fulfilling this need of mine and im sure of many other black americans as for myself i say that nn ih continue to subscribe to ebony as long as articles of this nature continue to be a part of its informative

publications you have ever offered to the public each and every one was profoundly interesting and a great credit to the american negro back in when i was in england i wrote to you stating that i did not see your magazine on the hook stands there you replic tl that you would take affirmative action on this matter which you did before left there i noticed ith great enthusiasm that ebony was being sold there black people in england seemed to have a special joy in being able to read interesting news about their fellow men in america and around the world nowadays with black nationalism reaching its zenith here in this country it is not an uncommon sight to visit black peoples homes to see ebony colorfully decorating their homes i will agree that it is a treasure house of knowledge and beauty

in south vietnam writing this letter to you this letter is intended for the average soul brother who lives on the deadend street of the cities without a heart i want to talk to you because ive lived on that same street i know your desires aspirations and your dreams i am also aware of the anxiety and frustrations that youve encountered while trying to become absorbed in tire mainstream of american life i was in korea in when you loudly and dcstructiely let it be knoum that you were dissatisfied with your conditions in the watts section of los angeles i had just arrived in vietnam when you rioted in detroit in the summer of there have been many riots similar to watts and detroit maybe not as big but all of them have caused damage to property some of them have caused death to innocent people including women and kids i know those riots were a fonn of protest against a society that is oriented toward racism since ive lived on our street i know firsthand of the deplorable conditions that youve leen forced to accept therefore i am not going to ask why protest i do not expect you to accept these inferior conditions with a complacent attitude i cannot how eer condone the violence and destniction causetl by these proteststhe rioting burning and looting especially of liquor stores have no tactical significance even if it were a revolution because the very people that are supposed to be helped are the ones hurt the most i am not going to be so presumptuous as to think that you can get everything merely by asking therefore i expect you to protest against all unfair conditions but those protests shoidd be orderly because i believe there are enough responsible people of good will who are w illing to work with us in a coordinated effort to improve our conditions yes protest demonstrate if neccssar because you deserve everything your country has to offer but let your protest be without the rioting burning and looting that has been so prevalent in the past i do not expect you to let somebody hit you without retaliating because i am not prepared to do that i do howeer expect you to conduct yoursebcs as responsible citizens of the united states it is your duty as responsible citizens to exixct and demand the best that your country has to offer many black gis have fought and died bravely for you to enjoy all of the privileges that every other american enjoysyes you have a right to protest but let your protests be orderly without the unnecessary violence that damages property and causes the loss of innocent lives a humanist in africa letters to

complex subject is to devote an e ntire issue to stories covering every phase of tliat subject in the past ebony has used the special issue technicpie to infonn readers fully on such subjects as the white problem in america tlie negro woman and negro youth in america each of these issues has ixen tremendously effective not only in inforining our regular readers but in reaching influential voices in government education and social work the white problem in america brought home to thousands of while americans their responsibility in rcsobing the civil_rights dilemma in this country leading sociologists and psychologists have made frequent references to the negro woman and social workers in ghetto neighborlukkls have written to tell how that issue has helped them to a better understanding of the negro families with whom they deal each day members of the presidents commission on civil disorders all read the special issue on negro youth and no doubt found it helpful in arriving at their conclusions currently ebony staffers arc working on another special issue for this august the subject to be announced in july was arrived at after many meetings of the staff with

human reproduction the one who makes the decision between life and nonlife each is a dc ice for birth control every day it seems it becomes easier for a woman to not have a child federal and social agencies are reducing the mysteries of conception to a banal routine and are prescribing contraceptives to almost any woman who wants sexwithout risks but there are questions how do these drugs and devices work will they harm the body affect sexual desires is it right to tamper witli the normal reproductive function or for one indiv idual to decide whether another should give birth to a child and now across america black people are raising even deeper queries is birth control just a white mans plot to contain the black population is it just another scheme to cut back on welfare aid or still another method of keeping the black man down the questions come mainly from the black ghetto middleclass negroes have accepted contraceptive practices well and they come not only because of concern about containment and vvclfare cutbacks but also because of a very prevalent idea that birth control actually means black genocide that was the key phrase in an antibirth control resolution passed at last suininers black_power conference in newark since then opposition to birth control has grown the opposition ranges from that of a small california group called eros efforts to increase our size which picketed vvhen a physician lectured on family planning to that found in pittsburgh where black people have organized strong protests against planned parenthood programs to that of new yorks ultramilitant fiv e percenters whose spokesman has said see that sister there shes having another baby for me i need an army and this is how were going to get it in pittsburgh dr charles greenlee health committee chairman of the pittsburgh nvacp and naacp branch president bvrd brown have charged that planned parenthood the international family planning agency has coerced disadv antaged black people to employ birth control by sending workers doortodoor until women feel they are forced to go to a clinic the workers are untrained in any medical specialty dr greenlee says but ask questions about a womans pregnancies her personal habits and such things as whether she and her husband use contraceptives i dont oppose contraceptives per se dr greenlee says but im against this pillpushing in black neighborhoods where many people are made to feel that theyd better obey official suggestions to isit a birth control clinic or risk losing tbeir monthly welfare check several years ago dr greenlee remembers the pittsburgh department of public aid mailed welfare checks along with notices about pap tests the vaginal smear test for detection of cancer in women a lot of husbands didnt know what the tests were all about but since the notices had come in the same envelope with the welfare checks the husbands showed up at clinics for pap tests too fearing that doortodoor pillpushing will spread to other cities dr greenlee warns our birth rate is the only thing we have if we keep on producing theyre going to have to either kill us or grant us full citizenship family planning workers and doctors say that the loudest protestors against birth control are men not women says one worker the black mans opposition has a lot to do with his virility hangup they like to brag about the number of kids theyve fathered they think its the ultimate proof of their manhood says another ive found that many men feel insecure about a wife who uses birth control why this insecurity well they feel that the pill for cxamplc puts the wife on an equal sexual plane with themthat it makes it easier for women to twotime because theres little or no danger of pregnancy getting through to such men was the task gi en some time ago by the late black humorist langston hughes to his folk character simple it takes minutes to have a baby said simple and years to take care of it you young people these days having babies at the drop of a hatand some of you not even marriedought to peer ahead to see where your children are going to hang their hats tomorrow now the problem is how to keep from adding more and more unexpectcd children from unexpcctant mothers to the welfare rolls you saw what the papers said the other day how many millions of dollars the welfare is costing taxpayers in new york cityincluding meevery year for surplus children none of them unexpectcd children is mine about half of them is teenagers childrenteenagers not even married yet nor old enough to get married unless their parents take time to go down to city hall to giv e permission for them to get hitched before the next baby comes just think of all them little babies tumbling into the world with nothing to say about being born at all and nobody with a dime to buy them a diaper simples argument is dramatically enforced by census figures although critics charge that official figures discriminate against the poor wealthy whites can afford private clinic abortions which would cut down on the official white birth rate but if figures are to be believed the black illegitimate birth rate has risen from per cent to per cent of all black births since the corresponding rate for white illegitimate births has gone only from per cent to per cent further three out of four such white babies are adopted while only one out of ten such black babies are adopted the remaining nine black babies usually end up on aid to dependent children adc rolls still the birth control opposition persists tlie militants arguments are believed theyre just trying to save moiuy on welfare its just another scheme to keep black men down such organizations as planikd parenthood have to cope with the argumentsand with certain fears that ghetto women have the organizations douglas stewart director of the national office of community relations says many negro women have told our workers there are two kinds of pillsone for white women and one for us and the one for us causes sterilization this is a verv real fear for some women perhaps its because many of them arc from the south where black people have hcard of instances of unvvarrantd stc rilization bv white clinic vvorkers whose attitude seems to be lets get the negro before hes born these women bring their fears and suspicions with them vvhen they move north it is stewarts job to relieve these fears he says it is my opinion as director of community relations that birth control programs might fare better in large cities if more black people and members of minority groups were represented on planning boards of clinics in their neighborhoods he adds perhaps that would soften the white plot idea which leaves so many uninformed people caught between pressures from militant groups and their own washes for fewer children the naivete of the uninformed young wmman can be seen at any one of the hundreds of family planning classes that are being held around the country in chicago for example at operation venus a federallyfunded program sponsored by the citys commission on youth welfare a teenage mother asks a nurse is it true that ril have acne if i dont have sex with my boyfriend he always says honey itll clear up your skin i thought so too but i have two babies now and i still have acne another girl wants to know if the pill she takes will sterilize a man mv bovfriend told me it would hurt him if i took those pills she confided with patience the nurse explains everything were not here to encourage you to use birth control she says but simply to inform you that there are alternatives to being pregnant all the time seeking these alternatives black women are crowding the waiting rooms of birth control clinics in almost every goodsize city ive heard all the talk about genocide and such things says a tiredlooking woman of at clevelands bell neighborhood center clinic what the black_power people wantwell thats their business and i guess theres nothing wrong with it but fve had eight babies and two miscarriages and honest to god i just cant have no more birth control is my only salvation it is for such a woman and for young couples wanting to limit family size that science is proiding a salvation today of the estimated million wouumi who use birth control in the u s million of them take oral contraceptivesthe pill these tiny pills were first marketed in under the name enovid and during the past seven years manufacturers of this and similar drugs have been doing a booming business sales will reach million this year alone up million since a recent survey showed that per cent of americas gynecologists would recommend the pill to their patients as a safe drug although scientists have not conclusively determined longrange effects of the pill manufacturers have marketed it under different brand names and the u s food and drug administration has lifted a fourvear limit on the continual use of the pill by a woman since the first birth control pill the dosage in todays preventative has decreased to onetenth of its original strength in the result is a marked reduction of annoying sideeffects such as nausea head aches and bleeding there are two types of pills type a a combination of the female honnoncs estrogen and progestin a drug extracted from plants to simulate the natural hormone progesterone taken days per month type b called sequential a day sefuence of estrogen pills followed by five days of combined estrogenprogestin pills both types work on the simple theory that no woman can become pregnant once she is already bearing a child the pills cause a fake pregnancy by increasing those hormones normally secreted during a real pregnancy these hormones prevent the forming of the female tgg and the continuation of the monthly ovulation with the pill and the ingestion of additional hormones in her system the woman cannot conetjive because the egg cannot form and at the end of the cycle she will menstruate normally the difference between the two pills is slight the combination pills are supposedly more reliable than the seqiientials on the other hand doctors say the seqiientials caiise less discomfort with both types gynecologists report that some women experience one or more sideeffects during the first few months of use these include weight gain swelling of the extremities and abdomen dizziness nausea eye disorders irregular bleeding diminished menstrual flow and breast soreness these discomforts duplicate those which occur during many normal pregnancies however responsible physicians insist that they examine women on the pill at least once or even twice a year to check on the drugs effect the pill does have its faults as a contraceptive mainly because most women do not fully understand how hormones affect the system and that a missed pill during the monthly cycle can mean an unwanted pregnancy more than two times as many cxillegeediicated women take the pill successfully as do women with less than a high school education why because the unsophisticated or uneducated woman has to be taught to take the hormones regularly mrs polly staples a nurse for planned parenthood in chicago can report innumerable misunderstandings about the pill one girl only took the pill when she had sexual relations another swallowed the entire monthly dosage just to be sure before she went out on a date both were indignant and bewildered when they found themsck es pregnant other methods prescribed by birth control clinics include intrauterine devices sometimes called the iud the coil or the loop the diaphragm a rubber cup fitted individually by a physician and which covers the opening of the womb and is inserted before sexual relations spermicidal foams and jellies which kill sperm if injected into the womb before intercourse the douche made with water soapsuds or vinegar and used after intercourse rhythm the method used by some catholics which limits the days during which the couple may have intercourse and the condom a rubber device worn hv a man to prevent sperm from entering the womb physicians credit the iud as the most effective contraceptive method next to the pill even the ancient egyptians successfnlly used primitive iud devices the modern loop or coil is inserted into the uterus and is lft there indefinitely although doctors are not sure why iuds prevent fertilization the method is unpopular with many women because the deice can slip out unnoticed or when left in can cause some unpleasant symptoms such as uterine cramps or bleeding the least effective methods are the rhythm and douche practices the most successful is sterilization a relatively simple operation for either a man or a woman contrary to superstition sterilization docs not affect the individuals sexual enjoyment and the operation can be reversed in per cent of the cases for the male one of the most successful new contraceptives is deladroxate an injection tspe which has just undergone two years of tests at meharry medical college in nashville a threeman team headed by dr w f bernell james director of gynecology tested the drug on women volunteers from the nashville area at the end of the test period the team called deladroxate a success manufactured by e r squibb and sons deladroxate is like the pill a combination of estrogen and progestin but in different proportions it is injected onccamonth into a muscle on the th day following onset of menstruation deladroxale is then absorbed slowly to approximate daily dosages of the pill writing in the journal of the national medical assn dr james reported that women who took deladroxate experienced no unwanted pregnancies or ill effects a nationwide test involving fk women showed similar results barring any future complications deladroxate sliould soon be available for women who want it a flock of new drugs and techniques may follow deladroxate thi sc include a minipill taken not days per month as with the present pill but every day per month the minipill consists of the same two hormones in the pill used today but in smaller amounts approximately onefourth dosage many women may find this new pill easier to take because it eliminates the worry of adhering to the day cycle contraceptives for even longer periods lasting from three months to years are under consideration researchers are now testing rats with a year capsule planted under the skin the tiny capsule contains a progesteronelike hormone which seeps into the blood stream at a ver slow rate when fertilization is desired the capsule is removed in another experiment an ohio doctor is testing a day eflfective injection of a drug called medroxyprogesterone even an antisperm vaccination may soon become a possibility physicians have found that some prostitutes develop antibodies to sperm over a period of time and tltat tins allows them to hax sexual relations without becoming pregnant if researchers could isolate that antibody they could perhaps develop a vaccine for women similarly there is discussion of a vaccine that would render the male sperm sterile with all of the antibirth control arguments in mind just what are the arguments for family planning in ghetto areas there is a very important health measure that ought to be considered says university of chicago obstetrician dr joseph swartwout who has worked in birth control clinics for the indigent and who has treated thousands of women both negro and white many doctors are concerned he says because this runaway reproductionespecially in our cities ghettoshas caused a ery poor quality of reproduction we see prematurity toxemia anemia inflammation of the veins phlebitis and many other sideeffects among women with more than four children prematurity is generally three times higher with poor women than with middleclass women mental retardation is nine times higher in the ghetto what does this mean it means that these babies start life not only in the ghetto but with less than their full genetic quota less than years ago the doctor could not hac said this for the woman had no choicesex meant babies whether she wanted them or not in margaret sanger a nurse worked in the ghettos of new york city her revulsion mounted as she saw the result of uncontrolled pregnancies and birth complications from then on she worked tirelessly for birth control and triggered a relution when she organized her supporters into her planned parenthood league this agency now describes her early fight working among the poor she had seen the heartaches caused bv unwanted children and had heard similar pleas a thousand times she had always wondered angrily why women should be denied the knowledge which could sae them such misery and their verv li es and it is planned parenthoods vow to continue with her work planned parenthood does not stand alone in its conictions there are many negro leaders who acti ely support birth control the first legislator in the nation to propose voluntary family planning information for welfare recipients was a negro william robinson now a member of planned parenthoods executive board remembers his white colleagues called his proposal political suicide his stand today is seconded by whitney young executive director of the urban lcagne who says we are concerned with the strengthening of family life and reducing individual and family dependency since margaret sangers early eiforts another birth control revolution may now be in the makingthe federal sponsorship of family planning agencies in and the office of economic opportunity has increased its birth control funds from million to million not only did the department of health education and welfare create a new post to coordinate family planning activities but this agency spent a minimum of million this year for birth control services more important some citizens feel is the federal freeze on subsidies to state aid to dependent children programs this freeze would limit federal funds to the number of children on state welfare as of jan this year this would put more responsibility on each state to find funds this year for those additional children specifically for those children under is with only one parent and many individuals say this means a bigger push for birth control in poor areas but it is martin_luther_king jr who proves to be the most eloquent voice for family planning in his acceptance of the margaret sanger award in human rights he says there is a striking kinship between our civil_rights movement and margaret sangers early efforts she like we saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life negroes have no mere academic nor ordinary interest in family planning they have a special and urgent concern for the negro therefore intelligent guides of family planning are a profoundly important ingredient in his quest for security and a decent life there are mountainous obstacles still separating negroes from a normal existence yet one element in stabilizing his life would be an understanding of and easy access to the means to dexelop a family related in size to his community environment and to the income xotcntial he can command there is scarcely anything more tragic in human life than a child who is not wanted he career plans of the above three negro college students are not mere pipe dreams the sort of jobs they seek are available to them even though the nations negro unemployment total hovers around the mark while most of the unemployed are unskilled or unemployable because of age disability or other reasons thousands of jobs for trained people go begging yearly every new technological breakthrough like the dramatic shift in the radiotv industry from vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits generates a need for more trained manhours of design production and maintenance each population increase enlarges the task of housing teaching nursing feeding moving directing imd informing masses of people thus todays college students are potential beneficiaries of a nationwide shortage of whitecollared officials managers professionals techcareer opportunities are expanding for the coiiegetrained despite widespread race bias nicians and sales personnel partially because of this shortage ov er the past seven years the number of whitecollar jobs held by negroes has increased per cent it does not follow however that the job market is a paradise for negro college graduates in the first combined areabyarea and industrybyindustry survey ever conducted in this country the equal employment opportunity commission recently found whitecollar workers generally are to per cent of all employes but for negroes specifically the range drops down to from to per cent with the lowest figures falling in the south see above map in atlanta for cample the survey revealed negroes make up per cent of all workers but hold only per cent of the whitecollar jobs they occupy per cent of the whitecollar posts in san francisco while making up per cent of the workers surveyed negroes are per cent of clevelands workers but hold only per cent of the whitecollar jobs furthennore most of their gains in such employment have been confined to government jobs xalmost per cent of the postal workers in los angeles are nonwhite for example as are per cent of detroits school teachers so while barriers in the private sector hav e been dropping negro representation in the business world is still relatively small and it is virtually nonexistent so far as the top jobs are concerned these facts are grim challenges to negro college graduates kacial discrimination still prevents them from picking and choosing jobs as freely as their vvhite counterparts nevertheless the happy irony is that jobs for them are av ailable and in increasing numbers i ook where the sun rises is the advice job consultant richard l clarke offers to college graduates just entering the nations job market his experience as head of new yorks richard clarke associates helps him single out the northeast new yorkbostonphildelphia complex as the best location for whitecollar job hunters he urges them to avoid areas like detroit which are chronically plagued by strikes and production layoffs like clarke ulric st clair haynes jr president of new yorks management resources corp jxssists corporate clients in their search for new sources of minority group talent he contends anybody who says that there are not enough qualified negro professionals around is just perpetuating a myth that has long been used to exclude us haynes complains many businesses search for negro white collar workers in the wrong places for instance they look to business schools for talent but a recent survey found no more than negroes among the students attending graduate schools of business one of the reasons why negroes do not tend to seek careers in managerial positions in business and industry haynes contends is that there are so very few negroes in such positions with whom they can identify this is not the case when it comes to careers in teaching the law the ministry civil ser ice and medicine these of course have been the traditional occupational slots for collegetrained negroes but both clarkes and haynes firms have exposed negro college graduates to broader occupational opportunities paralleling their efforts are new yorks manpower survey and research inc headed by charles l fields and plan of action for challenging times pact a san francisco firm headed by everett p brandon all agree that despite persistent racial barriers prospects are excellent for negro college graduates v ice president hubert h humphreys clay mile jaunt through nine african countries was more than a highlevel tourist trip but less than an indepth exploration of the black continent he had come he said repeatedly to listen and learn but he saw little of the real africathe village and bush instead he was largely confined to the establishment in each country mainly visiting presidents prime ministers and cabinet members and labor educational and religious leaders when humphrey landed in one country he was escorted at the airport by a u s ambassador who whispered were insulating you from the crowd for your own safetv but the minnesota politician doe into a nearby throng and shook hands anyway at kinshasa in the congo about students pelted the vice presidents car motorcade near a memorial to patrice lumumba the deposed premier who was slain in the students also ripped an american flag to shreds yet thousands of other congolese hailed their american visitor pictures of humphreys tour in the us press revealed nothing of how he defied security precautions ignored antiafrican attitudes in the us and converted what many at first thought would be a big bust into a fairly successful goodwill safari during most of his quick tour of africa humphrey was tired and at times exasperated yet he managed to get some feel for the continents problems his man delegation of businessmen bankers trade unionists educators publishers and health specialists fanned out on specific missions in each country to determine what is netded and what the us can do to help the united states must plan an active role within our means in africa million people in nations cannot be left to the care of former colonial powers humphrey later reported africans want us and our help if they do not receive it communist penetration can fill the vacuum the proposal for humphreys trip came almost accidentally last december when president johnson dropped in on a weekly whito house meeting that the vice president usually holds with african ambassadors to washington president johnson asked the group what he could do for them congress had cut us aid to africa from million to million and limited its help to countries such a restrictive policy had not been imposed on any other continent the ambassadors requested that president johnson dispatch the vice president on an african tour and within a few weeks the most traveled presidential backstop in historv was airborne en route to africa in air force a presidential jet reporters wondered whether humphrey was africabound because of the coming presidential election and the crucial negro vote was his trip a way of coiinterlialancing anticipated republican efforts to highlight us discrimination against africa suspicions that party politics was a powerful motive bchind the vice presidents tour gained even greater credence when sen edward brooke rmass left on a day african tour a few hours after humphrey returned to washington d c how much u s involvement in africa becomes a political issue for negro voters remains academic few major negro organizations arc in rapport with african groups and there is a noticeable lack of concern among negro voters even about the congressional cuthack of aid to africa commenting on this apathy one african official said we dont expect you to come back here to lie or e en work youre americans but we do feel that if you say you are our brothers youd be interested in helping shape a foreign policy that doesnt discriminate against us such discrimination is dramatized by this countrys lack of significant action against portugueseheld angola and mozambique the union of south africa and southern rhodesia these whitesupremacist regimes lie south of the zambezi ri er to the north are million africans many of them angry enough to trigger what experts predict will be a major explosion on the african continent this prospect complicated humphreys task of making americas position clear to african leaders he repeatedly told them i want africans to know that the u s cares about their welfare we havent forgotten you but he had little to offer or promise his hosts except funds for projects already approved by the u s government speaking to representatives of the organization of african unityan alliance of independent statesin addis ababas africa hall plumphrey declared america is opposed at inaugural for president tubman hnmphrev chats with liberias bead and liis wife ceremonies were v iewed by ambassador chester carter and u s supreme court justice thurgood marshall there is remarkable goodvvill toward the united states among lxth leaders and people the vice president reported after returning to the united states lt general joseph a ankrah chairman of the national liberation council in ghana shares comment with humphrey and u s ambassador franklin williams far right ghana plans to return to civilian rule soon zambia president kenneth kaiinda and mrs kaunda were gracious hosts to humphreys veep promised funds to build railroad connecting landlocked country with tanzanian port of dar es salaam red china has promised million for road to segregation discrimination exploitation and social injustice the us he said supports selfdetermination territorial integrity national independence and majority rule it is committed he continued to human brotherhood and equality of opportunity for every man both at home and abroad but later on the pthiopian university campus where humphreys next speaking engagement was cancelled some students protested the vietnam war they carried a variety of placards from yankees pull out of vietnam to down with cia to is harlem in the free world to yankees stop abusing our sisters one sign proclaimed johnson has sent humphrey to prepare africa for mass butchery but ethiopia has tliis to saydown with the underhanded usa many of the placards demanded an american withdrawal from the kagnew communication base in ethiopia were not interested in words commented a young zambian government ofrcial were more intercsted in action we need help now zambia president kenneth kaimda yearold head of a nation landlocked by three whitesupremacist regimes was much more specific the only african leader to ask for and receive from humphrey a briefing on u s race relations kaimda said in his welcoming address south africa today is a boiling pot unless the usa can act a catastrophe of a racial nature and of an ideological nature is inevitable the unholy trio smith of southern rhodesia vorster of south africa and salazar of angola speak unfortunately in your name they purport to defend western values tliey purport to speak for the christian world they purport to speak for western civilization i dont agree with them hut i am afraid the many disgruntled millions are no longer interested in listening to our sympathies they are calling for action kaimdas appeal was especially relevant because of the many white americans temporarily living in africa with racial attitudes as bigoted as those of former colonial rulers in the ivory coast for example the u s ambassador failed to invite many negroes to an embassy dinner a lack of space was later offered as an excuse hut newsmen noticed many vacant seats in kenya not a negro on the embassy staff was invited to dinner negro staffers for u s agencies in other african countries complain of rampant discrimination in word and deed one diplomat claims some wliites tell africans that u s negroes are second class citizens of the united states and have no influence another staffer explains these people gave me the cold shoulder at first they told me i was an exslave and couldnt communicate with them i told them they were exvictims of colonialism so what is the difference are you going to be pawns in a global chess game or face up to facts of life eventually the people began to accept me as a brother while it is true that black africans and u s negroes share in a brotherhood of suffering understanding between them is hampered by the lack of adequate communications facilities in africa there is for example no unified allafrica news service most newspapers and magazines are governmentcontrolled news about u s negroes is limitedas in the american pressto fleeting stories of sensationalism and notoriety no negro magazine or newspaper operates an african bureau and few of the developments in africa are carried as regular fare in the u s negro press meanwhile there are continuing rumblings of discontent in afi ica over the low leels of health employment education and welfare for the masses this discontent is especially articulated by the students at colleges and universities and is related to the fact that some cent of africas people are under manv of africas elder statesmenliberias presi dent william v s tubman kenyas jomo kenyatta the ivory coasts felix houphouetboigny ethiopias emperor haile selassiewill pass off the scene the future stability of many african countries will depend on the abilities of younger leaders presently waiting in the wings in light of this vice president humphrey recommends a u s policy toward africa which is more oriented toward the younger generation among other things he calls for an expanded youth exchange program a stepping ip of peace corps activity and increased emphasis on iinpro ing education at all levels in frica the vice president feels the united states has little choice but to play an active role in africa he recalls all the african leaders i talked to indicated a strong desire for a united states presence and involvement in africa in addition he says i believe we shoidd more actively encourage the recruitment of american negroes for foreign ser ice in africa the presence in africa of qualified and responsible negro americans can perhaps do more than anything else to prove that we americans practice what we preach about equal opportunity for all ts wild crazy jacqueline peters says i as she dips her brush into a bottle of vivid purple ink with a few jiiick strokes she draws an exuberant flower then stops to ponder should the center be neon jdinkor canary yellow much as her actions sound like occupational therapy jackies designs are serious business for her troubles at the drawing board she earns upwards of a year in the competitive new york garment industry jackie peters designs help determine what women will be wearing next season for she is one of the top fabric stylists and colorists in the business and she is one of the few negro women to make it big on the creative end of the fashion world as chief stylist in charge of the design studio at h m kolbe a new york textiles firm jackie must combine fashion knowhow with a winning personality in order to impress the firms allimportant buyers william kolbe president of the company has encouraged jackie from the start to work directly with firms customers although jackie was nervous about the customers reactions to her as a negro when she came to kolbe three years ago she soon found they cared more about the quality of her work than her race like all fashion experts they were concerned about hue but only in her fabric designs bbi jenine collins spent a large portion of her childhood in the watts section of los angeles her motivation was strong strong enough so that she earned a college scholarship but bobbi had to wait for college she wanted to help her family first thats why she got a job right out of high school jack tenner a los angeles lawyer hired her as a legal secretary she worked for tenner for five years during that time he encouraged her to pursue a law career of her own she worked a full day every day often with overtime then she traveled some twenty miles to classes dinner waited till or and studying came after that or on lunch hours or weekends it took ten years but she earned her law degree in june early in her career she worked in the law department at paramount studios in she got the offer to join milton a rudin a specialist in entertainment law today bobbi jenine collins is one of three attorneys in the rudin law offices their client list includes some of the most famous names in show business and she is becoming an expert in a field which has many negro contributors but few negro lawyers j ackie didnt plan to become a top textile stylistshe fell into the lucrative field ironically enough through lack of opportunity she says negroes dont know too much about textiles and they dont think of it in terms of a job as for herself she had made up her mind as a teenager to become an art teacher when her father a train waiter moved his family to cambridge mass jackie began her training as a major in art education later she transferred to the chicago art institute tut i took those awful courses in art education and found them so dull i really couldnt stand it she says after three years at the institute off she went to paris to enroll in the esteemed chanihre sijndicale cvecole couture parisienue a fashion school run by paris couture houses she returned a year later to present herself as an aspiring fashion designer to vogue haqers bazaar and just about every fashion magazine i could think of her youthful ambitions were quickly deflated by a succession of hardhearted editors rejection followed rejection some because of race prejudice but more she feels because she was an inexperienced tyro tlicy were marvelous she recalls wistfully they all saw me but said they couldnt help me they kept saying to me you dont have any experience and i kept saying to them well how do you expect me to get any experience if no one will hire me tall willowy and hungry jackie turned to the department stores for a fashion illustrating job but they were looking for models one look at the showroom and jackie decided she couldnt cut it she admits i was too shy and you have to put up with so much in showroom modeling and if you cant take it with a smile its no good finally she did land a job as a display artist for stores and tlien went on to work as an illustrator in studios but after all her struggles to make it big as a fashion illustrator she found that drawing clothing designs wasnt her forte after all in the midst of disillusionment she remembered the advice vogues fashion editor had given her several years before i had gone in to show her my fashion illustrations and stuck in a comer of my portfolio were some fabric designs i had done she was impressed by them and said i should be a textile designer at that time i really didnt know what the textile field was all about her first textile studio job was rewarding enough to lead to bigger and better opportunities right up to her present position as kolbes chief stylist jackie works in many capacities for kolbe from creating and coloring the design to visiting the mill to check on strikeoffs the first samples of the print to come off the press she keeps up on the fashion outlook by attending fashion shows continually visiting chic dress boutiques and reading fashion journals she concerns herself most with the colors that go into the designs kolbe produees eaeh year the colors are vital she explains because if they are wrong then just forget it nobodys going to buy your line no matter how beautiful the patterns are but jackie really doesnt have to worry too much for since she took up pen and brush for kolbe fashion designers have been buying her textiles to the tune of million a year her flair and talent have earned her a certain fame among clothing professionals in

the howard universitytrained ycarold general surgeon said farewell to his patients and students at freedinens hospital in washington d c and went to vietnam as one of the american medical assns volunteer physicians why did he volunteer dr funderburk a tall handsome father rf three explains that his main reason was the appalling shortage of medicallytrained persons in nietnam there are only m native physicians in all of south vietnam of whom serve the armed forces exclusively which leaves the medical care of the countrys million civilians in tlic hands of only physicians dr funderburk had been exempt from military service during his medical training and he thought this would be a good way of using his special skills where they were most urgently needed initially his wife marilvm had some objections to his plans to sign up because of her concern for his safety but he persuaded her by pointing out that ama volunteers are sent only to areas which are relatively safe and that none of the doctors who have served dav terms under the lrogram so far has been injured officials at howard and freedmens cooperated by granting the v oung doctor leav e and his three partners promised to take care of his patients the ama handled all other details and in the early part of october dr funderburk along with colleagues was on his vvay the volunteers did not receive their assignments until

vietnamese doctors and five vietnamese interns he found the medical staff fairly adequate roughly comparable to that of a small u s hospital but he felt handicapped by the lack of refined diagnostic tools that are available to physicians in the states since cooperation between american and vietnamese personnel is being encouraged dr funderburk worked closely with the interns from the medical school in hue he found that cultural differences between the two nationalities sometimes created problems such as the nursing staffs habit of disappearing for threehour siestas each noon and their seeming lack of concern for the patients welfare the latter he attributed to different attitudes toward death while the former he suspected to be related to the vietnamese peoples low calorie intakeonly a day as compared to for americans the language barrier existed he said but was minimized by aidsupplied interpreters who assisted the american doctors day and night about per cent of the surgical patients in the hospital were war casualties and most of them claimed that the americans were responsible for their injuries obviously this was not alway so says dr funderburk but the patients said so because they thought they would get better care by the americans if they did he says he was unable to determine which side had inflicted particular injuries since he was unfamiliar with various types of weapons and their effect although he got to see a lot of misery and suffering during eight weeks in that wartorn country dr funderburks overall impression is largely favorable i wouldnt change those two months for any two months ive spent in medicine and surgery he declared after he returned safely to washington just before christmas h e is already number one in the national capitals municipal goveniment and yet walter e washington keeps driving himself maybe it is because he is the appointed head of the district of columbias reorganized government and he wants to prove to his voteless constituents that he is just as concerned about their problems as any elected official or maybe it is because the president of the united states made him personally responsible for bringing dc from wagon wheel government into the jet age whatever it is that makes the yearold commissioneror mayor as the president and headline writers prefer to call himrun it has not allowed him to slow down for one second since he officially took office last november he became known as washingtons walking mayor even before that during his lookandlisttmi tours of arious nciiiborhoocls in tlie cit a itchniriiu he picked up from m ayor john lindsa during nine months as new york city housing commissioner he established contact with incinbers ot the house and senate district committersan important part of liis job since they still maintain supreme control over district allairs he testifiel at hearings and conferred daily with the w hite house he nameel new top city officials as he began to streamline the istrict goernnunl he helel stall meetings anel press eemfertmkcs set up w ork groups of urban experts to solve the citys immediate anel longrange problems anel he appealed to arious community greups for active support he atteneleel luncluons elinners benefits social events of all sorts anel temk care of a thousand and one emergencies in between commented one washington paper he is like a man possessed and his wife dr bennetta washington who has an extremely busy schedule herself while trying to divide her time between her new duties as dcs first lady and her job as director of the womens job corps sighed sometimes i do wish he had the capacity to completely relax and forget about problems it would be wonderful if i could get him away to play a little bit sometimes but walter edward washingtonborn in dawson ga reared in jamestown ny and a washingtonian since he entered howard university in knew there would be little time for play when he gave up his ayear new york xost to become washingtons chief executive thoroughly familiar with the citys problems from his years with the national cajital housing authority he headed it from to he knew that the mandate to make washington a model city for the rest of the nation was practically impossible but as his wife puts it my husband is an optimist he had to be last year washingtons educational system was given a failing grade by a team of experts presently more than half of the public school students who start secondary school drop out before graduation the socalled passow report recommended a doubled budget vastly improved teaching facilities better teachers and improved administration as minimum requirements in order to give the students per cent of whom are black anything resembhng a proper education the housing situation is similarly dismal more than a quarter of a million washingtonians live in substandard housing and housing units will be needed in the next years tlie local crime rate keeps climbing frantically and is the highest of any city of similar size policecommunity relations are poor partly because the xolice force traditionally is predominantly white when mayor washmgton took office there was no negro above the rank of cajtain the health situation also leaves much to be desired washington has the highest infant mortality rate of any american city and air and water pollution constitute major health hazards the unemployment rate is comparatively low but there are at least persons who are employable but cannot find work and two or three times that many individuals are underemployed some xx residents receive some kind of public assistance and many more dont get needed help due to the stringent welfare rules set by congress most of these plights washington shares with other major urban areas but they are aggravated by the fact that washingtonians per cent of whom are negroes have no voice in their own goernment for the last years the citys affairs have been handled some say mishandled by southerndominated house and senate committees congress reportedly spends million and man hours each year serving as a city council for dc but the lawmakers naturally are more interested in the problems of their own constituents and the district is largely treated as an unwanted stepchild before last years reorganization dc agencies and departments were allowed to sprawl unchecked with waste and duplication of services as a result mayor washington often quotes the citys rat problem as typical of the situation washington has four kinds of rats he says commercial rats housing rats public housing rats and park ratsall handled by different departments such proliferation does not make for effective rat control and uncoordinated agencies coupled with outmoded codes and ordinances do not make for effective government but despite its handicaps washington dc is a city with potential the southern solons kmow it as well as black militants like stokely carmichael said carmichael when asked why he planned to settle in the federal capital after his long foreign odyssey this is our town baby well it isnt but it would be if truly democratic principles were applied to washington walter e washington may not buy stokelys brand of black_power but his appointment as single commissioner and the appointment of a negro majority city council for the district constituted at least a symbolic step toward representative government hopefully to be followed by complete home rule in the nottoodistant future both the mayor and the council members are on record as strong home rule supporters they know that the way in which they perform their duties delicately balancing between actiondemanding citizens and goslow lawmakers may speed or delay home nile few whites admit it publicly but every one knows that it is the southerners fear of a negro takeover that has kept selfgovernment away from the district for all these years there are signs however that attitudes are changing on capitol hill in addition to passing the presidents reorganization plan which replaced the former tliree district commissioners with one commissioner a deputy commissioner and a ninemember city council the th congress approved a proposal that will give dc citizens the right to elect a city school board moves are also under way to give the district representation both in the house and in the senate speculations as to who among the capitals vips will seek those choice public offices when they become available are already being voiced and denied so the colonial grip on the squaremile area and its residents is slowly loosening up among the few citizenship rights presently enjoyed by washingtonians is the right to vote in presidential elections and that only since though congress still holds the purse strings for the district and can undo by legislation what the council or the commissioner decides by ordinance mayor washington has a few things going for him that thadministrators under the threecommissioner system lacked first he has reorgaiiizational powers and the right to transfer funds from one department to another without congressional approval ilis fight against waste and duplication in the city government has barely started but there have been enough changes mainly in crime control and program coordination to indicate that the mayor means business a byproduct probably planned of the streamlining effort has been the definite increase of negroes in the upper echelons of the district government the mayor may not reach the goal set up by the washington committee for black_power at the senate hearings on his nominationto triple the number of black people in gs jobs and above within six monthsbut he wont be far off another important aspect of the new mayors potential is the fact that he has the presidents wholehearted support once lbj had picked walter e washingtonrecommended by lady bird johnson among others who knew him from their joint beautification efforts to lead the rehabilitation program he gave him the full backing of his administration washington was among the first cities selected by the department of housing and urban declopment for planning grants for the model cities program despite the fact that its original application reportedly was one of the worst received by hud when the grants were announced sect robert c weacr specifically pointed out that dc was included because of its recent change in government the federal government also provided nearly xk for the planning of an entire new community on federallyowned land in one part of the city with the promise of more than million later towards constniction costs federal funds were made available to meet emergencies when first the citys promising youth employment project pride inc and later an adult training program faced suspension due to lack of funds tlie citys major source of air pollution open trash burning at the kenilworth dump was eliminated thanks to a grant from the dept of health education and welfare the list goes on the mayors third advantage is his personal goodwill even those who were mentioned as possible candidates for the post before washingtons appointment was announced admit that he was the best man for the job mayor washington appreciates the support and goodwill he is getting but he does not confuse publicity with achievement going where the action is constitutes a start he says but knowing how to produce must follow he shrugs off uncle tom charges by militants with cannot be evervthing to everybody im basically an administrator who wants to administrate programs for the good of all the people business community as well as grassroots i like to be judged on performance and not on what somebody believes and he wishes that local groups making noise would come to him with programs suggestions and concerns so he can include them in his considerations and he wants more than oral reassurances from the groups and individuals supporting him i cant function with the kind of citizen who lats me on the shoulder and says go to it walter we are going into the fight together he told an audience recently most of the district of columbias problems are yet to be solved but mayor washingtons optimism is infectious and there is a new mood of hope and cxxectation in the nations capital because of him manhattan kan might be called a upical midwestern college commiiniu most of its white citizens earn a prosperous living working for kansas state university and most of the white youngsters there can hope to earn a college degree some day but it is an altogtther dillerent thing for the negro children of this small town thev still lie across the tracks in a neighborhood of shabby wooden bungalows and unpa ed streets few of them have ever been inside a college building it used to be that if black kids crossed the immaculate university campus white students turned to stare at these refugees from the black community but the eampus scene has been changing in the last two vears since a group of negro coeds decided to adopt some grammar school girls they hae formed a unique club called the kansas state community sisters to promote pride race consciousness and ambition among the young negro girls in manhattan the girls have established a warm relationship with their sisters and white students on the campus are getting used to seeing a happy sea of brown faces as the youngsters go out to explore the wonders of the other side of manhattan t he impetus for the community sisters began when mrs lonnie keith a phd candidate at kansas state struggled to teach a group of restless negro tots at a sunday school class most of the youngstrs lived in fatherless homes which their mothers ran with the help of monthly welfare checks they lived in a segregated community and knew little of the upsurge of black pride that is taking place across the country when one negro child said to her friend luann youre a black girl a hairpulling fight began the few negro college women at kansas state were shocked to hear some of the stories that drifted over from the ghetto these kids know more about life than we do one coed remarked the girls agreed with mrs keith that they might be able to provide a beneficial big sister image to youngsters who could point to few if any success stories in their own community in addition the club could provide an outlet for tlie students own loneliness outnumbered to in the university they felt like outsiders in many activities they were tired of the false welcomes received at wliite clubs and sororities because the community sisters would be the first allnegro selfhelp group both on campus and in manhattan the girls planned their club with unusual enthusiasm and when they introduced their idea to the negro immunity they found almost per cent support each girl soon acquired a small sistera child who desperately needed to develop pride in herself and her race and a child who had still to icani the social manners expected of a young lady t f y i he need for a social action ironp such as the community sistrs hecomes selfc idcut vhcu one trices to get manhattans negro youngsters to talk about their scliool their intctests or their hobbies most have ery little to say or show a disturbing lack of ambition said one tenyearold girl what do i want to ie when i grow up oh i dont knowmavbc ill be a maid like mv momma wl despite the need the coeds are not lored dogooders they readily admit they get as much pleasure from the club as do their little sisters one student confessed as she snappcd her fingers to th latest soul hit record how do you think i learned to do the funkv broadwav mv little sister taught me savs a mother who has lived in manhattan years the college girls are just wonderful i never knew half as much about the college as m little daughter does now maybe shell think about going to college but most of till youngsters have a long way to go before college as one student said first we have to shake off this attitude of defeat from these kids a fter two years interest in the community sisters has increased rather than diminished on both the campus and in the negro community the idea has spread for the coeds are finding that white students are developing concern for local negro children even to the point of establishing another big sisters club however negro coeds feel that theirs is a unique organization because they share a close rapport and warmth with their black sisters the negro student can understand the stigma of segregation and the racial inferiority complex that they found in the manhattan negro community the lasting enthusiasm among the negro students and the black community is due to the seemingly boundless pep and the efficiency of the clubs officers who plan the monthly eents these include a charm school session negro histor week lectures a tea planned by the little sisters for their mothers to show off newlylearned social graces and a talent show moneymaking efforts on campus such as a nictory party and a homecoming dance hae brought in enough funds to pay for a longawaited trip to historic abilene for the girls and their sisters they also hope to raise enough money to provide a scholarship for one of the youngsters to pay for individual public school fees in the town next in line on the chibs list of future goals is an infonnal recruitment program to interest black women on other college campuses in setting up similar sister clubs lready they have received some enquiries from coeds in nearby colleges t fiisttl membership is limited to college women the girls aoid promoting a university education for their sisters and setting themsebes up as ideal images of successful negro women says cynthia white secretary of the club we dont want our little sisters to think material success is evervthing vve dont want them to feel that they have to go to college or that they have to have a career to be happy we cant impose our morality on them and tell them what is right and wrong all of us know that our influence is necessarily limited but if we can just help them to become responsible citizens proud of their race and heritagethats enough their achievement of this goal is summed up by a mother of twelve my daughter nev er liked to do her chores around the house and she never had anything to do except hang around the social center with some of those teenage boys now if she knows her big sister is coming around she rushes to get ev erything done so she can go out with her the community sisters is a vvonderful clubweve never had anything like it before now i only wish that tlie college men would form something like it for the boys a lways on his desk and often tucked inside his briefcase when he traveled was a photograpli of a beautiful negro woman wearing the robes and wig of an english barrister negroes were tlie more frequent visitors at his mansion little venice in londons regents parkthe ones he would more likely ask to spend a weekend or several weeks if they liked he despised anyone he considered as racially prejudiced and avoided the presence of anyone he even suspected of being so the sight of an interracial couple walking arminarm along the thames ri er quais seemed to thrill him th sight of german browai babies abandoned and hungry in the streets of frankfurt made him sad this was peter ilaiw fuld a fabulously wealthy germancanadian businessman w ho did of brain cancer in frankfurt six years ago he was just years old but the fortune he left exceeded sis million and from his grae it seems he told the world just how bitterly he regretted never having married the negro woman whose photograph he ahvays kept nearby how he considered their broken engagement as his failure to meet the greatest challenge of his life for in his will peter fuld not only stipulated that a large part of his fortune was to go to the west indian girl lu had fallen in love with years ago she is now mrs ivy lawtcnce maynier of kingston jamaica but that more than million was to be used for the benefit of young people of colored origin in germany and other young peojle subject to racial discriminationthe kind of children that he and ivy might have had finally after more than five years of legal challenges in the british high courts of justice the peter fuld charity fund has been announced in london and young people of colored origin folds way of referring to children of negrowhite parntage will soon begin receiving scholarship grants housing assistance and benefits of other kinds administrator of the fund is a london attorney philip hartley who was folds business advisor and close friend mrs maynier is one of three persons on an advisory board the peter fuld story is a strange tragic one peters father hariy fuld was a frankfurt jew who made a fortune in the telecommunications industry after world war i the small firm that he began advertising by putting on a shiny top hat and walking around frank the telephone man is now the giant tcicfouhaii uml nonnalzeit company with branches and outlets around the world harry fuld died in when peter was just years immediately the little boy was a millionaire a year later however hitler began rising in germany and rising with him was his antijew campaign though his mother was real german and his father was dead peter was the nazis knew still halfjew frau ida fuld feared for her sons safety when he was she slipped him out of germany and sent him first to switzerland then to london to school when england was threatened in world war h peter was one of tliose aliens rounded up by british authorities and shipped off to internment camps in canada peter often recalled the experience to friends i had been playing tennis that day and the authorities were waiting for me when i came home they didnt e en allow me to pack a suilcasc i was placed aboard a ship and had to travel all the way to canada in my tennis shorts tliere were no beds for some of us so i slept on a table during the whole voyage it is something ill never forget while in internment peter lost contact with his mother and the nazis had meanwhile confiscated the familys business and wealth peter finally got out of internment under a special program which allowed jewish refugees to enter canadian schools he was accepted at the university of toronto and began studies for two degrees bachelor of arts and bachelor of law peter found his situation a difficult one he was not a practicing jew and this caused some resentment among other refugees he was however a german liing in canada and going to university there at a time when germans were hardly popular in the country thus his world at was one of nearisolation of very few friends one of the few people who bothered with him at all was ivy lawrence the negro girl he found seated next to him on his first day at school both had enrolled for law classes they began studying together after four or five months of friendship they had fallen in love during their university years ivy and peter were a campus couple they often walked together lunched together went to cinemas and museums they strolled in the canadian woods and discussed law and politics and the arts peter would say later that of all the girls he had known ivy was the only one whose personality matched his own they thought alike enjoyed tlie same things together the drafted the letters that peter sent to the international red cross and the quakers as he desperately tried to locate his mother during the war years soon peter began insisting that ivy learn german it was his intention he told her that they would be married and live in europe ill go back home to germany when the war is over he told her and then ill no longer be this wandering jew then he took a step that he felt would ensure his future he applied for canadian citizenship though ivys parents were both west indian she had been born in montreal and thus was a canadian citizen peter wanted them to have identical passports and when his finally came through they celebrated the event in both peter imd ivy graduated with highest honors in law peter returned immediately to london to continue the search for his mother and to hire a lawyerphilip h hartleyto help him reclaim the family business and establish his rights under his fathers will ivy arrived a few months later to read for her london bar exam they saw each other every day for a year and all tlic time discussed their wedding plans but meanwhile peter had not only found his mother but he cl had violent cpiarrcls with her over his plan to marry a negro girl so deadset was mrs fold against ivy lawrence that the old woman threatened suicide do it and til kill myself she warned peter was torn between love for ivy and the responsibility he felt for an aging mother who had lived through a terrible war disappointed i y left london took a legal research job in the west indies and didnt see peter for two years letters and telephone calls however kept their love alive ly began traveling between the caribbean and europe meeting peter in london or paris lunching with him in stuttgart or frankfurt this went on for six years and all that time peter continued quarreling with his mother about ivy and straightening out his business affairs he had finally won claim to some million and the fortune grew as telcfonbaii unci normalzeit grew in size though they had gone over drawings for a huge house in frankfurt had picked out furniture upholstery materials china and such things both peter and ivy knew by that mrs fuld would never agree to be the motherinlaw of a black girl ivy decided to withdraw from the relationship and make a serious attempt to lead my own life three years later she was married in canada to pierre gemma a professor it was a marriage that lasted only nine months peter tried marriage too and his also ended in divorce after more than years of courtship it seemed that neither iy nor peter could actually withdraw from the relationship and lead their own lives nevertheless old mrs fuld still lived and on march ivy became mrs earle anthony maynier wife of a west indies federal government official she had met and fallen in love with the peter fuldivy lawrence love affair no longer existed peter fuld became simply a good friend of the mayniers when maynier visited london on business he almost always saw peter fuld by the cancer that would eventually kill him began destroying peters brain the once brilliant extremely handsome man began lapsing into epilepsy began seeing a psychiatrist began dreading the brain surgery he knew he had to have two years later in march peter fuld was dead surgery had helped for a while but the cancer had recurred a letter that attorney hartley sent to ivy maynier told her only that proisions have been made for you in peters will details of the provisions came out when the will was challenged in courtchallenged by a stillbitter ida fuld and the psychiatrist who had treated peter for years both claimed that peter had written several codicils that drastically altered the original will since at least onesixth of peters estate was in england the british high courts of justice accepted jurisdiction and the resultant trial was the longest and costliest probate action in the history of english law it lasted days and involved trial lawyers and ehibits and witnesses from britain europe and merica more than three million words were recorded and trial costs figured out to for each hour that the court was in session the life of the trial judge lord scarman was insured for just in case he became ill or died during the hearings among the witnesses was mrs maynier who came from jamaica stayed in the witness box for days and talked about her relationship with peter fuld her testimony filled half a volume in the trial records when a judgment was finally rendered peters original will and a single codicil were allowed to stand with more than million involved onethird of the residuary estate after death duties trial costs etc went to old mrs fuld who still lies in gennany the remaining twothirds was distributed according to peters directions to several former fiancees including mrs maynier who was awarded percent to several friends and to hartley who was awarded percent mrs mayniers share was subject to a stipulation that she use percent for the furtherance of the teaching of law in the west indies as for hartleys share he must use percent for the benefit of young people of colored origin a trust provision results in all parties receiving only the income from their shares for a year period lump sums will accrue in all tlie details arent worked out yet says hartley but i know that well be interested in doing more for these children than simply providing shelter and schooling well probably want to get into a program of construction of apartments for mixed couples whose children suffer discrimination simply because one of the parents is colored well also want to consider the creation of apprenticeship programs for west indian youth here in london and perhaps in germany tooactually where er we find the kind of youngsters mentioned in mr folds will then there is the whole area of postschool training there arc endless jdossibilities you know and believe that peter would approve of what we intend to do mrs maynier who has built a new life in jamaica and who is now a member of the administrative staff of the university of the west indies is reluctant to talk about her past peter and i parted a long time ago but we always remained very good friends she says im proud of course to be a trustee of the fund and im hoping it will mostly be spent on children of mixed blood where the mother has not married what we must stress is that because of the year trust we have no large sums in our hands right now our plans are still subject to whatever happens in the german courts nevertheless a great number of children will some day benefit because of a mans regretsregrets that he as he often told his friends broke my engagement to the one woman i really loved and thus failed to meet the greatest challenge of my life h azel dorothy scott powell bcdin has in the span of what might still be considered a short lifetime been many things child prodigy darling of cafe society concert artist civil_rights pioneer the wife of a famous and powerful man mother divorcee expatriate the one thing that hazel scott as she is better known has not been is an enigma she is outspoken direct and in matters that deeply concern her definitely opinionated these qualities might be disagreeable in some people but since miss scott is also beautiful flamboyant and brilliantly talented one must consider her attitudes as part of the total woman miss scott arrives at her selfassuredness via a process too painful for most human beings to practice although many go through the motions once each seven years or so she undertakes a ruthless introspection and selfevaluation followed by a period of rejuvenation she is currently undergoing such a rejuvenation and the results are somewhat dramatic they involve for instance the relocation of her home base from paris to the united states and the shedding of some to excess pounds today in a white ratpatrol hat black thighhigh boots and striped poncho the great scott beauty makes for a dashing appearance but she arrived at this state only after a personal ordeal at the cannes film festival of hazel scott was down to what she calls not inaccurately my fighting weight which ranges between pounds but then strange things began to happen one was physical i had a couple of times when i just keeled over without knowing what was wrong she explains and i became tired all the time i had mononucleosis and didnt know it mononucleosis is marked by the presence of an cxccssixc numlr of wliilc blood cells with a sinjlc nucleus to combat miss scotts siege a doctor ga e her massi itamin shots iht second problem to confront her concurrently with her illness was psschological in what she now considers to be a momentary mental lapse on her part she set out to make herself undesirable as she puts it at the moment i am a woman alone bv choice its kind of a strange thing for me to ailmit for attention from the opposite sex is always llattcring but theres a point benond which it becomes ollensive particularly from somebody who is unaltracti i to voii soon she found herself doing the psychological eating deliberately making myself unattractie which is stupid and shortsighted because then the person who is attractive to you is not attracted by you that is the hangup of all times recovcin from the mononucleosis took six months its a bore more than ain thing else miss scott declares because you simply cant do anything you get up in the morning feeling great and by the time you ha e your bath and get dressed you fall right on your face you cant practice you cant xercise you cant do anything but the itaniin shots had added fuel to the fat so to sptak and before her ordeal was over the entertainer had gained pounds within thrtc months she shed of them just protein she explains im a bug on the question of protein as opposcd to carbohydrates and fats which were cut coinphtely from the diet miss scott who describes herself as totally undisciplined as to meal time except when she is a homemaker usually skipped breakfast ate wikmi she felt like it and stuck rigidly to her diet not onlv did she lose the excess weight but she experienced no distasteful side effexts and had more energy than ive ever had the return of hazel scott to u s shores after nearly full years abroad is a somewhat more complex story and centers around the old love for a good fight plus the request of her son adam clayton powell iii whose father is the selfexiled new york congressman whatever the reason for her return there were people glad to have her here many people are taking credit for it miss scott says of her homecoming including othr performers some suggested and miss scott now agrees that show business usa is the only place for a dedicated entertainment artist to be others pointed out the increasing tempo of civil_rights activity in this country and counseled that her past performances in that arena made her presence on the scene again necessary but i really came back miss scott admits because my son sent for me he said cjuite she does consider his feelings in the matter is indicativ e of her continuing esteem for powell adam did not want the divorce as he will tell anyone miss scott declares i was the one who walked awa it was unfortunate i admit that todaythat did because all things having come to light as they have it is unfortunate that i was not more mature and more helpful to him at the time and that i insisted on getting the divorce i should have been a little stronger and a little older in the head and not quite so c hildlike miss scott usuallv refuses to discuss powcll when she is being interviewed and on those rare occasions when she does venture an observation it is nev er critical her explanation is this too many women hav e children with a man and then completely forget that they are his children ecpially and precede to attack and villify him i think it is a painful horrible shocking process if i had my vvay i would have pictures of anyone who talked badly about someone they had been intimate with simply one of my parents has to be in this country since young adams father had repaired to the island of bimini to seek relief from the slings and arrows of unfavorable lawsuits and congressional action miss scott remained the logical choice she also seems to be the logical choice in the minds of many people for questions concerning her exhusbands imbroglios it is evident that the povvellscott link has survived six years of divorce and her second marriage in to ezio bedin a handsome young italiansvviss entertainer from whom she is now divorced miss scott is still haunted by people who declare that you and adam belong to each other she feels that such remarks must be as embarrassing to her first husband as they are to her and the fact that shown on a large screenin the most intimate positionreminding them that they once cared so i vvoidd never attack mv sons father even if i hated him which i do not i dont even dislike him i happen to be deeply fond of adam and while what we once had is no longer still think it was great were much better friends todav than when we were married this sort of discussion leads one rathef naturally to another cpiestion since miss scott is still an attractive woman at i dont believe i shotthl marry again miss scott admits when she thinks about the question if i did i suppose it vvoidd be because of the demands that societv places upon you all things being equal once you become a mother youre never your own person again unless you are prepartxl to get thee to a nunnery you have to consider that perhaps v oull marry again someday but let us say that dont wish it upon anv poor soul both adam and ezio had a case because i can be extremely difficult but it can be fun living with me i am quite fortunate that both men who have been married to me have nothing but good things to say about me to what does she attribute this example of male loyalty ive always tried to be fair in my dealings with other people says hazel especially husbands miss scott definitely has something on her mind other than future romantic entanglements at this time and that something is what appears to her to be the appalling state of race relations in this country i have to stay here now she declares its not just a question of career its more than that its a question of whats happening here i see this creeping horror and what happened in the cities last summer is not what i am talking about what miss scott is talking about is a certain open hostility she now senses in northern communities where it was once latent and a amtinuing cruelty involving negroes in the south in her view the present negro movement is too divided for maximum effectiveness in her desire to see more unity in the negro social revolution miss scott believes that taetics must be determined by the eventual goals says she it boils dowm to this what are we going to finally do are we just going to say that blood must mn in the streets whose blood and why does that mean the blood of anyone who happens to be standing in your path somebody who might have something in his hand to help you are you going to spill his blood and let your enemy live well in that case i cant go along with it im sorry i must think before black people and white people are killed in the streets i want to know what they are dying for tlie entertainers credentials for such observations on the civil_rights scene are impressive as a concert artist of the s she had a clause in her contract which called for a promoter to have to forfeit half of her minimum guarantee without her being required to perform if the audience was segregated in any way wticn miss scott later signed with another booking agency the clause was dropped but her new management assured her none of its representatives would ever book her into a segregated house one slipup was made however at the universiw of texas at austin when she arrived to find that the gregory gymnasium which had sold out its seats plus standing room had a red carpet going down the middle to separate negroes from whites she did not go on and invited school officials to sue her they declined but the story made newspapers around the country in addition to her pioneering in the fight against segregated southern audiences miss scott was among the first to wear her hair in something simulating a natural state and she has some comments not all of them flattering upon the current trend among negroes today i have a deep and abiding resentment for the socalled new negro because i think he has been a little late in arriving number one she says firmly number two id like to know where were theyand theyre going to say they werent bom but their parents were here years ago when i put myself out of work when i was called among some of the kinder things a black joan of arc a communist and radical a professional black lady and an apologist for my race i was told that i waved my color like a banner i am not about to sit still now and let anybody tell me that nothing was done until these new negroes started letting their hair grow long i didnt wear my hair in its natural state that is to say combed high and with combs and various costumes because i was angry about being black i did it because i thought it was beautiful and i still do but if somebody is going around wearing a large scowl to go with the hairdo as a badge proclaiming i have this hair and i am better than you then they are quite wrong there are a great many negroes who will never be able to have what is known as a natural because their hair is just not nappy enough lets not go in the other direction and become reverse snobs miss scott was not out of touch with the racial situation in the united states while she was in europe in fact a march on the american embassy in france to coincide with the march on washington was organized from her paris bedroom she was laid up with a broken hand when writer james baldwin actor bill marshall and photographer richard aveclon came to talk to ikt about some sort of sympathy demonstration hazel enlisted actor anthony quinn in the project and later she marched with her arm in a sling miss scott attributes part of her own concern with blackness to the fact that her family always knew from which tribe they came we are yoruba she states her maternal greatgrandfather she explains was actually a tribal witchdoctor so you see this sudden identification by others with africa while gratifying is not particularly impressive to me because i have always identified with africa she has further identified with the racial problems in this country from the age of four when she was deliberately pushed into a new york subway excavation by a white playmate her aunt called the child a little white murderess a year or so later hazel was with her father an intellectual black nationalist who spoke chinese dialects attending a marcus garvey lecture i remember he was a magnificent man in a black uniform with gold epaulets says hazel gar cy was cxctaiming that he was a man an announcement which prompted the young girl to ask her father if tlie remark was not unnecessary since anyone could see he was a man i remember my fathers eyes filling with tears as he told me hazel recalls thats just it my child im afraid there are people who cannot see that he is a man to further hazels understanding her mother purchased large cakes of brown soap to help scrub the tenement homes of their neighbors because she believed as many of us who are clean there are that many of us to refute the lie today hazel scott feels that the lie still must be refuted and she appeals to todays youth to join in says she of the flower children this is not the time to head for the bar or to sit in the corner and pull your curtains around you and say im going to turn on and tune in and drop out you cant drop out of whats happening you can close your eyes and your ears but its going on all around you and youll find yourself wasted sitting in your comer and wont even know what hit you the psychedelic drug is not the answer what is needed here as painful as it may be is a little awareness of whats happening for hazel scott is truly ready to play her part in the action o rgwizing parties used to be a favorite hobby of gene hovis a handsome yearold actor now it has become the wav he makes his livingand a very interesting living it is as general manager of arthur new york citys most in discotheque he serves as host to the hordes of swingers that consistently cram the plush east side club famous for the number of celebrities it attracts any night of the week gene might be seen in the clubs intimate pub room chatting with people like lena horne angela lansbury frank sinatra or roddy mcdowell or he might be picking his way through the knots of wriggling and writhing dancers in arthurs larger discotheque room where earshattering live rock music alternates with deafening recorded sounds in between hs likely to be busy tending to patrons problems checking out the menu pacifying the long lines waiting outside for admittance or overseeing the staff of nearly people that is gene hovis at night during the day liis tasks are less glamorous for everything must be prepared for evening says gene you can come in and never know where i might be sometimes i might be sitting at the cash register sometimes behind the bar or playing records you might find me on the ladder with a paint brush or you might even see me with the acuum but at night all these odd jobs gi e way to his main function which is making certain that everyone who visits arthur has a good time from the famous to the ordinary folks who also come everything that happens at arthur involves gene who moved up last year from his old jobs as wine steward and later day manager of the thriing threeyearold club it also invohes sybil burton christopher the former actress from wales who conceixed the idea for the club and still helps run it sybil and gene work well together because they think alike on a lot of things from interior decoration to menu jlans however their partnership exceeds the more common business matters running the club with energetic sybil means that gene must accompany her on shopping trips visits to art galleries and even parties we try to keep up with whats happening gene notes with a place like arthur you really have to keep up with the times t he glamorous world exemplified by arthur was not cxactly alien to gene hovis before he joined the staff of the club two years ago after graduating from high school in his hometown of salisbury n c he migrated to new york to try his luck as an actor eventually he wound up throwing coconuts around in jamaica he also did commercials modeling and bit parts in movies and tried all the things that one normally does to try and make a successful theatrical career but he wanted something more secure an opportunity to change his course came when he heard about an opening for a wine steward at arthur gene knew many of the people who had been involved in the backing of the novel club which was founded with contributions of each from investors including julie andrews rex harrison sammy davis jr mike nichols leonard bernstein baby jane holzer and many other familiar show business figures since he was between shows gene decided to take the job he says i had a knowledge of food and wines that i had gotten from traveling and from reading he also had gained a reputation as a good cook and party organizer it wasnt long before the directors of arthur noticed his talents and moed him up from wine steward to day manager then general manager now he is the very popular man in charge its a series of many things and many jobs that like to do says gene mostly like meeting people being involved with food and making others happy for doing what he likes gene makes a comfortable yearly salary and as a bachelor lives well he has no immediate plans for marriage stating i have such a full life it seems that im almost married to my job and the people here my job is ery demanding genes move to arthur also was a good one in the eyes of sybil christopher who readily admits vvhereer gene goes on behalf of arthur he leaves a fantastic impression hes so nice to everybody just everybody its incredible he ne er seems to lose his temper hes kind to a fault too kind almost the fact that he is a negro had little to do with his getting the job according to gene theyve just gien me a chance to have my own way with the whole club to show that i have the abilitv to run it located as it is on manhattans plush east side arthur has had some difficulty in attracting negro patrons once it was charged with discrimination though the case proed baseless when brought to court even gene admits not as many negroes as i would like to see come to arthur i feel there has been so much trouble in the past that it has left a bad taste in the mouths of people new yorks night life is still a bit prejudiced but at arthur were not and wed like to see more negroes here when gene first came to arthur he recalls that there were no negroes dancing at the club later a few including bigname stars started coming and now gene states i think at least e ery night you can find some negroes in arthur as for gene arthur has become just about his entire life except for taking art courses at new york university colleeting antiques and taking piano lessons he even tends to entertain his friends at the discotheque though many of the influential people who frequent the club have offered him other jobs he has no plans for leaving says gene wliy should i i love arthur and it has become a part of me i no f most black athletes have their way about it and if transportation to mexico city keeps on sailing rolling and flying therell be no largescale boycott of the olympics only one per cent of athletes polled by ebony agree with the boycott proposal which came out of a black youth conference in los angeles last november another per cent say they are undecided but a massive per cent reject the idea outright some dont like what they think is an infringement of their right to individiml rather than group thinking some worry about their economic futures as career athletes others object that they were not even consulted before the boycott proposal was announced still others see the olympics as the athletic ccnt of a lifetime an e ervfuiirthvear workrs fair of physical prowess for which per cent of all olympians qualify only once so olympic hopefuls while generally agreeing with the boycott s goals o erwhelminuk turn clown the proposal which is heing piislu cl by san jose state college sociology prof harry edwards boycott the olympics miss joining ot the world s greatcst athletcs in procession around mexico citys brand luw estadio olimpico not hear the sound of ole and hurrah welling up irom soooo throats when perhaps a gold medal is won or a prize is sharcd though edwards is a former diseus thrower and college baskctball team captain it must seem to many that hes just an ivory towertype who knows nothing about the world of sports and the thrill of ictory and public adulation that he has for some reason hurled all pounds of his six feet eiglit inches full in the face of common sense edwards has however a givat many supporters the boycott idea has leen received caithusiastieally by most of the nearly delegates at the black youth conference theyre supporting it and talking it up all across the countrv theyre making speeches about it sending out literature about it collaring athletes and demanding where do you stand support also comes from dr martin_luther_king from floyd mckissick of core from ron karenga leader of us a los ngelesbascd black nationalistic group and from scores of lesserknown militants t the core of the proposal is the contention that the united states is a racist conntrv that its racism spills over into sports and that thus black athletes ought not participate in w inning international honors for a country in which they are oppressed not since a furor over nazi efforts to bar jewish athletes from german teams has the question of racism and sports been so dramatically posed edwards and his newly established olympic committee for human rights arc making at least six demands that society and the sports world restore muhammad alls title and license to box in the u s oust avery brundage president of the international olympic committee end the participation of allwhite teams from south africa and rhodesia in olympic and u s meets appoint an additional negro as an olympic coach appoint a negro to the united states olympic committee and desegregate the new york athletic club are these wild demands mere buckshot aimed at targets in outer space usoc president art lentz apparently thinks so edwards is now doing some homework and is beginning to see we cant meet these demands he claims expounding on only four of them he explains that the world boxing assn which took alis title is not connected with usoc administration that brundage was elected to his post by more than nations that usoc board members are elected by such member organizations as the national collegiate athletic assn the national assn of intercollegiate athletics and the amateur athletic union and that charges against the new york athletic clubwhich has not had negro or jewish athletes on its teams in this centurymust be dealt with directly we have no connection with tliem lentz argues linking of olympics and racism occurred before olympics when hurdler hayes jones anchored relay team wiuch carried detroits olympic torch from los angeles only to be met by civil_rights pickets but edwards is unmoved by such arguments these demands are just he declares how can they excuse having one black coach whose sole job is to pacify the black athletes and how can they excuse having a president of an international olympic committee who owns an exclusive lilywhite club one wing of which is olympic club west where most of the olympic committee business takes place the club has a few token jewshonorary christiansand no negroes avery brundage runs a segregated racist organization brundage an yearold retired engineering consultant has been associated with the olympic power stnicture for years as usoc head in he reportedly praised germany under hitler in an address before a german day rally at new yorks madison square garden in he allegedly threatened to expel kenyan athletes from the olympics after they prottsted against south africas lilywhite entries today the ioc president claims he concerns himself only with the international aspects of athletics and therefore is somewhat removed from the problems of this thing the boycott and the political problems of the world a magazine reporter once quoted millionaire brundage as saying he would sell his exclusive montecito country club in santa barbara calif before letting niggers and kikes become members but brundage claims now the charges against me are monstrous lies that isto be precisehe denies he had used such impolite words as niggers and kikes as for the clubs policy well you must remember that its a private social club run by committees he says i only own the property and facilities i belong of course but i dont serve on those committees and if they choose to accept only redhaired barbers for members i think its their right is brundage a racist you can quote me on this he says defensively i think there should be a qualified negro on the usoc board i think jesse owens is a fine boy the exolympic great is a yearold partner in a chicago public relations firm and might make a good representative but you must remember that all must be done according to rules and regulations i dont know how to suggest going about it i dont have usoc dealings at those levels anymore while brundage in effect declares himself aloof to prospects of an olympic boycott new york times syndicated sports writer art daley predicts a lilywhite team will gain fewer gold medals but the difference will not be appreciable yet in the six olympics since world war ii black athletes won per cent of the us track and field gold medals and is per cent of the nations total gold medals for all sports if you take the national scoring approach the us definitely would be hurt by a boycott admits dick drake managing editor of track and field news the us should garner medals if this country sent its best team of that count negro athletes would account for medalsor per cent by my calculations the us would lose a net of should the negroes boycott for caucasian athletes could make up for only three of the negroes have been especially important in the sprints the hurdles the relays and the high jump triple jump and long jump drake explains i think theyd be hardest to replace in the running events not the field events he predicts like drake usoc public relations officer bob paul calculates that an allout olympic boycott could be effective we know there are influential people white organizations with big money behind this thing he says he anticipates the boycott movement will snowball before the olympics next october both paul and stanley v wright the only negro on the nations fiveman olympic track and field coaching staff charge that threatening letters have been sent to at least four female members of tennessee a is famous tigerbelles i know coach ed temple at a i wont admit it says wright who coaches track at western illinois university but ive seen copies temple flatly denies knowledge of any such letters and edwards insists his olympic committee for human rights has not threatened anyone i dont believe in castigating people who dont go along with us he declares nevertheless wright claims be too has received threatening letters one writer whose name the coach refuses to reveal allegedly called him a dirty sob and an uncle tom and asked him to resign does wright plan to miss mexico city i dont respond to pressure like that he says meanwhile coach temple broods over the proposed boycott there are white folks who wont mind seeing negro boys and girls passing up all those medals he points out down in this part of the country theyve got a white boy named richmond flowers son of alabamas attorney general right now hes the white hope of the yard dash something happens every time he goes out tliere with my boy willie davenport and those other negro boys tommie smith and lee evans now i really dont know just what that something is but flowers always comes in second or third in races with negroes but he just might win the meter race in the olympics without those black boys down there with him right now hes behind thembut only a fraction of a second behind coach temple in effect suggests that instead of disarming racists an olympic boycott would give them aid and comfort some boycott critics like sports writer red smith even go so far as to claim the olympics have been the negros best friend if so whatever happened to howard drew and alice coachman this question is raised by baltimore afroamerican sports columnist sam lacy miss coachman was a star sprinter in the london olympics he recalls drew was a sprinter and broad jumper on the us team which went to stockholm in both now have dropped out of sight and earshot so have cornelius johnson ed gordon jimmy luvalle eddie tolan and archie williams to name a few olympians enjoy a place in the sun so long as it means glory for themselves and the u s lacy obser es but after a few weeks of eating high on the hog they fade into obscurity more to the point negro olympians do not become congressmen like bob mathias exdecathlon champ or corporation presidents like bob richards expole vault champ or even olympic committee members harry edwards argues even if they go into professional athletics they fall into a quota system ironically such professional sports as major league baseball football and basketball are among the most integrated activities on the american scene but even here where black men have more than proved their worth they still have a place that place is on the playing field there are only a few black professional coaches including footballs roosevelt brown and emlen tunnel baseballs junior gilliam basketballs bill russell no black managers and no black men in the front officcs of major teams black men can be the entertainers but not the entrepreneurs and empire builders of sports there can be black participation but not black_powerthe nittygritty of genuine integration and so likewise black_power is forbidden in the much deadlier games played in the larger and often surrealistic arena of american race relations as edwards sees it black olympic hopefuls can make their greatest contribution by not competing symbolically they would exchange bronze medals for decent jobs for black men silver medals for quality education for black children gold medals for adequate medical care in the ghetto they would give up recordbook fame so that black people might have the power to help make the decisions which detennine their destinies but most olympic hopefuls dont share edwards point of iew i think a boycott would be more detrimental to the negros cause because there is less discrimination in athletics says yearold ohio university sprinter emmett taylor willie whiite the yearold chicago sprinter who is preparing for her third olympic competition says i cant see passing up the olympics i am an athlete adds yearold high jumper steve brown of the university of idaho i woidd give almost anything to take part in this great event my main objective in high jumping is to be one of those americans who could represent the united states in the olympics i have waited quite a while for this opportunity edwards addresses his boycott proposal not so much to the olympics as to what he calls the survival of society what value is it to a black man to win a medal if he returns to be relegated to the hell of harlem he asks and what does society gain by some negro winning a medal while other negroes back home arc burning down the country its time for the auction block to come down black masculinity is no longer for sale the boycott is very necessary concludes dr charles v hamilton the political scientist at chicagos roosevelt university who with stokely carmichael coauthored the recently published black_power the politics of liberation it gives us another way of confronting the system of racism in this country im not concerned with nitpicking about its effectiveness or whether it is the best tactic or whether it should be done at or oclock this afternoon what black_power people are saying is that those of us who have made it star athletes or whatever have a responsibility to bring all our people along with us the boycott expresses our concern for the plight of most of our people in this country and it gives the problem international visibility t he biggest story in medical science in the past decade and perhaps the most dramatic in medical histoiy broke just three months ago in cape town south africa a man medical team headed by dr christiaan neethling barnard successfully transplanted the healthy heart of denise darval a yearold white bank clerk into the chest of louis vashkansky a yearold jewish grocer doomed to death because of a diseased heart miss daiwal had died in a traffic accident and her heart had been kept alive to pump blood through the veins of washkansky after a sevenhour operation scientifically the fact that wishkansky died days later of pneumonia is of little consequence the operation was a success for until the very last the transplanted heart was beating strongly dr barnards dramatic success touched off a small raft of heart transplantsthree in the united states and a second one by the barnard team at groote schuur hospital in cape town two in new york were failures but in california a heart operation succeeded although the patient later died of other causes of science and society d r barnards second and to date most successful heart transplant made more than medical news in blatantly racist south africa dr barnard transplanted the heart of colored clive haupt into the body of white jewish retired dentist dr philip blaiberg in the society of south africa racial lines are strongly drawn with the population split into four racial classes white indian colored and bantu black tlie whites are the bosses the indians the shopkeepers the coloreds the service workers and laborers and the blacks the heavy laborers and the servants clive haupt was a cape colored one of tlie more than million mixed blood residents of south africa who once enjoyed some priileges including exemption from paying poll taxes under the apartheid laws of the country but who now are more privileged than the blacks only in that they find it a little easier to obtain employment inteniational publicity on the coloreds reached the greatest height in the s when the scientific south african government literally went through the colored population with a fine toothed comb because it seemed that some black africanlooking citizens were cariying identification cards which showed that they were coloreds a goernment official would tiy to run a comb through the hair of a person professing to be colored see picture on opposite page and if the comb ran through easily the citizen was allowed to keep his colored rating if it encountered naps the citizen was classified bantueven if his sisters and brothers remained classified as coloreds a short article hair test for negroes was published in eboxy in april telling of the trials and tribulations brought on the coloreds by the government at that time today the hair tests are no longer conducted the government sohed its problem by taking away practically all of the coloreds privileges and treating them like their black bantu brothers a new breed of afrikaaners r barnard must belong to a new breed of afrikaaners the white descendants of the early dutch settlers of south africa perhaps it is because as a scientist and doctor he knows that there is basically little difference letween whites and blacks physically once you get beneath the exterior features dr barnard knew that philip blaiberg had type b rhpositive blood which is relatively rare haupts blood type was the same barnards pathologists found that haupts white cells were a good match for those of blaiberg blaiberg and haupt were brothers under the skin and when blaiberg said that he did not mind accepting a heart from a colored donor the operation was performed the telltale heart f dr blaiberg completely recovers and again walks the streets of cape town a most ironic situation will ensue clive haupts heart will ride in the uncrowded train coaches marked for whites onlv instead of in the crowded ones reseived for blacks it will pump extra hard to circulate the blood needed for a game of tennis where the only blacks are those who might pull heavy rollers to smooth the courts it will enter fine restaurants attend theaters and concerts and live in a decent home instead of in the tough slums where haupt grew up haupts heart will go literally to hundreds of places where haupt himself could not go because his skin was a little darker than tliat of blaiberg a good omen erhaps the fact that clive haupts colored heart worked successfully in white philip blaiberg will turn out to be a good omen even in racist south africa it will become just a little more difficult for whites to believe that whites and blacks are so radically different since their vital organs can be exchanged so readily the fact that haupts widowed mother in a time of great grief could have the compassion for a white man doomed to death by a diseased heart to give permission for the heart transplant must in some way have an effect on the most callous follower of apartheid the plight of haupts widow just three months earlier a bride should tug at the heartstrings of white south africans and make them realize that whether one is white black or colored one faces a life that can be happy and promising at one moment and a tragedy the next the plight of the blaibergs and the haupts should show how much all humans have in common it probably wont be so t is doubtful though that the transplant of a colored heart into a white man will have any positive effect upon the rigidly segregated life of south africa if anything it might even widen the gap now that it is known that doctors will transplant vital organs across the color line it may not be too long before the government will take steps to halt the practice it could do this by insisting that blacks and coloreds be treated only in black hospitalsnot in segregated sections of white hospitals if the donor and receiver cannot be brought together in the same hospital it will be impossible to perform the transplant operations and the blacks and coloreds themselves may put a crimp in the practice many black people today in both the united states and south africa fear hospitals because they believe that white doctors use black patients only for experimentation relatives of the hopelessly ill may refuse to give permission for transplants because they believe that to do so will only cause the doctor to hurry a death in order to complete a transplant its a morbid thought but nevertheless it is one that will cross the minds of many black people unfortunately dr barnards marvelous heart transplants may well turn out to be just another proof that science has far outstripped sociology we cant hold science back now it is time that humanity caught up with it f ew people ever remember the kinds of hors dbeiutes served at cocktail ixarties the bits of meat cheese or fish usually placed haphazardly on crackers or bread seldom are outstanding their chief function being to help absorb the more appreciated liquor much different though are the products of a sandyhaired pittsburgh grandmother hors doeuvres by roberta are so tasty and attractive that they have won repute on their own and have enabled their creator to build a thriving little business last june when mrs roberta bailey lewis opened her shop with the aid of a loan from the small business administration word of her delicacies began to spread and business began to boom today her biggest customer is allegheny airlines which buys an average hors doeuvres a month to be served on snack and cocktail hour flights terms of her contract are exclusivethat is she can not sell her hors doeuvres to other airlines servicing the same routes as allegheny so far the arrangement has been a success says charles a caldwell allegheny inflight service manager we are very pleased with them irimarily because of their uniqueness the reaction from the passengers has been veiy enthusiastic other customers eagerly purchase the remainder of the monthly hors doeuvres output of mrs lewis and her staff of they are sold in the gourmet shop of kaufmanns department store in pittsburgh and on a retail basis currently mrs lewis is negotiating with a major new york food brokerage firm and hopes that eventually her creations will be available in gourmet shops throughout the nation her specialties include hot hors doeuvres of chicken liver wrapped in bacon swedish meatballs barbecued beef tips cranberry muffins topped with sausage and wienersintheblanket her colorful hors doeuvre pies are tinted green pink or yellow and consist of tuna fish chicken or ham salad topped with sliced kumquats tiny ears of pickled corn which are eaten cob and all sliced olives norwegian sardines caviar and pickled beets a box of robertas ald hors doeuvres contains tiny salmon croquettes horseradish cakes made with beef turkey and chicken treats and shapely little sandwiches topped with olives cheese meat and spices her sweets include such delicacies as rum balls tripledecker brownies and fruitcake for which she is famous for mrs lewis having a shop of her oti has been the dream of a lifetime but businesses are not built on mere dreams and she had to pay her share of dues c l hapsgood who processed her loan through the pittsburgh sba recalls what impressed us about mrs lewis was the way she worked so hard to advance herself she had spent years perfecting her product and trying to get it on the market mrs lewis first went to work as a cook at the age of earning a week from an employer whom she had convinced that she was later she became a caterer for some of pittsburghs most fashionable clubs hotels and families she remembers catering parties for actresses janet blair and joan fontaine and for saks fifth avenue she still accepts some catering jobs but they are a very small part of her activities because of her busy schedule at the shop well known throughout western pennsylvania mrs lewis has given demonstrations of her work at food shows has spoken to womens clubs and has been featured as a food expert in a television commercial last summer she gave two months of her time without pay as a poverty program volunteer and trained women in the catering business three of them are now working for her and the others have catering jobs though mrs lewis works hours a day and has not yet reached the point where she can draw a salary she still finds time to enjoy a family life her husband thomas is a shipping and receiving clerk for the automatic canteen company of america they have four children and five grandchildren acknowledging the support she has received from her family she fondly explains i wouldnt have been able to accomplish this without their help like many professional cooks mrs lewis prefers seeing others enjoy her food over eating it herself my favorite foods are hot dogs and tv dinners she quips its business not eating that i like if i lived alone i would never cook at all b efore january the locals in houston tex didnt mind boasting that the astrodome their truly out of sight stadium was the eighth wonder of the world since that date they havent been so sure for that was the night when something happened in the astrodome that even houstonians had only dared imagine the university of houston cougars knocked off unbeatable ucla to in what was originally booked as a basketball gamebut turned out to be a world event ucl iin aded houston with a winning streak of games and a tall playera real tall ila erwhom people had been talking about so much that it seemed like hed been playing major college basketball years instead of two lew almgircindor all houston had was a damn good team ranked second in the nation and a louisiana import they called the big e who stands a mere and all he did was outscore and outrebound alcindor block his shots like nobody was ever supposed to do and outdo the real tall man at everything one might do on a basketball court can an imposing hunk of steel and glass really be considered more wondrous than such a human being elvin hayes was just trying to make a name for myself and he went out of his way doing it thirtynine points to alclndors netting out of field goal attempts rebounds to alcindors and sinking two winning free throws with the score tied at was the way it went dowm after the game which was viewed by some fans in person more than twice as many as had ever attended a college basketball game anywhere and millions more on tv an interviewer asked houston coach guy lewis what he thought about hayes the coach answered with a question of his own isnt he tremendous you better know it four years ago uh decided that winning athletic teams were more hip than uhjwhite teamsa course no doubt inspired to some extent by the schools having become a state institution about that time coach lewis received a tip on a stringy boy named hayes over in tiny rayville la he became the first black athlete to accept a scholarship to the university of houston i cant say i was instrumental in the decision to recruit negro athletes diawls lewis cause if id really been instrumental wed have had them long before we did he neednt remind you that it was rather frustrating to coach against the likes of oscar robertson as he once did with no black_power of his own but all thats changed because elvin hayes wasnt content to stay around rayville when elvin finished tossing buckets for britton high school the home folk expected him to remain in the area after all two of his sisters had attended southern university and his high school coach was a grambling grad and they were turning out boss athletes at those two black louisiana schools long before they ever heard of integration the folks told elvin that he would be used at the university of houston they said that the people at houston would only accept me as a basketball player not as a person there were incidentsthe familiar name calling that omnipresent ith century white waitress who perhaps will never diebut none of them could interfere with elvins showing his stuff and taking advantage of what he considered to be an opportunity the sportswriters say that the fans love the big e in houston and he returns all the smiles but deluded he is not talking brothertobrother he confides man you know im not fooled by all this he knows how things could be if elvin hayes had been just another black man maybe one just they really think a lot of me now says elvin about the folks in bayville theyre proud and real happy for me and no ones any prouder than his mom mrs savannah hayes why shes so proud she probably wont even object to her sons playing basketball on sunday when he turns pro next year she wouldnt allow him to play on sunday during those years when he was developing his talent but he took advantage of the other six days from morning until bedtime his father christopher hayes died five years ago when elvin was as a boiler inspector he managed to put five children in college three of whom took degrees elvins brothers and sisters would have put their baby brother through college if he hadnt saved them the trouble by growing a foot taller than the rest of the hayes boys however he did more than simply grow elvin was cut from his high school team as a freshman and again as a sophomore and he recalls that it sort of hurt my pride he made the team as a junior and as a senior was cited by scholastic magazines allamerican board no easy trick for one playing at an obscure black school in an obscure southern town overcoming obscurity has been a constant battle with hayes at the start of the current season the basketball knowledgeablescoaches pro scouts players and sportswritersknew that he was a sure pick to end the season as a threetime allamerica he rewrote the uh record book as a sophomore whaled even more as a junior and in the third game of the current campaign passed the alltime record for points scored by a texas collegiate player when he took to the court this year against alcindor hayes hitting at a clip on the year trailed only cagers for alltime college scoring honors he left the court trailing and unless he loses interest in the game by the time he hangs up his jersey in march he will have tallied some points in his career enough to make him the second highest college scorer ever only oscar robertsons total college points will go unchallenged that means hayes will have outscored such former allamericas as rick barry jerry west elgin baylor and bill bradley wilt chamberlain didnt play his senior year of college and thus is not among those who top the list hayes is the perfect comer man for the pros comments fuzzy levane former coach of the new york knicks and st louis hawks yet to fans across the nation before the january encounter with alcindor hayes star was somehow without the tag super it has been his mean fate to play basketball in football country and even meaner fate to play basketball in the shadow of a man who has received more publicity than avis gives hertz when sophomore hayes was averaging points and rebounds per game hitting from the floor at per cent the nations hardcourt fans were in a trance waiting for alcindor who was passing the time of day with the ucla frosh but the lean cat with the voice as soft as the touch of his jump shot was by no means in a trance all he did upon first meeting alcindor last march in the ncaa semifinals was outpoint him to and outrebound him to and when he walked off the court he made no secret

elvin shoots with arch much like a man a foot shorter would do you start counting the jumpers he makes and end up realizing it would have been a lot easier to count his misses and he laughs when you tell him that a cat is not supposed to hit from out the way he does but he doesand keeps right on pushin elvins determination to jumpshoot his way out of obscurity doesnt come as a surprise to

change her looks clothes and makeup helped a little but as a whole she was faced with the monotonous prospect of looking the same way all her life not so today times have changed to the point where a woman can be a brunette in the morning a redhead at noon and a blonde at night all she needs is a good collection of wigs a fine example of what wigs can do for a woman was given by leslie uggams this year in the broadway show hallelujah baby cast as georgina franklin a yearold ageless person leslie swept through years of negro life in america with six wig changes she first appeared on stage in a currently fashionable sassoon cut then her personality changed and she went back to the turnofthecentur in a topsy wig tifying plantation life next she was a maid and by the s a dancer in a night club chorus line wearing a flapperishly short wig cut evenly on both sides with a shingle neck ten years later she was in a wpa project with her hair looking very feminine soft in front with fluff wave in the back by the s the depression was over and leslie had become ultra feminine in a long page boy reminiscent of the rita hayworth look elegance was added a decade later with a french twist and chignon finally she returned to the s her wig very similar to the s look but cut unevenly on the sides and teased from the flat look ronald demann the stylist responsible for changing leslies many moods in hallelujah baby explains each decade had a definite look which we tried to capture in leslies wigs and dress demann who has designed hair styles for shows including marne and ftinny girl adds with leslie it is very easy to create moods she wears wigs beautifully and so can other women if they so desire e ver since antiquity wigs have been kmowm to man but in few periods of history have they been so popular as they are today among american women and particularly women of color few bigname entertainers get along without them and some like the famous supremes are knowm for the glamorous way in which they wear them but the ever expanding group of wigwearers far exceeds those in public life it is estimated that million women in the united states now own at least one wig and that the business is grossing million annually only a million business in it is expected to reach a billion dollars by one time she wore a oneinch bob that gave her a pixie look but notes it was cute but it wasnt exactly what i needed for my career she chose the short wig she now wears because i wanted something that would emphasize my features and personality so that when people see my picture they wont think im leslie uggams or barbara mcnair the two people to whom they usually compare me convenience seems to be a major reason why many women buy wigs those who are going on vacation often consider them a necessity for they can go swimming without worrying about the effect on their hair frequently wigs are pointed out as timesavers for a woman can the reasons why women have come to rely so heavily on wigs within the past years are as diverse as the styles in which they come for one thing wigs are now available to just about anybody and the lures to the potential customer are unlimited one hair stylist laughingly notes even saw an ad the other day saying we acctpt welfare checks some are tempted by the suggestion that they wear now pay later and with this incentive or without it they rush to their hairdresser for over and underthecounter purchases for many they are a longawaited answer to hereditary hair problems while still others have found them a eonvenient wav to change their looks at will pretty singerturnedactrcss angeline butler frankly admits why she owns a wig and an equally expensive fall a partial hairpiece a former coed at fisk university and a participant in some of the early student sitin demonstrations angeline finds the wig to be a means of creating the type of image she wants to project my own hair is rather long but its uneven and very hard to manage she explains its that in between kind of hair that has no body at iso deposit her wig at the hairdressers and have it styled while she tends to other matters the added appeal of aftersix glamour turns many women into wig cinderellas in the evening a womans hair might have been a mess in the morning even up to within minutes before she goes out but the moment she puts on her wig she looks like another person some have become so accustomed to their wigs that they cant bear to remove them in front of their husbands and wear them even when they go to bed women shouldnt be as dependent on wigs as they are says new york stylist walter fountaine wigs should be considered accessories not permanent fixtures the real danger in overwearing wigs is that women are more likely to get lazy and to let their own hair go one hairdresser recalls a woman came to me to do her hair and i refused to do it she hadn t touched her hair in three months oh god it was nasty he emphasizes that women should give their hair the same time and attention they devote to their wigs but many dont before a woman buys a wig she should consult her hairdresser instead some see a certain style in a magazine and tear it out bring it to their hairdresser and say i want that they will insist on having that style of wig even if it does nothing for their appearance once a woman has definitely decided to buy a wig she must consider how much she wants to pay for it what style she wants and what alor all of which should be consistent with her budget and needs many hairdressers consider handmade european wigs the best in con j struction and most durable but they generally are expensive running anywhere from to american machinemade wigs run much cheaper and can be bought for as little as at that price though they tend to look like wigs at rose morgan s house of beauty in new york nearly per cent of the clients own wigs most women want to be wellgroomed and know their hair will not last more than two or three days mrs morgan notes prices have come down considerably so now many more women can afford wigs machinemade wigs that once sold for and now cost and she adds that some handmade wigs once running to now sell for as little as if a woman cant afford two or three different wigs shell be eencorned with how long she can wear her one before it gives out vvith proper care a wig can last a long time if its worn daily it should be done every two weeks not by the woman but by her hairdresser if its worn regularly it should be done every month how long a wig lasts will depend on the care it gets from its user but regardless of cost or durability women are going to continue wearing wigs if anything theyll stop taking them off altogether

and turtle neck sweater became a familiar one to the thousands of marchers as bob popped up almost everywhere there was a picture to lie taken he worked late slept in his clothes and arose at daybreaknever even having a chance to change clothing during the four days of the march bob had earned tlie right to an assignment with the ebony team through earlier pictures shot on speculation for both ebony and jet vve knew that he could take excellent pictures from the selma march coverage we learned something elsethat here was a xonng and talented photographer who was also a wann

thing bob is a damned good photographer and then they would add and hes a heluva nice guy bob did assignments for ebony in the south for about a year and then decided that he had to go to vietnamhe wanted to record honestly the story of the gis in the war shortly before bob left for vietnam in the fall of he brought his mother mrs russell eaton of milwaukee wis to visit the ebony offices later

foremost apostle of peace and nonxiolcnce in the world today was dead during the first phiuses of the rush and confusion that iwsets any major publication in the coxcrage of a tragic news event our

administrators the yoimj against the old negroes against blacks and negroes and blacks against whites from one end of the country to the other tin revolution rages in classrooms corridors audi toriums stadiums student unions and dormi torics the struggle is bitter abrasive explosive and it assumes in some cases the aspects o a campus civil war it is a daybyday struggle of attrition of symbolic sniping and campu guerilla probes punctuated from time to time by pitched battles which involve state troop ers campus security guards policemen anc national guardsmen this is a new kind of wara war for the mind but for all that it is a real war with real battles and real casualties all over the land impassioned black youth are struggling oftentimes physically for the ultimate in power the power to control the cultural apparatus which defines reality and shapes and maims minds since last fall the black cultural revolution has raged with unprecedented fury on high school and college campuses black students have seized and burned whiteoriented college newspapers and magazines they have struggled physically with whiteoriented college editors and administrators they have disrupted football games faculty meetings and college assembliesand they have threatened to burn down whole colleges a la detroit in massive shows of force they have shut down institutions like san francisco state cential state ohio and south carolina state in one week in march black student unrest closed down or threatened to close down tuskegee institute morgan state college cheyney state college and howard universit during this same period there was a continuingand largely unreportedcivil war in almost eer bigcity school system black students fought pitched battles in corridors and auditoriums and lunch rooms and repeatedly walked out of high schools in protest over whiteoriented courses and whiteoriented black and white administrators in the course of this remarkable cultural cataclysm black high school and college students have created a black student movement modeled on the revolutionary student movements of asia and latin america this movement is ijowered by a chain of black and afroamerican student unions on white college camxuses and black_poweroriented student organizations on black college campuses tlie movement and the black cultural revolution it projects have created dual crises in the educational world and the black community and these crises are likely to reach gargantuan proportions as the mushrooming radicalization of black students continue for make no mistake about it black students are embarking on a revolutionary course unparalleled in the history of american education on one level the students are demanding a relevant black education with indepth studies of afroamerican history and culture and the political and economic problems of the afroamerican community on another level they are engaged in a painful and necessary labor of selfdiscovery selflegitimization and selfdefinition and both levels of action and interest make a deeper thrust against what the students call a racist society and the racist educational institutions which perpetuate that society the students who call themselves the liberated black students see themselves as rebels against a hopelessly white educational apparatus which maims illiterate blacks and trains literate blacks to be enemies of their own people they say they are fighting the old tradition of black students receiving degrees and turning their backs upon the black community they want to end the traditional isolation between black students and ghetto residents and to relate themselves meaningfully to the black liberation struggle they want to produce a new breed of students with a revolutionary spirit a new breed of students who will recognize that they are black first and students and professionals secondly a new breed of students who will recognize that their first responsibility is to return to the black community and to dedicate their skills and resources to the technical and cultural development of that communit they want to revolutionize the consciousness of black students they want to create revolutionary black professionals who will become if the occasion demands professional revolutionaries the liberated students reject individualism they reject the idea of making it saying and apparently believing that no black man makes it in american society richard a joseph of the afroamerican society of dartmouth says the challenge of our black generation is not to make it in american society for this is in many ways a negative goal today but to assist in the building of strong and free black communities that would one day make apparent to the american mainstream how far it has strayed from the true path harry edwards the professor who serves as offcampus coordinator of the united black students of san jose state college echoes this sentiment and adds the time is gone for black cats to flee to baldwin hills a middle class section of los angeles and eat pickles and hors doeuvres and watch the riots on color tv the leaders of this mov ement are an impassioned and apocalyptic lot they are not bound by the dogmas of the past or the mortgages of the future they are totally alienated from traditional black leadership and established white leadership their heroes are stokelv carmichael che guevara frantz fanon kwame nkrumah mao tsetung julius nyerere and malcolm_x they are opposed to the draft the war in vietnam and the traditional rewards of the system intensely proud of their blackness and the unique cultural inheritance of black people they are profoundly disillusioned by the style and accomplishments of educated and affluent blacks they are not convinced that a black man can be successful and honest in white america the negro who prev iously enrolled in white institutions says f woody lee of dartmouth was firmly convinced that his path to success was being facilitated through an adherence to middleclass values of the white society he unfalteringly adopted the protestant ethic and even embellished it to suit his own needs in order to insure his acceptance into the white world thus he compromised his own integrity as a black man despite all the insults to his integrity that he had endured in the end he had become little more in the eyes of many whites than a genteel nigger a showcase coon and even more cruelly he found that whites easily used him as a justification to deny other negroes freedom and equality embittered by the rhetoric of the american dream and the myth of onebyone acceptance of acceptable negroes black students like lee are projecting a new role for black students and black professionals they are refusing to accept a role and a place defined by white people is there no road open to the educated negro paul r williams of princeton asks except that of either martyrdom or uncle tomrv within the circle of black student alienation there are differences in tone and emphasis some students believe they should sell their books and buy mls others dream of an american sierra maestra where they can do castros thing still othersthe majoritybelieve they can make a contribution to the liberation of black people by restructuring the educational system and by debrainwashing black students and black professionals the movement which reflects these different currents is in some respects a new stanza of an old song the movement grew out of and reflects the tensions of the black liberation movement it was out of the black colleges of the south that the first deep currents of the freedom movement came but when white america failed to respond to the neat polite nonviolent students of the first phase of the movement new studentsamong them stokely carmichael of howardcalled for a new departure many of the students of the second wave were from northern ghettos and some were authentic products of block culture more importantly these students had lived through the traumatic failures of the first phase of the movement and had been deeply influenced bv malcolm_x and third world revolutionaries unlike the first wa e of students who left the camions to go south the second wave decided that revolution like charity begins at home in the period between and afroamerican and african students began to form student cells at east and vvest coast universities the emergence of the black_power movement and the explosions of watts newark and detroit transformed these cultural cells and gave them new dimension and purpose by the fall of s college campuses from coast to coast were honevcomhed with militant black nuclei and around these highlycharged nuclei revolved larger groups of nonstudents former students and potential students most of the new student groups have names wliich project afroamerican or black themes the association of african and afroamerican students of harvard the association of black students of wayne afroamericans for progress of dillard the societv of afroainerican students of morgan state and the united black students association of san jose state college some names however are more individualistic the onyx society of the city college of new york the soul students advisory council of merritt college fmo for members only of northwestern university and katara revolution of the washington heights campus of new york uni ersity most of these organizations are dc facto black with a sprinkling of african and third world philippine spanishamerican and asian students but one of the most militant groups the united black students of san jose state college has a handful of white students a leader of the group says we dont discriminate on the basis of color we discriminate on the basis of philosophy i agree strongly with marcus garvey that blackness is a philosophy of life only secondarily related to color on both white and negro college campuses a minority of the black students form the active cadres of the black student organizations black student leaders say however that they are supported by a majority of the black students be that as it may the fact remains that white and negro college administrators are marching by the sound of the black radicals drummer the black student groups range from reformist cultural groups to awedly revolutionary organizations like the black students union of san francisco state our direction the san francisco state unit says is revolutionarv our method is organization our goal is black_power our essence is black humanism the strategy of the militant wing of the movement was detailed with militant bluntness by fred beauford in the february issue of the faith the organ of the black allied student association of nyu beauford said black students in the north should develop a strong cadre to go out into the black community and should try to increase their numbers on campus so that meaningful pressure could be brought to bear as for the south he said that on campuses where black students are in the majority they should increase their agitation with the ultimate goal of capturing these schools they should use the method of direct confrontation presenting their schools adminstrations with the demand that if their education is not made more relevant to the demands of being black the meaningless process will be disrupted finally after the schools have been captured they should be used as jolitical bases organizing and indoctrinating the black community under the banner of academic freedom this strategy is being adopted by an increasingly large number of students who say there is no meaningful alternative to tactics of disruption ben stewart chairman of the black students union of san francisco state savs the significant new facet is disruption if you can convince people by rational means there is no problem but if you cannot you have to move to another level if they are going to say no and do you wrong then they have to suffer whether reformist or revolutionary the black student groups are dedicated to the proposition that the educational process is totally irrelevant to the needs of black people student leaders say the number of black high school dropouts is increasing and that the percentage of black students in stateowned universities is decreasing they say this is no accident and charge that the information black high school children receive is alien to them dealing almost exclusiely with white culture they also charge that state universities are becoming the exclusive province of the white middle class fred beauford of new york university says this is due partly to the general rise of tuition in the private university tuition has risen to such an extent that only the welltodo can afford to pay without a tremendous effort this has forced the middle class to turn to the public institutions one of the w ays the white middle class assures itself the necessary space is to keep the admisssion standards high this eliminates most black students because they are unable to gras the underlying assumptions contained in the admission test black organizations in the north should concentrate on the public universities and colleges public colleges have traditionally been the stepping stones for the outgroups in american society they should be forced to resume that role we must not be fooled by these token projects our demands should be to lower the standards and to charge tuition to those families that can afford it at a deeper level the black students are challenging the orientation of socalled liberal institutions the afroamerican society of dartmouth says iv y league schools represent the white anglosaxon protestant culture which is eminently ethnocentric the black students union says san francisco state oftentimes called the most liberal white icgc in america is a freak factory the black students organization of bostons simmons college says that liberal institution has systematically excluded all aspects of contempo rary as well as historical black culture the organization adds in short this campus is a microcosm of middleclass american society the society which has cast the black masses into their pathetic condition these statements to some of us perhaps sound unnecessary even overly emotional and melodramatic when one considers the surface serenity of life here at simmons we feel that the exploitation of black students and the indignities which confront us here on campus is different from the dilemma of black people around the globe only in one essentially insignificant respectit is more sophisticated less blatant p ff nicer interestingly enough black students on predominantlynegro campuses make the same charges against negro administrators in their view paternalistic negro administrators are stifling black development by mindlessly imitating white educational methods which ignore the cultural and political needs of black people on both white and negro campuses the operative word is blackness and the operative method is integrationblack integration on one level the students are trying to define a still unanswered question tvho and what is an afroamerican and how can he sing his song in a land which still regards him as a stranger in a desperate attempt to answer that question black students are turning their backs on whites and forming black communities within the college communities they usually spend almost all of their spare time within the veil of the black student organization they study together and play together they go en masse to college events and they sit together in general it can be said that what black students aidplaud white students do not applaud and vice versa at almost every white college militant black students have established black and equal tables and sections at the student union at the university of wisconsin they hang out in a corner of the rathskeller called cccolored comer at san francisco state they swing together in a corner of the student union called blood alley as a militant community within a community the black students have their own style afro hairdos beards and african robes are in and their own rules and regulations white fraternities and sororities today many college administrators are worried about black students who dont want to date white girls or join white fraternities and sororities most administrators however are playing it cool hoping that the whole thing will soon blow over some black student leaders say administrators are killing them with kindness and student activity funds others complain that administrators are using negro students in unsubtle attempts to destroy the influence of black students as can be imagined tension is rising between negroesnonmembers of the black student unionsand blacks and blacks and whites the groups exchangc snide remarks in dormitories and student unions and occasionally there are fullscale battles there is extreme tensions in some dormitories one black coed said she lost four white roommates in one semester a northwestern university coed said her white roommate cracked under the black_power strain and ran screaming and shouting into the night the white girl later called her father and told him according to the black they do not suffer bigotsor white liberals or negroesgladly many in fact think it is a waste of time to talk to white people and in the new order of things it is considered extremely bad form to date across the color line violators are ridiculed and shunned in the good old days some college administrators and many white students worried about the militance of black students who dated white girls and demanded entrance into coed that she didnt want to live with students who were always talking about loving their black brothers and sisters at the university of chicago northwestern city college of new york and other universities blacks and whites are pressing a quiet but bitter graffiti war at finley hall at city college a sign appeared one night honkies attention your time has come the next night the following sign appeared lege when a newsletter of the afroamerican student group of northwestern was mutilated someone retaliated with the sign black is beautiful the next dav these words were crossed out and another statement was added white aint so bad these words were immediately replaced by the following statement black is still beautiful on almost all campuses black student organizations have been accused of reverse racism but black students say it is monstrous to call a method racist which was designed to combat racism they say no black student is ever fully accepted on a white college campus they never let you forget that you are black lenneal j henderson of berkeley says we decided to remember that we arc black black students also say that there is a difference in the sensibilities and interests of black and white students and that it is no longer useful or relevant to denv it thev are talking about the beatles one black student said and we are digging james brown they are doing dances harlem was doing five months ago and we are doing dances harlem is doing now they are talking about reforming the system we arc talking about destroying it beyond all that black students say they must integrate themselves and achieve real power before they can integrate with whites we must seek some type of cultural and spiritual relevance among ourselves james turner chairman of fmo of northwestern university says the emphasis is on a positive program of blackness and functional nationalism the emphasis is on an ingathering of black peoplea focusing of energy spiritual cultural and intellectual we are going through a thing we are going through a rite de passage turner and other black student leaders see tbe black students organizations as windbreaks behind which black students can at dartmouth william mcciirinc of the mroamerican society tutors floyd mayfield of hanover high most units sponsor tutoring programs develop and maintain a strong black identity to counteract the debilitating forces of white institutions there is an almost religious fervor to this ingathering students cling to the student organizations with a passionate intensity and many speak of sudden conversions barbara butler of northwesteni university said this group has reaffirmed my identity as a black person i came from a suburb in virginia and i didnt know anything about me or my people this group hit me in the facemy reahty as a black person and now its like a juice to me my life blood at northwestern and other universities and colleges black students unions have a threepronged program based on the development of black identity the development of a blackoriented curriculum and the employment of black professors technicians and laborers the development of strong ties with the black community and the black liberation movement members of the unions sponsor cultural programs monitor whiteoriented classes counsel draft resisters and tutor ghetto youth they also seek out promising black youth and demand that the college administrations admit them one student leader said we are going out into the community and finding students with college potential according to our judgment not according to the judgment of the system we are getting these students into college we are insisting that the college forget all that qualifications crap and accept them in addition to these programs black student unions maintain practical links with local liberation movements and organize study groups and black_power organizations in local high schools on the west coast for example students are pushing the olympic boycott and arc supporting the defense efforts of huey p newton a campus hero who is awaiting trial on a charge of slaying a white policeman although black students constitute a small minority on white college campuses usually from to per cent they have had an impact out of all proportion to their numbers it is a rare white college president today who is not searching for at least one more black faculty member and for ways and means to include at least one afroamerican history course in the curriculum it is a rare negro college administrator who is not having second thoughts about the traditional goal of creating black harvards and black northwestems of greater immediate consequence are the first tentative changes in policy and personnel largely as a result of the action or the threat of action by black students the number of black students though still small has increased and will undoubtedly increase even more by next fall new and black faculty members secretaries building construction workers and laborers have also been hired more significantly there has been a cnicial crack in the white wall of the traditional whiteoriented curriculum an institute of black studies coordinated by nathan hare who was discharged from howard university has been initiated by san francisco state college among the courses in this pioneering program are black literature african languages black education and the economics of racism another bay area school merritt college of oakland has also inaugurated a black studies program and will soon become the first american junior college to offer an a a associate of arts degree in afroamerican studies the courses include afroamerican histor afroamerican writers african civilizations and contemporary education of afroamericans at merritt and san francisc state black student leaders are demanding an even deeper plunge into blackness san francisco state students are now demanding a new layer of courses including one on black heroes great personalities of the third world malcolm_x mao tse tung frantz fanon kwame nkrumah joino kenyatta sid walton tile merritt college professor who played a key role in developing the black curriculum has suggested additional courses in business development of black businesses and financial institutions and home economics introduction to the preparation of soul food it has not escaped the notice of black students at predominantlynegro colleges that two white collegesmerritt and san francisco statehave a more advanced black curriculum than any predominantlynegro college despite or perhaps because of its successes the black students movement stands today at a critical crossroad tensions are building within and without the movement and a vigorous internal debate is raging over the right road to the future some student unions are saying that other student unions are too conservative and some students unions are appalled over what they consider the romanticims and nihilism of some of the fringe elements musing over these problems one week recently two radical west coast student leaders doubted whether some student leaders have the discipline to dedicate themselves to a sustained longrange struggle they know one of the leaders said that its not going to happen tonight and they are not afraid to confront the long tomorrows by devising a longrange strategy other critics within the movement say that some of the fringe elements are disturbingly antiintellectual and that malcolm mao and che guevara are more often admired than read these tensions and problems which are perhaps inevitable under the circumstances have not dampened the enthusiasm of the student leaders who are pushing ahead with daring new plans to disrupt and revamp the educational process at white colleges and predominantlynegro colleges and high schools most student leaders say the next item on the agenda is the creation of regional student organizations which can be linked to a national student structure with a revolutionary orientation student leaders are also exploring the possibility of creating new institutions the present afroamerican studies program sid walton says was built into the framework of the white school structure as an expedient measure only ideally black schools black school districts black universities are needed across the country james turner of northwestem university was expressing the same idea many of us he said are going to realize as our consciousness develops that we are not going to be able to function in white schools as we get hip to these things we are going to have to think in terms of getting ourselves together here so we can go back and form firstclass and relevant black universities it is too soon vet to sav where all this will lead but some commentators sav the student movement and the black cultural revolution it envisions mark a rite of passage for america as well as for black students in the long run says iiarr edwards of san jose state black cats with education could become the brains of a movement for the political and economic deelopment of the black communitv or they could become the brains of a real revolution if this society goes for what is right black people could develop their own institutions and culture and this movement could be the greatest thing to ever hit this country it all depends on the intransigence of the white community the only thing you can say now is that the movement is going to spell the development or tlie ruin of this country it all depends i t was a cold rainy iiiglit the type of weather that makes most folks sit at home and watch tele ision but tonight was diilerent the theatre was doing the best business it had done in years down the block and around the corner the line stretchedteenagers children even businessmen and their wives inching towards the box olrce the occasion a dionne warwick concert and the reason why so many diilerent people had come out on such a night well one youngster sail simply i guess we just all dig her kind of music dionnes kind of music belies all of the critics attempts to pigeonhole her style for her singing eludes a simple definition rhythm and blues gospel rock jazz pop nothing quite fills the bill and yet she is all of themas one fan said glowingly she is the universal warwick although onstage she creates an image of a cliic sophisticated singer dionne says im just a child in this business it has been only six years since she gambled and made a record but like so many negro singers she is a product of church spirituals and gospel choirs a girl who has been singing for as long as can remember dionne grew up in orange n j where her mother and father ijoth fervent methodists settled to rear their three children mother was business managr for a renowned gospel group the drinkard singers and as the oldest child little marie dionne warrick was the standin singer when the group needed a replacement by the time she was a teenager she had had years of experience singing at church socials and in the choir with her cousin mvrna utlev and sister dee dee she started her own group the gospelaires dionne left the trio when she vvon a fouryear scholarship to study music education at ilartt college of music in hartford conn but to her dismay she discovered that her courses required am music theory classes she says today god those morning classes were just awful how many human beings can function at am she rejoined the gospelaires during her vacations to do background work for recording groups in new york while the stars would sing she remembers wed be backing them up with lots of oohhs and ahhhs as usual dionne would give her all to her partincluding the oohhs and ahhhsuntil the lead singers wondered who she was as it turned out that loudsinging background girl got the break wearing jeans and pigtails dionne was giv ing forth in the background one dav when burt bacharach then a relativelv little knowai song writer came in to listen she was singing louder than every body else be recalls so i couldnt help noticing her not only was she clearly audible but dionne had something just the way she carries herself the way she works her flow and feeling for the music it was there when i first met her she had and still has a kind of elegance a grace that very few other people have bacharachs partner lyricist hal da id shared the enthusiasm and they asked her to make demonstration records for them in their efforts paid off dionne sang dont make me over the trio signed a contract with scepter records and dionne had a hit record marie dionne warrick became known as dionne warwick when scepter misspelled her name on the record label and after three years of college thc would be music teacher left for a career in show business today still together the trio has sold more than eight million single records and four million albums success means that dionne must cope with the se enday a week schedules the telen ision appearances the rehearsals the interviews and the photography sessions all of which she finds difficult she sometimes resents the press incessant demands on her privacy especially after a long day when photographers ask for just one more picture despite all thats happened to me inside i havent changed she insists and ill always be a ery private person to protect herself she maintains a cool reserve toward most strangers if she feels the press is bothering her too much she will disappear and lock the door of her dressingroom to be alone with husband bill elliott once alone she can sit down slip off her shoes and open a bag of cheese enmehies t love to eat she savs cheerfullv as she munches away with a shrug she also admits to smoking up to three packs a day then adds theres a lot of things i could do to protect my voice but if i did id feel like a cripple and shopping that passionate female sport is almost a mania with her well she muses backstage in chicagos mr kellys nightclub i came to this engagement with three suitcases full of clothes ill probably ha e to buy three more to cart away the rest of the stuff ive bought see that she says while proudly pointing to a photo she had produced from one of her bags that was one of my greatest moments the photo shows her performing for a crowd of young people at san franciscos golden gate park and the scene was one of flowers hip pies and dionneall in the same groove man i dig that scene she exclaims its wonderful especially if you understand itit means peace just peace she sighs if i could have my way all of my audiences would be like those kids the college kids when i play college dates they make me say to myself yeah thats why im in this businesswhat a groo e then with a sudden switch of allegiance that only a woman could understand she goes on to explain that she feels it her duty to visit vietnam i want to go she savs firmlv those black entertainers who refuse to go to vietnam are afraid they might get shotand thats their only reason theyre not worried about principles you know there are babies fighting this war yearold guys who havent begun to li e and theyre carry ing guns at some of these guys havent even kissed a girl i want to do something for these kids who are out there protecting me because theyre doing something purposeful radiating a super selfconfidence dionne announces that nothing can stop her from doing what she wants to do if she wants to travel and entertain in the south she does and bigots better stay out of her way coolly she remarks to me mississippi is just a long word theyxe got their problems but theyre not going to make them my problems some of these southern kids ha e grown up in such an environmentwhy theyre trying to develop the culture i have why should belittle myself for them and when someone does try a little prejudice on her she makes sure they get their equal return she wrote her councilman when a hartford restaurant would not serx e her and again when a store in the south refused to sell her a s blouse how could you afford this blouse they said authorities closed both dionne uses the same tough treatment for hecklers after all she explains most of the audience has come to hear me sing and they deserve to get their moneys worth im not going to have my performance or their evening ruined just because of some drunk she points to a chicago engagement where a group of com entioneers from alabama razzed her during a song she remembers one of the gents yelled i voted for george wallacewhat do you think of that and when i bmshed that off they said hey hes riglit here in the audiencenow what do you say well i just stopped and told them not muchbut we all have our hangups dont we despite her cool selfassurance dionne admits that inside im a ery emotional stupid person one day she archly told a radio announcer that she was ready to star on broadway and the next sat shattered in her dressingroom after the audience had heckled her off the stage the woman with mascaraed sloe eyes and opulent wardrobe counts the days until she can be home with the warwick clan to fondle and coo their babies and dash off to buy gifts for all of them someday dionne hopes to piit show business and resume her teaching career her husband bill who has been traveling with her since their marriage nine months ago admits man sometimes this business is exhausting and sometimes its just a drag dionne says i really want to make the big time but in a certain number of years no matter what happns im going to quit then im going to teach music in a public school and have my own family with a millioi kids although she has yet to achieve the lasting fame of her idolslena sarah or ellashe does have the unique ability to communicate with an audience to say something to people of all ages and colors for dionne the key to her talent and to her success is cry simple i cant do a puton job for an audience im just me dionne and i do the best i can for the people a s a veteran air force combat pilot who has flown missions in fs over korea and missions in fs over vietnam lt col james e p randall is eminently qualified to judge the combat fitness of americas newest jet fighter bomber the oncecontroversial swingwing fllla stationed at nellis air force base near las vegas nev he heads a section inolved in what is known as category iii testing of the plane category i testing is done by the ilanes builders category ii testing by an outside agency hired by the air force randalls work contributed to the recent decision to test the fiiia in combat because of its sophisticated radarguidance system the fiiia can fly automatically toward a chosen target at night and in all kinds of weather with its twoman crew it can reach speeds of miles an hour and by varying the angle of its wings slow down to less than miles per hour for landing on short airstiips its bomb load capacity is five times that of a world war ii bomber and twice that of anything now flying except for the eightengine b such versatility pushes the cost of the fllla to million or twice as much as fighterbombers in current use such as the f its a real good plane in terms of what it can do says randall weve proved that here in our initial look it is outstanding in level bombing and the accuracy of its navigational and bombing systems randall adds we fully expect the accident rate to be reduced because of the planes lowspeed characteristics it can go coasttocoast without refikling which means it can stay over the target area longer also it can be used as an interceptor of hostile aircraft and is armed with a gatling gun and airtoair missiles if randall had been flying the fllla on october its blinding speed might have saved him from being shot down while bombing a bridge in a vietnam ravine some gunner got lucky he says referring to a ground fire hit which knocked out his planes hydraulic system and made his plane unresponsive to controls the problem was being in the ravine randall explains he managed to climb to about feet before the controls went out completely randall was now northwest of hanoi with only one thing to do bail out luckily the wind drifted him toward some nearby hills and amid shouting and gunfire randall escaped into the jungles where he was picked up two and a half hours later by a helicopter i t was a scene the two louisiana fanners would neer forget right before their eyes were piles of sweet potatoes grown by fellow negro fanners over a vegetable bin of a siipemiarket in the nations capital was the brand name coop sweets and secretary of agriculture orville l freeman was making the first purchase while t cameras filmed the event joseph malbrough president of the grand marie vegetable producers coop of sunset la swelled with pride coop manager robert landry cleared his throat trying to control emotion then muttered wevc finally made the big time their visit to washington d c last december for the historic ceremony signalled a triumph for the two farmers and their colleagues back home for the first time their negroowned and operated coop was able to market its produce in a major metropolitan area in the past buyers had shunned their coop refusing to do business with it most of their produce had to be stored in a warehouse now the breakthrough had come at last their rich crops of sweet potatoes okra cabbage tomatoes beans peas and squash would wind up in supermarkets throughout the country their first outing in the capital was a total success and the flurry of publicity resulted in the coop selling its remaining crates of sweet potatoes in one month ironically the individual most responsible for the triumph was not present for the event father lbert j mcknight a yearold brooklynborn catholic priest was hard at work behind the scenes lining up workers for a coop bakery that was swamped with yuletide orders in characteristic fashion he was dodging the limelight allowing the praise to fall where he believed it belongedon the farmers themselves it is in this spirit of dedication that father mcknight has spent years creating a peaceful economic revolution among the lowincome families of louisiana from a lowly start he has masterminded a widespread cooperative system that today is worth nearly a half million dollars in sales equipment and good will furthermore it has enriched the lives of more than poor farmers among the nourishing coop enterprises are a bakery a gasoline station a loan company shrimp fishing and vegetable production businesses even more significantly the father one of five negroes assigned by the holy ghost missionary order in the united states has given impetus to a coop boom that could change the economic texture of the entire south recently the parent organization the southern consumers cooperative foundation received a grant from the ford foundation to be used for the development of cooperatives unions lowincome groups in com in unities of alabama mississippi southwestern tennessee and other parts of louisiana in a few years the invxstment figure could triple though he is softspoken and virtually unknown among negro businessmen fatlier mcknight lias succeeded where more vocal militants have failed for vxnirs sncc and cohe sought to organize negro sharecroppers in the rural south only to become so disilltisioiicd by the poor rcstdts that they shitted operations to the crowded ghettos of the north but the catholic priest remained to persist in his projects with the poor developing an unshakable inner calm in the face of frequent attacks and debilitating reversals in when father mcknight was first assigned to the town of kaplan in vta million parish la he struggled for two years to conduct classes in reading and writing because nearly per eent of the negro residents were illiterate at the end of the project in he publicly admitted that he had failed to interest them in selfimprovement noting we had more teachers than students we began to ask oursckes why more people werent interested in bettering themselves the prist recalls then we realized for the first time that we were dealing with poor people who had to work long hours to make enough even to survive there was a poverty of spirit even worse than that of the body he explains they had been crushed psychologically convinced that the people in his parish lacked motivation father mcknight sought ways and means of igniting a spark of hope in those vvho considered themselves bevond hope finally he decided to organize coops that would be owned and operated by the poor people themselves he studied the cooperative philosophy during the summer of at st francis university in nova scotia when he returned to louisiana in the fall he was equipped with enough knowhow to begin what has become an amazing success story in his first endeavor the priest got each member of his parish to put up to establish a buying coop with this money groceries were bought in bulk and stored in the church basement members volunteered to serve as storekeepers on different days at the end of the year members were able to divide profits from goods sold for only a few pennies more than the wholesale price but well below the retail price the coop idea then spread from kaplan to abbeyville eight miles away and then to other towns as far as so miles away that was merely the beginning today father mcknight can state in the glow of hardearned success i have never seen an idea catch on so fast and grow b ack in wlien father mcknitiht launched his first statewide organization the southern consumers cooperative he had already garnered the support of more than k black farmers in a backward area of louisiana inspired by these plodding farm folk he trained them in the methods of pooling tluar resources so that they might accomplish as a group what none could ha e achieved as an indi idual within two years the organization receied its incoriwration papers from the state and by had established both a loan company and a thriving baker today the loan company called the peoples enterprise can make x loans to members on their signature w ith low interest rates members simply pay a s entrance fee and sign a contract to invest in the business through monthly payments the company now lias assets of sk and has loaned out sx in four years ecjually impressive is the success of the baker its specialty is a fruitcake whose recipe is so secret that only a few of the coops xx members know its composition the arcadian delight fruitcake has become a bestseller and a fivepound cake was shipped to president lyndon johnson as a christmas present with bakery assets now at about k the coop plans to broaden its plans for sales and nationwide distribution the coop businesses have won praise because they not only cam money but pro ide jobs for many c hange can be difficult to effect in a region where economic oppression is a tradition thus father mcknight and his selfhelp projects have been attacked by white extremists highranked catholic churchmen once were petitioned to have him transferred out of louisiana but the head of the holy ghost order intervened in rome to prevent the shift harrassment on the local level has been more persistent tvpical of this was the publication in the councilor official organ of the white citizens council of a recipe for a poerty fruit cake using these ingredients core mixed dates cheap wine sargent shriver dough from taxpayers sugar from the politicians baked ideas gullible public grain of salt then stir the gullible public to a frenzy soak the nuts in cheap wine mix all light and dark ingredients to a mulatto blend baste with sargent shriver heat quickly and serve while the odor is strong such ridicule is par for the course of this hardworking priest who also manages to keep intaet his member parish in delcambre la with the help of a white assistant father robert prahinski few negroes hae been accorded more scorn or abuse than father mcknight he had to fight off jabs from the press three years ago when he instituted the southern consumers education foundation and secured million to promote a head start program for preschool children the same public criticism continued when he solicited another x in funds from the office of eeonomic opportunity the agriculture department and the small business administration to finance a variety of projects but he has stood unbudging before what he calls an attempt to keep the poor impoxerished as his coop task force eagerly recruits farmers in hundreds of communities and as the products from successful coops move toward big city markets father mcknight looms as one of the most important leaders of the southnot only in the realm of economies but also as a political force while he has captivated his farming flock with financial projects he also has inspired them to seek other means of helping themselvesprimarily by using the ballot the result of his urging has been scores of negroes running for office for the first time and a new thrust toward organizing voter leagues and voter registration campaigns this too is part of his greater objective for the uiet cleric insists there is a close connection between economic coiitrol and political participation for those who control the financial processes of a region also control the politics the poor in acquiring economic prestige acquire a greater voice in politics and a freer rein to exercise their civil_rights f ormer heavyweight boxing champion sonny liston weighs about pounds davy jones member of the tv

a chance h is holiness maharishi mahesh yogi was sitting crosslegged on a deerskin rug spread sparingly over a shortlegged chair he looked exactly like hundreds of newspaper and magazine pictures i had seen of him christlike with long hair graying beard and robed in wliite only the lips were thicker the figure smaller the message not that of an only begotten son urging faith but a jetage adsoeate of a technique guaranteed to save with science and experimentation a world religion has failed awkwardly in stockinged feet and wrapped in a few fiirbcaring skins of my own i lowered myself onto one of the green cushions scattered over the walltowall yellow pad in an otherwise empty room behind the maharishi in a yellow and green frame was a large color picture of his teacher the gum dev who revived the ancient theorv of transcendentalism from which his holiness has founded the spiritual regeneration movement the international meditation society and the student international meditation society the latter of which has already attracted some students in the united states alone maharishi great sage mahesh family name yogi teacher smiled and i shivered as we faced each other there in his attractive bungalow beneath the high himalayas and above the sacred ganges on the grounds of his acre retreat ashram i had come not to meditate but in search of answers to the worlds mounting headache and americas number one domestic problemrace earlytoo earlythat morning i had flown to new delhi where i was joined by photographer t s satyan who had a taxi waiting we had driven ov er a hundred miles through sugar cane and brickmaking country past teeming market places and rural illages woven precariously through pedicabs pony carts ocarts bicycles and lumbering buses the last few miles had led along a rutted dirt road through the foothills of the mountain flushing deer and wild peacocks instead of tigers and elephants we had gradually worked our way up to the new mecca of todays seeking made famous by mia farrow sinatra already there by the beatles and their wives who later joined her and by the banteredabout names of celebrities even remotely likely to go we had waited in the yard of the gurus office from cold twilight into colder darkness warmed only by a cup of tea my appointment was for the following day but two hours after we arrived i had been taken by a flashlightcarrying disciple through the woods and over a bridge to his leader tomorrow the maharishi affirmed we would talk about the problem unfortunately no negroes had arrived the new york secretary i had been practically nursing through europe toward india turned out to be a polish girl with a negro friend who didnt make it meals would be taken with the odd trainees already gathered for the three month international meditation guide course and i was assigned to the guest house now occupied by an australian woman who didnt know it but was being moved that night to less pretentious student quarters further up the hill with her went the electric heater before dawm i desperately added the miracle space blanket my boy scout friend had given me to the silk comforter on my bed the next morning mr satyan and i joined the shawl and blanket wrapped neophytes who trooped into the open air dining room breakfast was served by an efficient bobhaired youth as the cawing of circling crows mixed with the roar of the ganges as it rushed o er its rocky bed and hhe sun slipped down the mountain side gradually warming mother earth and me testimony to the movement volunteered an englishwoman from the depths of her blanket was the way in which about of us arriving too late for the ferry and pony carts walked the last mile to the academy groped our way into the dark rooms of closed cottages and cleaned them upwithout a disgruntled word i wouldnt take three months leave from my job as manager in the building trades if i did not believe the course would help me commented a german who first heard about the maharishi when an academv was established in his country last year an american a dealer at las vegas gambling tables said he joined a transcendental meditation lecture course a year ago and now he is president of the group the public was getting on my nerves so much that i was about to quit my job he recalled but now the job is easier im much more tolerant than i was before as we stood outside of the meeting ball awaiting the arrival of his holiness for piija a service in memory of the spiritual masters who hae passed on a tall american youth came up the path carrying a flower and an apple face radiant he was walking on cloud five i asked him where he got the flower from his holiness he whispered reverently tve just been initiated the hall was halffilled with shoeless students and half with smoke from charcoal pots brought in for heat when the maharishi entered his disciples arose turned and greeted him with palms together in true indian fashion some fell to their knees and touched their foreheads to the floor as they chanted his praises in a brief ceremony two assistants waved lighted wicks over the painting of the masters while the maharishi recited verses from the hindu gita wdien the students were again seated his holiness assumed the lotus position on the platform before them and waited for the press to leave during the meditation period which followed the disciples scattered to all parts of the campus in search of solitude and sun our interview was to take place during the maharishis lunch hour so took up my post on the porch of his home and waited a young indian man sat in a chair on the lawm beside a small pool meditating a close disciple whiterobed sattyanand paced slowly up and down the path in front of the gate with its arch of garlands while i was admiring the neat beds of asters that lined the fence and idly contemplating the pebbled walls leading to meditation cellars sattyanand beckoned once again i was in the yellow and green sanctnar but this time the sun was streaming in the large picture windows the maharishi bid me sit beside him the young man came in from the yard and placed a tape recorder in front of his master while i adjusted my own machine and began to read from a list of questions wjint part can transcendental meditation plaij in the world racial situation in these times of tension can it help a black minority improve itself in a ichite society vc nefroes have tried religion it helped us throufih slavery but the church fails us now we tried subterfuc the appearance of happiness as a survival device hut ice are tired of masquerading time they say is the healer of all wounds yet years have passed since emancipation and we have found little surcease from racial oppression tried education hut it has proven to he no stranger to prejudice the constitution is the law of the land and the hill of hihts guarantees equality hut these laws are not enforced we tried nonviolence and took to the streets peaceful protest has helped just so much and in some areas so is arnold toynbee right when he says intermarriage is the answer is dr martin_luther_king right when he refuses to obey unjust laws arc the black nationalists right who advocate separatism can transcendental meditation turn off both black and white per these said his holiness slowly are very difficult questions we will discuss them in all aspects here today and come up with something which should work something tangible and your efforts of having come all this distance will bear fruit when i asked noting that it was less than half an hour before liis oclock lecture ill take five minutes and come back then we will find answers he returned from a backroom minutes later gave orders to the young man who turned on the recorder and left now said maharishi mahesh yogi quietly what are your questions again i repeated the list and his holiness began the two races in a nation are just like two brothers in a family no two men think or work alike their approach to things and experiences are always different yet it is possible for them to live in haidpiness and harmony and to make others more happy peaceful skin difference should not and as a matter of fact considering the truth of life cannot be an impediment to peace in life and harmony in life but he hastened to add anticipating my protest we see it does narrowness of vision he explained in a lot more words than this is the root of the racial problem the ingredient of hostility is not rooted in the skin but in the consciousness so through transcendental meditation we raise the level of consciousness in both black and white people once universal awareness begins to gain ground in ones conscious level all will be peace harmony and happiness q and how is this accomplished a transcendental meditation hits at the root of all problems which is narrowness of vision q do you think you could get a white negrohating sheriff in mississippi to practice transcendental meditation and do you ihink that it would change him a very readily see hostile tendencies are rooted in the stress and strain of the individual that is the basis of all hostilities a man is unhappy within himself and then he pounces upon others s he becomes more and more frustrated he has to be meaner because he can only react to the atmosphere so we neutralize the atmosphere by changing the generator of disharmony and stress and strain into a generator of harmony happiness and peace q our religion teaches that if a man is a practicing christian he docs not hate he loves arent you also preaching love a religion has been suggesting to man be kind be merciful help thy neighbor it suggests it does not prescribe a simple natural method to be awakened to universal awareness help thy neighbor docs not speak to daybyday activity what is needed is to change the kwel of a mans conscioirsness religions have their influence upon the psychology of a man thou shalt not steal it is a sin but if a man is frustrated inside he cant resist the temptation of stealing so what has to be changed is the consciousness only change of conceptions on the surface of understanding docs not transform a man q do you believe interracial marriage is a solution to the racial problem a no no interracial marriage can at best put an end to one race or it can put an end to both of the races bringing out the third type of race ha ha ha kill the two fighting men and out of the two fighting men create another man who will be fighting ha ha see not black and white fighting gennans and french both are vvhite it is national look at the small communities within one nation amongst english people there is plenty of fighting each tring to put down the other now there is no question of black and white no question of different nationalities but fight is there so fight which is a common thing cannot be justified by having only one aspect nationality or community or racial these are just pretexts we just make a pretext q but pretexts are killing us what p a now that is why the society has to be informed it is not white against black there will be lots of people black against black and innumerable people white against white therefore to raise the issue of imbalance in societv on national levels is a mistake the cure will be to hit out at the root of the problem to hit at tlie thing in the individual man which is making him fight q are you against the war in vietnam a against all wars but it has to be cured at the root from my analysis its not the military that creates a war its the civilians who remain frustrated tense and worried who are creating the atmosphere of tension we can create a society in the world where wars will be missing for a thousand years q do you believe we should continue to push for integration a certainly not by force because no integration will ever be harmonious if got by force we hold on to ourselves raise our level of intelligence unity and happiness and win sympathy and supxdort from the whole nation that is ver important q do you think the new tmtionalistic attitude of the negro is the right attitude a yes be proud of vvhat you are and this pride will be really significant and useful when one has that universal vision if im born black fine what is important to me is how much i contribute to civilization and how much better i leave the world to be black is no shame indian people are all black whats the difference i would be the last man to go to somebodys house who doesnt want me in it i have my own pride if somebody says you cant sit in my drawing room id say goodbye to your drawing room im not going there o n ansel road at the edge of clevelands seamy hough area there sits a sixstory brick building its smokedarkened facade turned toward the more pleasant treelined avenues of the citys rockefeller park few features distinguish tins edifice from its equally unimposing neighbors except the fact that it houses more than young women who have volunteered to undertake the challenging journey from the cultural and economic ghettos that have held them captive to a more fulfilling way of life on the other side of poverty tliis is the cleveland job corps center for women one of niral and urban centers set up since by the federal office of economic opportunity it is part of a novel experiment in rehabilitation a project designed to recoup the wasted resources of young men and women who might not have been able to make it in a society inclined to overlook their humanity and to ignore their needs these are the unemployed between the ages of and the disillusioned high school dropouts youngsters seeking to escape from the isolated capsules of appalachia mexicans and indians who defy the artificial limitations set on their worlds and for the most part members of that vast faceless army of young blacks who otherwise might be condemned to spend the rest of their lives drifting through a citys slum to reclaim these young people to offer them a better chance to make it through vocational training is the general objective of all job corps programs and yet there is something special about that place on clevelands ansel road like all the other urban centers it is operated by a private business or organization under federal contract but unlike the others it is the only center operated by a negro organization alpha kappa alpha sorority aka as it is widely known has taken its place beside some of this nations largest and most lucrative corporations as a federal contractor for a professionally staffed and thoroughly integrated job corps center this is the latest and most ambitious social service project initiated by this group of privileged collegeeducated black women who set up public health clinics in the cotton fields of mississippi as far hack as but above and beyond all fraternal tics their cleveland project is a dramatic demonstration of what the middleclass negro can do to help since feb when aic was granted one of the first three womens job corps contracts the sorority has proved its concern through tangible accomplishments the cleveland center operated under a appropriation claims the highest job placement rate of any similar center in the country it is one of but three to be headed by a woman the other two being operated by the ywca and the only one headed by a black woman its ability to hold new enrollces and to guide them toward definite goals as contributing and wellrounded citizens also is considered exceptional part of this success might be due to the genuine concern of all those involved in the centers operation beyond their professional qualifications they have more than a nodding acquaintance with the circumstances that have led their young charges down difficult roads to them the problems are not purely academic but very real and very human ones then too they are driven by the dedication and inspiration of the remarkable woman who serves as the centers executive director dr zclma george a walking institution who has managed to squeeze into one lifetime a number of successful careers as sociologist college dean globetrotting lecturer consultant on inteniational affairs opera singer un delegate housewife and humanitarian this unusual combination of the staffs commitment and its directors finesse have been welded into a powerful force that is daily reshaping human lives for the most part these are girls whose prospects in life would have been extremely poor explains edward spisak director of vocational milieu and the man responsible for the centers educational program the only jobs most of them might have found would have been day work or babysitting or of course existence on the relief rolls spisak who formerly sered as a training consultant for industrial firms states the basic theme of the centers entire program namely that skills are not enough our girls need so much more than that he notes for their selfconcepts have been so negative they have been brainwashed by the stereotqes attached to the poor and have come to believe many of the things said about them including that theyre slow and dull actually as many of them dropped out of school because they were too bright to get along within the system as those who found it difficult to keep up but most of their lives tliey have cxpcricnced nothing but disapproval it is our aim here to alter thcir patterns of thinking to lead them toward selfmotivation our program is only a start for everylxdy no portrait could be painted of a typical job cors enrollee since each is an individual but national statistics provide some indication of the factors that led them to deadends in their previous lives of the young people who hae passed through the program during its first three years six out of come from broken homes and per cent from homes where the head of the household was unemployed most have grown up living in substandard housing have not seen a doctor or dentist in yearsif cerand have not been able to find employment that paid them more than a xiittance about the girls at the cleveland center a few finer details might be drawn contrary to the commonly oiced opinion that the womens job corps consists mainly of the girls who have made a mistake only per cent had children before joining the program including those who are marricd for those with such responsibilities arrangements were made through local child care and welfare agencies before the girls were accepted the average grade completed in school is with about per cent being high school graduates of this latter minority few were adequately prepared to cope with the working world or to accept what little it was willing to offer them many of these girls came from the south where their total education was merely makeshift but just as many were casually passed through the school systems of urban ghettos emerging with nothing more than a third grade reading level almost without exception they were trapped in a sort of personal limbo and were seeking a workable wav out of their dilemmas for fannie smith a brooding but bright young woman from racine wis life after graduation from high school was just a matter of not being what i thought it would be she hoped to become a writer and learned about life while standing up for her principles in civil_rights demonstrations but she never thought about going to college until her senior year and then it was too late the only route left was to take a job working in a factory it was two years of miser of working on a job i almost hated while the bills piled up she recalls for fun there was nothing but local gossip or going home to watch tv or being surrounded by people who didnt care about the society theyre in people who just lived for the weekend i realized that i didnt want to be nothing but a machine for eight hours a day i didnt want to rent my life out part of fannies dissatisfaction was relieved when she was laid off from her factory job and could not find another but then the bills continued to pile up even after the unemployment checks had nm out she realized tliat was no life either when she enrolled in the job corps and was sent to the cleveland center other problems ensued the discipline of meeting curfews attending classes in fundamental mathematics of being forced out of a shell into social situations was difficult to accept but eventually she did so knowing that there was nothing to go back to except people in a rut and she understands that its just a matter of adjustment now she is president of the student council while crusading on the side eventually she hopes to pursue her greater dream of becoming a writer the hope that motivates girls like fannie lies in the graduates who did make it or at least are well on their way beverly smith a yearold high school graduate from clairton pa found herself in a position similar to that of fannies except that she lacked a definite goal yes id graduated from high school in a commercial course she recalls but i didnt seem to have enough skills to get a job and nobody would give me a chance to get experience i never thought about college because i didnt think i was college material as a frantic retreat from unemployment and ennui beverly enrolled in the job coqs she whizzed through her courses with such ease that she was encouraged to continue her education today she is a junior in business education at central state university in ohio and is quick to admit i guess the people at the center thought i had something i didnt think i had yet she believes that the benefits of her experience in cleveland can not be limited to her present academic pursuits i met different kinds of people from all over the country says beverly and i learned to accept people for what they really were this was the greatest thing that happened to me negro girls have not been the only ones to reap a rich harvest from the cleveland experience one of the lesser acclaimed aspects of the miracle on ansel road is that this institution has drawn and held the interest of many whites who were somewhat traumatized on their initial encounter with a microcosmic society in which blacks were the prevailing power structure a very few have left upon arrival unable to adjust to such a drastic change others have stayed on realizing that this chance for a better way of life was more important than personal prejudices far more have come to accept tlieir black associates as simply human beings with common needs such is the case of kentuckian celia lawson who grew up in the heart of appalachia just a stones throw from the state line between kentucky and tennessee the daughter of a coal miner celia quit school at the age of yet still she was able to pass her general educational development test ged and to acquire the equivalent of a high school diploma after less than a year at the cleveland center in the rural area of kentucky where she lived there was no work to be found and she soon acknowledged made a mistake but i was too proud to admit it before enrolling in the job corps celia never had known a negro she met her first one on the bus that took her away from her home immediately she understood an idea that had been planted in her mind long before by her father you cant live alone in this world and if you want to get along with people you will the idea proved helpful for on the bus that carried her to the cleveland center the driver was a negro upon arrival she realized that there were more negroes than whites and her resident counselor the person who would be her advisor on all matters involving dormitory living also was a negro her roommate was a negro girl from chicago in the beginning the girls might have been a bit distant celia remembers for these things work both ways but after a couple of weeks we were like sisters prejudice is just a matter of not knowing about others staff members at the center emphasize that the changing of girls attitudes toward themselves and others is as important as the matter of acquiring skills for a job without a positive approach to the world about her the girl will not be able to get along thus begins the process of reshaping a human being the process begins with the new enrollee being tested to determine her aptitudes and interests frequently the girl is not aware of the employment possibilities at hand or occasionally she might be so uninformed as to express a desire to become a psychiatrist tliough she has but a ninth grade education it is a matter of leading her toward a realistic evaluation of her goals and potentialities first of all the shortcomings of her previous education must be remedied and she is subjected to intensive courses that will improve her reading ability and knowledge of basic math since the pupil to teacher ratio is as low as to one and the method of instruction is somewhat tutorial with students being allowed to advance at their own pace the average youngster is able to gain one and a half grade reading level for every months spent in the job corps and almost two grade levels in mathematics and vocational training through a course entitled the world of work she is introduced to the tpes of jobs available and later to the finer details of the way in which she must conduct herself within the working world while enrolled in tlie job corps a girl is considered an employe of the federal government and is paid for undergoing training and rehabilitation like male enrollees she receives a month each month during her stay an additional is set aside by the government to be paid to her on termination as a readjustment allowance this way she can get her second start with a little nestegg if she happens to have a child at home or a family that is dependent an allotment can be deducted monthly for that purpose along with a ayear clothing allowance girls are supplied with government surplus clothing for their everyday needs and all the surplus material they want with which to design and make other garments in a supervised sewing room in the center quite often they make the clothing they will wear when they approach their goalonthejob training in the field in which they have been trained and its followup a permanent job the selfconfidence that enables a girl to seek something she has been taught to regard as beyond her reach does not come through mere chance the magic that makes the cleveland center work even in competition with bigger and richer concernsis one part know how but probably just as much a thing called heart or plain old soul this genuine concern is evident in the attitude of all staffmembers like mrs glyndora turner who mans the fifth floor sewing center and has encouraged more than one girl to make clothing not only for herself but for a child back home for mrs hazel t palmer the psychologist who serves as director of avocational milieu it is a matter of understanding girls who believe they are bad or are accustomed to being considered in the wrong we have no problem with fighting says the smiling and softspoken mrs palmer but now and then we might have a bit of bodily contact there are the resident counselors who note the girls take such pride in their rooms though they live three to a room most of them have never had a bed to themselves above this network of personal concern towers the commanding figure of the executive director herself dr zelma george who manages to persuade convince and cajole staff and friends into helping her achieve the impossiblebut only where the benefit of others is concerned to her job she brings a formidable raft of talents polished at some of the countrys finest universities where she studied and earned degrees including a phd in forceful but diplomatic dr george meets with r sargent shriver oeo director she credits centers success to supporters like louis seltzer c excleveland press editor and dr bennetta washington nd fr r womens job corps director sociology from new york university when she assumed directorship of the cleveland job corps center more than two years ago even the u s congress couldnt understand why a woman who had lectured around the world and served as everything from a probation officer to a un delegate would want to work with underprivileged girls but she has chosen to do so and in that role employs a variety of techniques speaking as a sociologist she points to the reason for the existence of the job coqs saying these youngsters represent the casualties from our school systems it is our objective to put ourselves out of business by making these sources aware of their failings in order that they might try to correct them she summons the fervor of an orator in defense of the program when taxpayers start complaining about the ast per girl about x a year for complete rehabilitation treatment they should consider what it woidd cost them if the person never was able to work and had to be supported and also what they would lose througlit the persons nonproductivity on this front she is capable of defying any authority without a single tremor last year she stood toetotoe with the entire house education and labor committee when she testified on behalf of the job corps questioned about the programs cost she snapped i dont know how to put a price on the rehabilitation of a human being one not to be content with things simply because they are the way they are dr george envisions a more extensive job corps program she is interested in seeing her girls have more contact with college students in order that they might be inspired to go further but has no intention of arranging contacts with people that the girls know wouldnt speak to them on the street more immediately her sight is focused on acquiring a larger and better equipped building for the cleveland center so that the girls will not have to rely on nearby community recreational facilities as they must now the need for it and the program in general is expressed by one of a group of prominent cleveland citizens whom dr george calls her mentors louis b seltzer former editor of the clev eland press remarks its strange how a country as materially successful as this one can be so neglectful in its handling of human beings partially its because those who do not live in our troubled urban areas build nests around themselves and only get excited when theres an explosion otherwise its academic to them but if we are to succeed we must help our young people before they get oft on tangents we must find a way to do things for those so urgently in need e ven in repose he looks like a cross between bob dylan and the wild man of borneo his hair is a foot long uncombed and stabs the air in every direction around a heavily pimpled face hes always swathed in such things as a grimy

highest honor the barton kyle young award presented to the graduate most exemplifying the ideals of scholarship aceomplishrnent and character this is an outstanding accomplishment for booker because aift is the only graduate school in the united states devoted exclusively to training young people for overseas business management careers graduation to booker however meant more than an award aatien he walked off campus a onetime army air force base he stepiocd into a ayear job as a management trainee with first national city bank in new york after completing his training he is slated to be assigned to euroje for further development toward becoming a bank officer booker benefits from the foresight of the late air force lt gen barton kyle young who founded alpt during world war he correctly anticipated that u s businesses would asllv increase their facilities abroad when peace came and lhal few young americans would be trained for such expansion today his school has about graduates serving american business gov ernment and serv ice organizations in countries the aift ciirrieulum puts its students through extensive language training which by years end gives them an average usable vocabulary of some words for conversational purposes students are also drilled in the economics politics history and sociology of their chosen area of the world and are grounded in international commerce finance accounting and marketing i expect to go to africa eventually says booker i think that after the sophisticated training of an european operation i could be very useful in africa his chances of getting there are good because his firm owns per cent of banque internationale pour iafrique occidental a company which operates offices in central and west africa b ooker robinson warren had already attended five universities including two in europe when he entered the american institute of foreign trade last year despite a heavy academic load in his first semester he worked hours a week at sperry rand corp to cover college costs totalling about since he had also acquired a wife eunicea ghanaian girl he met while studying at the university of marylands german branch in heidelberghe also had room and board expenses for two his only help was a tiny ayear scholarship robinson originally thought of spreading his graduate work out over three semesters but after deciding to graduate with his original class he stepped up his second semester course load to hours to acquire the hours necessary for graduation it was an expedient decision since his wifes earnings as a nurse in phoenix and a national defense education loan barely met their expenses then too his wife had a date with the stork we had put some money aside booker recalls but when the baby was bom

years bled the island of its one valuable resource it was the beginning of the end not only had the indefatigable chief deroburt wrung a nostrings vote for independence from naurus three un trust administrators hut he almost singlehandedly had raised phosphate royalties once a piddling halfpenny per ton to the current high purchased the remaining capital assets of bpc for million and set up an investment fund for his people that will totaua romping million years from now when the fertile fields of fertilizer are all worked out later that day i found tlie newly elected chairman of the council of state dressed in white shorts and shirt busily at work in his office the living room of the modest deroburt home before he could begin discussing the headaches that go with wealth and independence the phone rang its started already he sighed and while he settled his first state crisis his wife lukale brought tea our major problem he resumed was what to do with a vanishing islandrehabilitate or resettle elsewhere nauruans ha e li ed here from time immemorial we will not move away negotiations with scotland are underway for the purchase of a ship to bring in soil for the exca ated areas ls it true i asked that some youths believe independence has come too soon that the land will not support them that is a misconception he explained patiently the land produced trees and food before phosphate was reinoned and it will produce again furthermore we plan to establish industries a tuna fish cannerv has first consideration the island has no unemployment and very little illiteracy over nauruans are being trained to take over administrative jobs when the gov ernment assumes control of the mines in now only are employed by the bpc the remainder australians and new

their own schools but other races can attend them asked if the darkerskinned gilbertese who introduced liquor to nauru and other mictonesians who brought disease and the mostjuito can become citizens and own property the chief replied yes and they can hold office but none have our land cannot be sold or given away marriage to a nauruan can make one eligible to inherit property but such eligibility is not automatic nauruans are defined as mixed bloods but interracial marriage said my host is discouraged with all races except the white race they brought the guns with its higher standards of liv ing handicapped though it is by isolation uncertain rainfall and a oneindustry economy the infant nation is off to a debtfree start with money in the bank we have always been selfsupporting said chief deroburt proudly and we are not joining the un an association with other island communities will be far more meaningful for a nation as small and as remote as ours many had predicted it but few had expected it on thursday e ening of april the rev dr martin_luther_king jr a leader of black people and a crusader for the cause of humanity was killed by a single bullet that came crashing into his neck as he stood on the balcony of a motel in memphis tenn this nobel laureate who had consorted with kings and queens and who had been consulted by his nations presidents was dead at the age of ironically he had gone to that southern city to uphold the struggle of its striking garbage collectors the country that had spawned him and the world that had acclaimed him recoiled in horror prophet of peace in a time of trouhje dr martin luther kin jr became the impassioned voice of a people oppressed upholding the philosophy of nonviolence until death by a snipers bullet the burden and the glory he shared with his wife right coretta he had been a calm but impassioned presence in a time of cataclysmic trouble a fervent believer in an age of rampant skepticism it was the end of the road for this inspired man of the cloth who had devoted his life to the cause of his black brothers in his final speech in memphis less than hours before his death he had spelled out the two challenges to america racism and poverty and he had assured all who heard him that he had been to the mountaintop of hope and had seen a promised land where such things need not exist his death was not the end of that for which he stood i t was a warm december evening in montgomery ala where the segregationist codes of a defeated confederacy lingered in the daily life patterns of both black and white a lone negro woman took a seat near the front of a city bus and refused to obey the bus drivers order to move so that a white man might sit down her defiance of custom was one of those seemingly insignificant acts destined to alter history there was no plan to it all and later mrs rosa parks a seamstress and former secretary of the local naacp could only recall t was tired my feet hurt but her arrest called other forces into play black residents of montgomery were outraged by this flaunting of institutionalized injustice and turned to their leaders from their ranks there emerged one man exceptionally well prepared to accept a mandate he had not actively sought this was the rev dr martin_luther_king jr an erudite newcomer to the community and recently appointed pastor of the influential dexter avenue baptist church he was not yet years old king was privileged as few others of his race the son and grandson of ministers in atlanta ga he had been educated to the ultimate with degrees from morehouse college and crozer theological seminary and a phd from boston university comfort could have been his way of life but he was driven toward a cause leading to noble ends the resulting day bus boycott in montgomery led to a supreme court decision against that form of seating segregation black people throughout the nation began to take note of young dr_king and his methods of nonviolent protest his courage and restraint were to inspire a new juest for a freedom long deferred often he would proclaim his basic doctrine as he did in montgomery when he said if you will protest courageously and yet with dignity and christian love when history books are written in future generations the historians will have to pause and say there lived a great peoplea black peoplewho injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization this is our challenge and our overwhelming responsibility being black in america is a far different thini from being white in america as million of this countrys citizens well know dr martin_luther_king jr was able to articulate their cumulative experience to give voice to their spiraling sense of urgency when he was imprisoned in april for leading demonstrations in birmingham ala he answered eight white clergvtnen who had criticized his untimely acts with these words guess it is easy for those who ha e never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say wait but when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and dowm vour sisters and brothers at whim when vou have seen hatefilled policemen curse kick bnitalize and e en kill your black brothers and sisters when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your sixyearold daughter why she cant go to the amusement park that has just been adv ertised on television and sec tears w elling up in her little eyes when she is told that funtowai is closed to colored childrtn and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky and see her begin to distort her little personality by unconsciously de eloping a bitterness toward white people when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading white and colored when vour first name becomes nigger and your middle name becomes boy however old you are and when your wife and mother are never giv en the respected title mrs when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a negro liv ing constantly at tiptoe stance never quite knowing what to expect next and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments when you are forev er fighting a degenerating sense of nobodynessthen you wdll understand whv we find it difficult to wait n onviolence was his philosophy and passive resistance was his method from when dr martin_luther_king jr assumed the presidency of the southern christian leadership conference in atlanta he was to startle and befuddle a nation born and frequently sustained by violence his approach to the problem of attacking a racist society from within was steeped in the logic of his classical and religious training however he drew his greatest inspiration from indias martyred mohandas gandhi who had led his countrymen in their nonviolent reolt against the british in the light of gandhis teachings dr_king regarded the situation of the negro in america how could a minority comprising but per cent of a prosperous and powerful nation revolt against a system that consigned it to servitude without being annihilated black people possessed no weapons of war and did not control commerce in much of the south where he was to lead his greatest campaigns oppression was imbedded in the very laws that supposedly were designed to protect human rights america as a whole seemed to be committed to complacence his answer was a novel one to demonstrate peacefully against unjust laws and practices and to pay the price for doing so willingly to submit to the consequent indignities and to return love for hatred the calculated effect was to inflame his adversaries to the point of acting out the worst within themselves thus the plight of his people would be dramatized in the broader theater of the world he knew that america could not asord to present to other nations a facade of democracy and equality without confronting its racial hypocrisy hopefully the consciences of men might be stirred often his tactics worked they had worked in montgomery and they worked in birmingham la in the spring of there it was that eugene bull connor was projected as the embodiment of southern police brutality when in his role as police commissioner he authorized use of police dogs cattle prods and fire hoses against nonviolent demonstrators who had been trained to go limp when physically assaulted some criticized kings use of children in the front lines of those demonstrations but the impact was emphatic those who would hann children most certainly were less than human but it was only after four little girls were killed during the sunday morning bombing of a birmingham church that the nation reacted with the civil_rights act of they worked in selma ala too in early when king marched out his edict in a mile trek to montgomer leading a parade of celebrities and obscure followers past the dexter avenue baptist church where his journey to glory had begun it was a protest against dallas county white ofibcials exemplified by sheriff jim clark who refused to allow negroes tlie simple right to register and to vote alabama gov george wallace refused to see dr_king and his company of when they arrived in the capital mrs viola liuzzo a white woman from detroit was murdered after that march but the result of it all was the voting rights act of however there were other times when these methods did not work in when james meredith was shot early in the course of his solitary walk from memphis to jackson miss king moved in to hatescarred regions of the delta then it was that a new challenge was hurled to this civil_rights veteran by stokely carmichael the cry of black_power ushered in a new era king had asserted in that same year if every negro in america turns to violence ill still stand against it but there were others who were no longer willing to stand with him a t the foot of a gleaming monument erected for a man who had witnessed an earlier struggle for freedom more than modern pilgrims stood beneath a strangely benevolent sun the date was aug and they had come to the nations capital black and white together to lend visible support to president john f kennedys proposed civil_rights legislation chanting the movements anthem we shall overcome they had marched down the wide ribbon of constitution avenue in the most spectacular nonviolent demonstration this land had ever seen out of the quiet respect with which they regarded one another a hope began to blossom for one day it seemed that democracy might not be an impracticable ideology for one day it appeared that man might indeed be able to li e in peace with his brother of another color now the hopeful pilgrims paused before the lincoln memorial awaiting a message from a mail who could make words sine out with tlic magic of music a golden orator whose bra e actions gae imaning to ichas jr martin laither king jr rose and whorted all of amirica to share his dream of a better world his rich throbbing baritone rolled out ovr the sea of bodies before him ha e a dream that oik day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed vc hold these truths to be selfe ident that all men are created equal i ha e a dream that one dav on the red hills of giorgia the sons of former slaes and the sons of former slaeowners will be able to sit down togelhr at tht table of brotherhood have a dream that one dav even the state of mississippi a desert state sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice but he did not see his dream cometiue o ften the world ignores an exceptional human being when he appears on one of those rare occasions in history but martin_luther_king jr was not a prophet without honor humble black folk regarded him as their savior and their moses while many whites considered him one of the greatest men of the centuly after the monumental march on washington he was invited to speak in several european countries where he was accorded a heros welcome in he toured west germany and had an audience with pope paul vi shortly after his return to this country he was informed that he had been awarded the nobel prize for peace he was the third black man twelfth american and the youngest ierson ever to be so honored but even as he stood before an audience of dignitaries in oslo norway on dec he was true to his cause and to his commitment he said he did not consider the prize an honor to me personally but a tribute to those who sought to establish a reign of justice he donated his purse of b ack in before eminence overtook him and the course of his phenomenal career was just bejinninji to be set martin_luther_king jr stood in the pulpit of the church he pastored in montgomery ala and revealed to his congregation the totality of his commitment to a cause knowing that some members of his flock had been threatened because of the stand he had taken on the black bus boycott he fell to his knees and prayed if anyone should be killed let it be me his plea was prophetic and far from a mere histrionic outburst all along he had proclaimed that even death was not too great a price to pay for ones princixles throughout his life he abided by that belief sharing the suffering with those whom he had stirred to rise up against an unjust system though his words were eloquent his actions in behalf of his cause spoke far louder probably he did not know at the time of his death that be would not live to lead a poor peoples crusade intended to establish a lobby of the oppressed of all races in the nations capital it will have to go on without him but there are some who cling to mystical beliefs and contend that king was something a little more than human and knew that he was about to die it is a question no one can answer o ne of tlic nations top karate masters ijoldn of

relationships with african countries in light of the vicepresidents recent african tour and his own interests in winning friends for lxth the democratic party and the africanamerican institute krim thouglit why not have a party not only could he introduce the activities of the aai to his own associates and influential citizens but mr humphrey could informally describe the adventures of his african trip he did and found africans new yorkers and everyone else got along just splendidlyso splendidly that by am the group was still dancing enjoying the food and decor and having an internationally fine time h wer gay the party atmosphere serious discussion was also brought into the evening when vicepresident humphrey talked briefly about his african tour as african diplomats and tlieir ladies listened attentively mr humphrey explained how his trip had come about during a luncheon conversation with the president and several african friends mr johnson had asked what the united states could do to better africanainerican relations one african diplomat replied we would like the vice president to visit our continent and with that mr humphrey promptly began to schedule the trip

with african floral displays palm trees and handcarved statues and engaged the famed olatunji and his band to provide african rhythms by early morning as the last guests began to leave it was clear

either black or white none has more honestly earned the designation of a true man of peace than the late dr martin_luther_king jr without the slightest feeling of irreligiosity any thinking man today can accept the rev dr martin_luther_king jr as a prince of peace in a world more sorely troubled than at any other time in history now the prince of peace is dead a hidden assassin armed with a deadly weapon of war and the eye of a deerslayer slew the prince of peace with a single shot martin_luther_king died at on the evening of a bright spring day april no more will he link arms with those in the forefront of a phalanx of marchers for freedom no more will his oratory fill a church a hall a stadium in a fervent plea for peace and brotherhood throughout the world no more will he calmly suffer the cattle prods and clubs of arrogant police the jeers and insults of racist whites the jailings and beatings by county lawmen or the snide remarks of some fellow blacks who called him an uncle tom no more will he have a dream no more will he go to the mountaintop violent and final death came to this apostle of nonviolence in memphis tenn less than an hours flight from his home in atlanta ga dr_king had come to memphis to help those who needed his help and who had asked him for it they were fiittle peoplenegro garbage collectors who were striking for a living wage and improved working conditions they wanted to march on city hall in quest of their rights and nobody could lead a march as well as dr_king they did march in silent nonviolent protestbut dr_king was not there to lead them they marched on monday april the day before dr_kings funeral in atlanta it was quite fitting that dr_kings death came during a mission among little people a dozen years earlier he had begun his rise to fame during the montgomery bus boycott among the little people who sprang to the aid of rosa parks a seamstress who started the whole thing when she refused to move from the white section of a city bus she was just too tired to stand in the back after working for white folks all day during the short years of his career dr_king became one of the best known civil_rights leaders of all times he rose to such eminence that he shook hands wdth kings conferred with popes counseled presidents and defied mayors celebrities in all fields flocked to his support and his southern christian leadership conference became one of the most militant least violent civil_rights organization in u s history the world had its eyes on the negros struggle for equal rights in the u s and in dr_king was awaided the nobel prize for peace dr_kings cash award went to help finance the civil_rights movement he kept see opposite page the trophy the medal and the certificate as befits a leader dr_king consorted with kings but he never forgot his missionto help the poor the persecuted the deprived factory workers sharecroppers laborers the unemployed and the unemployables the church sister and the backslider all revered the man who had dedicated his life to helping the unfortunate and now that life is ended the violence the hate the looting and burning that spread across this nation after dr_kings death is something dr_king would have deplored just as he had deplored the violence that brought death to civil_rights workers medgar evers viola liuzzo michael schwerner james chaney andrew goodman the rev james reeb jimmie lee jackson and a host of others whose lives were snuffed out because they believed that all men are created equal if this violence on both sides continues then the death of dr_king will have been in vain if white against black nation against nation class against class is to be the way of the world in the future as it too often has been in the past then dr_king is the lucky one he will have to see and suffer it no longer we who are left will be the ones who live in tragedy the prince of peace is dead it is up to the millions who still live to see that his dream is brought to passt here was an air of inevitability about it first there was the rain then the snow then the blood blood called to blood and there was a convulsion of coasttocoast violence unprecedented in the civil history of america ten thousand plate glass windows were destroyed a thousand fires blazed federal troops were deployed to protect the white house and the u s capitol there was irony in this he was a man of peace and nonviolence and men women and children died in or against his name after the screams of agony after the smashing of idols after the purification of fire there was a funeral in a redbrick church smelling of chrysanthemums and lilies and the rhythmic benediction of a baptist cboir and out in the audience women in black their eyes red from weeping and the powerful and the famous sitting and standing shoulder to shoulder with the meek and the unknown it was a funeral the likes of which has never been seen in this land one has to go back more than ten decades back to the trax eling lincoln bier to find an analogue to the marching king casket and the rivers of people following his body in misery a halfmillion people were in and of and around this funeral tens of thousands filed past his bier weeping hundreds of tbousands followed the plain wagon and the two georgia mules which bore him to a second service amid the azaleas and the dogwoodthe crucifixion floweron the campus of his alma mater morehouse college late in tlie afternoon when the shadows were long on the new grass it ended for martin_luther_king jr in the silence of a crypt on a hillside in south view cemetery something within him had known that it would come to this to the chrvsanthemums and crowds and silence he had foreseen it all had thought about it the weight and the sound and the feel of his own funeralthe long lines and the tears and the immortal silence of a closed casket on the other side of the world something deep inside him knew but nothing inside him or outside him neither the snow nor the rain nor the thunder and lightning warned him against the specific web the spider of racism was spinning in the last days of his life vlien on lincolns birthday the garbage workers of memphis tennessee went out on strike he was far away deep in plans for tomorrows that would never come all that day february he sat in his atlanta office planning for april days he would not see two months before he had announced plans to go to washington to the seat of caesar with a poor peoples campaign and now on the day of the big strike in memphis he was closeted with aides in an allday strategy session in this meeting king and his aides made plans for every contingency save one they decided what they would do in washington if x did y and how they would respond if y did x they decided many things of moment but they did not decide what they would do about the garbage workers who were going out on strike now in memphis this strike grew out of an earlier decision which was made in the rain because of the rain which fell on memphis on january officials made a decision which would lead web by web to kings death they didnt plan it that way but a pattern of racism as old as the slave ships which brought kings ancestors to this country worked in them and through them it was this pattern which spun the first web of death it was this pattern which led memphis officials to separate the garbage collectors on the basis of race sending black workers home with two hours pay and keeping the white men for a full days work this dccision which would change so many lives which would lead to so many graves angered the black garbage collectors who held a meeting and decided to go out on strike the strike catalyzed the black community of memphis and sent ripples of red across the land the memphis strike did not immediately engage kings attention he was involved just then in a struggle for his very existence as a national leader although he was still the foremost symibol of the struggle for racial justice he was being pressed by a new breed of organizers and orators who stressed black_power and militant selfdefense more ominously his moral authority as a champion of nonviolence was being eroded by a new mood rising from the despair and determination of the very young and the ery defiant kings poor peoples campaign was designed in part to answer the critics and to re erse the drift toward violence in kings view the poor peoples campaign was going to be a htmus test for nonviolence it was going to prove once and for all whether nonviolence could attack the economic roots of racism and provide an alternative to rebellion and ruin and so while the garbage workers of memphis marched king crisscrossed tlie country seeking resources and bodies for the washington campaign as the calendar moved toward the ides of march king made a whirlwind peopletopeople pilgrimage which takes on new meaning in the light of subsequent events for what he did now with no inkling of the unfolding webs which were pulling him toward death was to make one last triumphant tour of the scenes of his greatest nonviolence campaigns on thursday night february he spoke in birmingham the scene of the massive demonstrations of the next morning friday february he spoke to a large and enthusiastic group in selma the focal point of the famous selmatomontgomery march that same afternoon he visited montgomery where thirteen years before he had begun his rise to worldwide acclaim this eerily prophetic journey into the past gave king new hope and he flew oflp to jamaica with his wife coretta and his aide andrew young for his final vacation by the time king returned to america the webs of fate were tightening the memphis garbage strike had moved from the periphery to the center of the civil_rights struggle and king decided to lead a mass march in memphis on march this march was postponed by a freak inch snowfall and on thursday march he returned to the city to lead a march of some protesters as it turned out this march vvas one of the major miscalculations of kings life for as he himself later admitted the march was poorly planned and insufficiently monitored worse king committed his name to a venture over which he had little control this became apparent soon after the march began young militants disdainful of kings methods broke away and started smashing windows and looting stores within a few minutes a fullscale riot was underway and national guardsmen were rushed to the city before the turbulence subsided one person had been killed and bad been injured king missed most of the excitement when the rioting began his aides fearful for his life pushed him into a passing car and sped to the rivermont motel on the banks of the mississippi here in a posh and deprcssingly white setting king who had less than a week to live spent what one of his associates later called the worst night of his life outside the rivermont men were saying that martin_luther_king jr the apostle of nonviolence had led a march that degenerated into violence some men were demanding immediate cancellation of the projected poor peoples campaign in washington others were saying that it was all over for king that history had passed him byinside the rivermont king studied the reports and lapsed into an intense depression which lasted his aides say for most of the last week of his life jesse jackson national director of operation breadbasket said some of us didnt understand and he was going through this extreme tension he was in the garden of gethsemane making a decision trying to see which way to go chaunccy eskridge kings tax consultant and personal advisor said he could agonize himself so he couldnt help feeling that agony riots depressed him and he would say that it was his fault he would ask himself am i doing any good rev ralph abernathy who was with king throughout that terrible night said later i had never seen him so depressed according to abernathy king spoke of the possibility of going on a personal retreat for meditation and reflection jesse jackson says king spoke of the possibility of imitating gandhi and going on a prolonged fast until black people abandoned violence and the stokelys and the raps and the youngs and the wilkins united king was still in a state of indecision and depression when he flew back to atlanta on the day after the riot rev abernathy kings constant companion and successor rode with him from the atlanta airport to the west side of atlanta when the car reached kings home on sunset avenue abernathy got out and tried to comfort his friend and leader he suggested a movie or a session at the health club of the butler street ymca king shook abernathy off he was in no mood for diversions ill pull out of it ralph abernathy recalls him saying i might call you later on later that night king and his wife dined at the abernathys they had an entree of pig ears and pig feet and a main course of kroker fish the soul food kings favorite revived his spirit and the two couples sat up until the wee hours of the morning whiling away the time the next day saturday march king called a staff meeting in the pastors study at ebenezer baptist church but he seemed somehow detached from the proceedings he sat on the edge of the group and at one point denounced the tensions and dissensions within the staff according to abernathy he said before we can go to washington something has to happen within this staff jesse jackson has a similar recollection of this crucial staff meeting i had never seen him under such a spiritual cloud before he says he talked with us and at one point he left the meeting because he didnt feel that the staff was as intellectually and as spiritually involved in the washington project as we should have been he was calling the roll just going around the room until he got all of us to feeling bad then he left abernathy followed king out of the meeting i didnt like the way he was acting abernathy says i was worried about him but he told me he would be all right and said again pull out of it ralph king pulled out of it and so did the staff within a few minutes the staff was caught up in an extraordinary emotional fers or which led to a number of concrete proposals the most important of these proposals was that it was necessary for dr_king to go to washington with the poor peoples campaign but that it was necessary for him to go by way of memphis this idea was relayed to king by staff members who told him that it was important for him to return to the meeting doc one staff member said the holy spirit is in this room king immediately returned to the meeting and decided to turn disaster into triumph by returning to memphis and proving that nonviolence was not dead he had at that point only five days to live at some point within these five days according to close associates he transcended the agony of doubt and reached a new plateau of understanding and acceptance the ordeal chauncey eskiidge says strengthened him jesse jackson says he made the decision after he saw the mountain there the mountain was there waiting on wednesday april when martin_luther_king jr returned to memphis to lead a second march he checked into room a aday double room at the lorraine moteland went into a series of conferences with lawyers and aides over a court injunction which forbade the march he was still conferring late that afternoon when a tornado roared over the city wind from the tornado ripped off roofs shook windows and sprayed the city with uncollected garbage rain came down in torrents a local radio personality regarded the natural disaster with distaste and said on the air maybe god is trying to tell us something the rain came down lightning rent the sky thunder spokeand men and institutions moved with the inexorabihty of a greek tragedy toward the eye of a national disaster somewhere in memphis at that moment national guardsmen who had been on duty since the riot were returning to their homes somewhere in memphis a white man or a group of white men were studying murder somewhere in memphis martin_luther_kings aides were recruiting nonviolent marshals for a march king would never lead at that moment king was regarding the rain with disquiet he was scheduled to speak at a mass meeting that night and his aides were advising him not to go the rain they reasoned would limit tlie crowd and if king spoke before an empty house reporters would write another spate of stories about the death of nonviolence king listened to the advisers and decided to send a substitute but a few minutes later ralph abemathy called king and told him that there were people in mason temple and that they wanted to see and hear him king put on his coat and went out into the driving rain to deliver the last speech of his life no one knows reallv what went on in his mind that night no one knows why he decided to talk about death but men sometimes know more than they know and the words which came deep from within king this night were words of death and it would seem twentyfour hours later that he knew precisely what was going to happen and why it was going to happen he had lived now for a long time in the shadow of death had the taste of it in his mouth there had been many attempts on his life and he knew that there would be others and he knew that someday somebody would succeed he had spoken of these things many times before to intimates now he said it out loud taking the audience into his confidence telling them about the mountains and the valleys the good days and the bad weve got some difficult days ahead he said but it really doesnt matter with me now because i e been to the nioiintuintop i wont mind like anybody i would like to li e a long life longevity lias its place but tin not ctincerned about that now i just want to do gods will and hes allowed me to go up to the inonntain and ine looked over and fve seen the promised land f may not get there with you but f want yon to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised fand so fm happy tonight im not fearing any man mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord king went out into the rain buoyed np by the cheers of thousands he spent almost all of the next daythursday april in his room challenging his staff to li e up to the principles of nonviolence while he talked the web tightened around him between and pm a white man slipped into a rooming house overlooking the motel lie had binoculars and a rifle he tmk np a position in the common bathroom facing room and waited when king emerged from his room to go to dinner he was centered in tlie crosshairs of the telescope sights of a highpowered rifle king tarried for a moment in the eye of death he leaned over the green railing and chatted with aides on the ground below ah he started to straighten np a shot rang out he fell backwards blood flowing from gaping wounds in his right jaw and neck there was an icy moment of silence then a woman screamed for all her life king lay on the concrete walkway his legs propped np on the railing his eyes wide open he did not speak and apparently he did not suffer the single bullet seered his spinal cord he died at in st josepbs hospital without regaining consciousness now began the rites of martyrdom the eulogies and memorials the riots and the tears now began the unprecedented tributes the postponement of the baseball season the shutting down of the docks the lowering of all u s flags to halfstaff now began the marches which extended from one end of the conntrv to the other and ended five days later when martin_luther_king jr was laid to rest in a cemetery green with new grass and the promise of new life

your disposal to tell em again and again what the black ministry really thinks of phony integration comes years too late to save a lot of white pastors the agony of seeing their congregations splintered and disintegrated by sunday brotherhood combined with the wellworn five oclock curtain where any meaningful social life is involved for either black or white brethren dogsthis sound like criticism of the white suburbanites whose station wagons loaded with bedding clothing and food were pulling up to the ghetto churches while the fires from the april riots were still burning not at all in a real hour of need they responded but the rest of the time they left the black congregations to their own destiny which is as mr poinsett afiirms what the blacks really wanted all the time joseph renshaw washington dc as a white anglosaxon united methodist i hang my head in shame at what white people have done to black people in this country and the fact that the churches have most often either acquiesced or at worst even blessed the status quo both during slavery and now adds to my shame however the picture is not all gloomy it was my upbringing in a white methodist church in north carolina which taught me the brotherhood of man that confronted me with the idea that racism is wrong it was a white methodist youth assembly in north carolina that gave me my first encounter w ilh a negro as a social equal rather a superior because he was pastor and teacher i also see that the white methodist church which i attended as a college student in knoxville tenn is now under the jurisdiction of a black united methodist bishop and the white united methodist church i now attend in pennsylvania is under the supervision of a llack district superintendent we arent hat we ought to be or even what we want to be but at least we arent where we used to be either by the way the new united in the name of the united methodist church signifies the merger of the former methodist and evangelical united brethren churches the ame and amez churches are not being ignored merger negotiations take longer when racial considerations are added to differences of size policy etc i for one felt that the united should not have been included in our name until the people called methodist in our country are truly united including ame amez and cme mary porter owen wallingford pa it seems as though the people in churches should only be dedicated to one common purpose to worship god i feel tliat no church is a place for petty issues concerning race i feel that we need to review the churchs purpose kaiu davis louisville miss excellent article on the black revolt in the white churches congratulations on a job superbly done charles v hamilton chairman political science dept roosevelt university chicago ill i enjoyed your article the black revolt in white churches however i must take exceition to alex poinsetts characterization of the roman cathohe church as ultraconservative now on many issues it would be fair to call tlie catholic church conscrvativceven ultraconservative it might even be fair to call it white racist in the sense that the average white catholic in america is about as bigoted as the average white protestant and in the sense that many unconscious racist assumptions have as tight a grip on many catholic institutions as on american institutions in general but let us remember that this church excommunicated six lay membersincluding a powerful southern politician for obstructing desegregation of its schools let us remember that an afroirishamerican patrick augustine healy became bishop of portland me in the first generation after the civil war let us remember that this church honors black men no black women strangely as saints lets not kid ourselves the racial liberalism of the catholic church in americaancl it cm be called liberal only compared to the average protestant denominations not the very progressive onesis due largely to the fact that its central leadership is not predominantly american the church universar keeps the church in america in line partly from principle and partly in response to nonwhite catholic leaders overseas but this hardly makes the church ultraconservative we miglit even say tlie catholic church is responsive to black pow er wielded by men like laurian cardinal rugwamba archbishop of daressalaam now if when pope paul dies cartlinal rugwamba is elected to succeed himwouldnt that blow some peoples minds william a hynes bronx ny arabs and slavery i as a black man and a consistent peruser of euony want your readers to know that i consider mrs doreen becker sept letters to the editor to be absolutely right for any black man to think of himself as being a natural ally of the arabs is comparable to the final thread of the screw being turned it is true that the rabs in kagne with the portuguese were the chief instigators and the main profiteers of tlie slave trade the tnes who set tribe against tribe in bloodv massacre and then sat back and collected the human debris the ones who rapetl and razed defenseless v illages enslav ing men women and children after slaughtering the aged infirm and those considered unsalable who bribed corrupt african chieftains vvith bits of colored glass cheap beads and cloth in return for wholesale lots of bl ack humanity indeed it was the arab w ho showed the w hite man what a fortune coidd be made in black flesh thereby opening up a new market for that comnuklity it was also the arabs and east indians up until the dawn of indepndence in almost all of the africaji countries w ho along with european colonial powers dominated the economy of these countries and at the th hour araks and indians almost in a loody began catching planes and boats back to their homeland knowing that the day of reckoning was coming witness the recent immigration laws set by england w luai the aribs uid indians started arriving at that country in bum lies heartbroken in the know hdge tliat their days of bloodsucking wre over it was the rigid caste system and the onesided everythinggoodgocstousrabs attittide of the arab government of mozambifjne that caused the africans after untold numbers of yeais of arab irrogmce to rise up enmasx and bal murder and drive tlum into the scm ridding themselves of the arabs forever do not see how anv black brother with even

several of the other articles understandably stressed conditions in the far east i dont know about the rest of asia but from my three years residence in japan im well aware that color bias there is no roundeye import the sad fact seems to be that color prejudice is nearly universal odd as it may seem to say so in these troubled days our own bullheaded shallowminded occasionally extremist certainly imperfect society has done as well as any other and better than the majority in really trying to overcome ethnic prejudices whether we can survive long enough until there is improeinent enough is

lewis apo san francisco calif compliments are the order of the day for your august special issue the black soldier tlie lack of black senior officers colonel and above has nothing to do with presentday recniitment difficulties prerequisite requirements for inline military and civilian educational development professional competence or any other necessary military attributes it has to do with a systematic wellestablished and tactfully administered policy which has existed at least since the days of the immortal col young in the u s army today black company grade officers lieutenants and captains to a limited degree are given significant assignments command and staff positions and receive tlie same military education as do their white contemporaries however tlie black officer is usually rated poorer on his rating sheet than the white officer by simple statistics it is clear that the rating officer is ahiiost abvays wliite providing tlic black captain has not been rated too low he has almost the same chance for promotion to field grade rank major and lieutenant colonel as does his white contemporary the promotion boards are also lily wliite but the black field grade officers assignment is very rarely significant he gets little if any command or important staff experience and his educational opportunities are stymied those few black officers that do attain the system notwithstanding senior rank and significant positions ahvajs seem to serve as someonts deputy it is important to note that in the military establishment with rare exceptions officers of general rank would liave had both significant command and staff assignments relating to their particular specialty and in addition woiild have had progressive educational development related to such experience gentlemen its the system and until it is changed the only black generals will have to be plilical ones thomas l cousin major artillery u s army reserve baltimore md proposes tax strike what would happen if every afroamerican w ithheld his or her annual income tax money until such time as the u s govemment takes more direct pasitivc action to grant us our full rights joan baez is a white woman who withholds her income tax money became of her opposition to tlve war in vietnam i too am opposed to war or violence of any kind but i do pay taxes so why can we not withhold our tax monies until the g s government ceases to drag its feet and take direct positive action to put an end to the cruelties of segregation and discrimination i propose such a mass boycott would be a powerful and effective in come to this perhaps it was too painful to admit to ourselves tliat blacks too can be so wicked to each other well it wont go away and unless some interest is shown towards these victims by us i am very much afraid their doom will be sealed the general attitude on the part of many people that by attempting to help starving people would involve interference into the internal affairs of an independent nation is ludicrous when one considers tlic many times nations have done just that and for far less noble reiisons the u s government did not hesitate to interfere with the berlin airlift and when a few hundred whites were being held hostage in stanleyville a few years ago they did not hesitate to launch a mercy mission to save them is it because these victims are black that they do not care very much i am appealing to you as an american of african descent and part of the black community of america to ask the u s government to launch the same kind of massive airlift of food to black people that we care about our fellow black mens plight no matter where tliey are or what the political implications may be we certainly would like to see black men cease this devastating war but giving aid to staring women and children cannot and should not he construed as taking sides in a political dispute we should he concerned primarily with the humanitarian aspect of this tragedy one need not get as involved as the afroamerican couple mr and mrs martin who lost their lives in an air crash carrying food in order to give concrete help despite warnings from the nigerian government that they would shoot down any plane not cleared by them all that is asked is your help in alerting our government to our fervent desire to save our starving suffering african brethren

something like that for two years now hut not enough of them have moved from rhetoric to action one of the outstanding exceptions is a philadelphia black man the rev leon sullivan who has been taking the black powcr challenge seriously and turning it to good account the latest product of his eiforts is progress aerospace enterprises incorporated only in may as one of the few blackow iied aerospaee firms in the united states the firm grew out of rev sullivans belief that the aerospace industry wdll continue to boom for years to come we wanted to show that black men are capable of handling the most sophisticated kind of business operations he explains anticipating a continuing increase in space and moon explorations he adds i want black americans to be a part of this future hope that when this country finally lands a man on the moon pae will hae made parts of the space craft pe not only provides the aerospace industry with strategic parts but also such important seriees as the calibration of electronic test eciuipment mttal cleaning sheet metal and wood fa ricatioii and the fabrication of electronic and electrical harnesses cables electronic modules aerospace ground equipment and instrumentation the new company has gotten off to a hopeful start with worth of contracts from the general electric co or enough to insure paes operations for the next several years other pending contracts may force pae to expand its x square footage within three years meanwhile the us dept of labor in conjunction with the national alliance of businessmen has awarded pae a contract to train hardcore unemployablcs from this group come most of the firms skilled workers we have to take these people and make aerospace technicians out of them explains plant manager benjamin w sallard trainees who attend allday classes are groomed for jobs ranging from resistance welders and sheet metal mechanics to component testers and harness fabricators out of the training program pae has developed a work force so far of si employes paes employe training program is an outgrowth of the operations industrialization center which rev sullivan heads for five years the center has been training people in electronics for other companies he recalls i suddenly realized that if we could train skilled workers for others we could also train tliem to work for us thats why we had no doubts about finding people to work in the plant all of paes employes are cleared by the defense dept because of the national security importance of their work the firm has an impressive array of managerial talentmen who previously held top positions at general electric and gave up ge security for a pe gamble that is paying off their attitude is typified by sallard who recalls after two meetings with the ery persuasive rev sullivan and a talk with my wife i decided to accept the position i knew i would kick myself if i didnt gi e it a try so far sallard and rev sullivan are pleased with each other one of the keys to the eventual success of pae is finding the right man to run the plant the minister says ben sallard is that man he is one of the most brilliant young men have ever met another key staffer is carl m ashe paes manager of juality assurance and the firms chief security officer he is confident of his companys eventual success because companies iti our area who need the kind of work we will be doing have had to go to daytona beach fla or california to have it done the initial funding for pae came from more than of the members of rev sullivans zion baptist church six years ago these investors had pledged to put aside a month for months to finance shopping centers housing projects and business enterprises the plan has contributed to the initial financing of a milliondollar housing complex named zion gardens the million progress plaza shopping center and the recently opened progress garment manufacturing co thus progress aerospace enterprises turns out to be an example of how black people pooling their resources can help themselves whatever movie audieices might discover when they pile into theaters this fall to see the new hollywood shocker u p tight it will not be another guess wbos coming to dinner a film that just a year ago was considered quite daring but which now doesnt even seem to deal with the issue following the kaleidoscpic changes of americas social pattern the motion picture industry runs the same risk as white america itselfdoing too little too late but in up tight the movies tr to take a dramatic leap into the present it is a now film not only does up tight deal with big city ghetto unrest it also presents a black antihero the likes of whom has never before been seen on the american screen in the role of the antihero author julian mayfield returns to his first love acting in addition to being one of three scriptwriters on the film he plays tank a frustrated black man who unable to find his own path in the racial stniggle and castrated by his inability to prov ide for the woman he lov es sells out his best friend and destroys his own soul mayfield sets an entirely new image of a black leading man he does not have the boyish innocence of sidney poitier he is not haiidsome like harry belafonte his hair is bushy his eyes are large and fierce his face is grizzly and his clothes are unkempt the image is big black and burly he isin a word everynigger moreover what mayfield says and does on the screen may be just as frightening to white america as his appearance for instance in an amusement park scene with trick mirrors heightening the bizarre effect he gives a wellmeaning but niiive group of white onlookers an exaggerated glimpse of what their world would be like after a black takeover vp tight produced and directed for paramount pictures by jules dassin who presented the memorable never on sundatj and rififit represents dassins first hollywood effort in nearly years it is perhaps odd that both dassin and mayfield have returned to the u s after selfimposed exilesofasort each for political activitv to make such a film in the beginning the paramount film was to be a kind of remake of a john ford flick the informer but dassin decided to give it a black slant and cast explains dassin it was something i had wanted to do for a number of years but i couldnt quite pull it together then somebody asked me if i woidd base it on the informer and i said id try the resemblance is uite remote dassin wrote a first draft and then invited ossie davis and rubv dee to dinner to discuss it davis a brilliant writer as well as actor had too many commitments to participate in the project so dassin enlisted miss dees help not only as an actress but as a writer as well ruby has very strong poetic talent says dassin her sense of images her sense of sound is just marvelous it was a very full and rewarding collaboration mayfield joined the project later he had been attending a black writers conference at fisk university where he delivered a speech that appealed to visiting actor frank silvera we parted at the airport and i didnt expect to see him again for a couple of years mayfield recalls but soon frank telephoned and said dassin was working on a project and i might help i thought of coming down to sec if i could get a writing assignment three days later i was working in cleveland dassin was impressed not only with mayfield as a writer but with his physical attributes and acting experience as a possibility for one of the male leads tank much of up tight was filmed in the tough hough district of cleveland which has been the scene of some violence in fact the very conference room in which final agreement was reached to make the movie was almost the scene of violence dassin had explained his story idea to studio executies and then been called away to the phone when he returned to the room it was announced that the studio would not make the picture i spoke for minutes says the seemingly mildmannered dassin i dont know what i said i just remember being angry and convincing at the end of his speech says dassin the top studio executive arose and said im crazy but well do it the studio is crazy to the tune of an estimated for a film that runs nearly two hours on the screen mayfield a onetime political activist who left the u s in after the monroe n c riots feels that while up tight is not the end in terms of ultimate blackwhite reality on the screen it is at least a creditable beginning the story deals with a man who has betrayed his companions says mayfield you might not want to start there but working within that framework we have had complete freedom to do what we want to do i think weve got some new people here not as personalities but new black people and i think they arc very exciting to watch no matter what happens i dont feel this will be a film we will be ashamed of just seeing certain images on the screen will be so new it will blow the minds of many people black and white to see what is going on in this country t he tvvo youngstersone black one whiteare playing in smallboy fashion when a neighbor walks by hi says the white lad whos your friend asks the neighbor this is my friend corey comes the reply hes colored yes muses the neighbor looking at corey well i guess it runs in his family that family has now been introduced to millions on the nations tv screens in a historic television firstnbcs julia a situation comedy starring diahann carroll as a registered nurse who is rearing her sixyearold son in a large city after her husband an air force captain was shot down and killed over vietnam meant to be both amusing and touching the story projects a somewhat fictionalized eveiyday living pattern of middle class negroes in an integrated middle class environment to the ghetto negro who despite his poverty has vast telev ision reception this may not be telling it like it is but for television it is showing it like it has never been shown before and for this nbc diahann carroll and executive producer hal kanter julws creator are both thankful and hopeful says miss carroll id like a couple of million of them white americans to watch and say hey so thats what they do when they go home at night for television a series about a black family with a negro female as star has been a long time coming and for nbc it is a far cry from when the network tried unsuccessfullv for more than a vear to find a national sponsor for a weekly musical show starring the late nat king cole julia has three sponsors for its tuesday night halfhoursgeneral foods mattell inc toymakors and menley james laboratories a pharmaceutical firm as a slice of black americana julia does not explode on the tv screen with the impact of a ghetto riot it is not that kind of show since the networks have had a rash of shows dealing with the nations racial problems the lighthearted julia provides welcome relief if indeed relief is even acceptable in these troubled times although hal kanter one of the foremost writing talents in holly wood believes that the time has come to try to present negro life on the air he has some feelings about how he personally would like to do it you dont want to see agony poxerty and despair week after week says kanter thats not entertainment kanters own involvement occurred after he attended a luncheon honoring naacp leader roy wilkins greatly impressed with what he later recalled as wilkins calm objective appraisal of what was happening in america the writer was then faced with determining the nature of his own response obviously you write a check says kanter but thats not enough theres got to be compassion concern awareness kanter says he asked himself how can i employ what skills i have as a creativ e person his answer to that was a television script which he sent off to his agent who described it as the best thing yoirve ever done and nbc liked it immediately as a series idea kanter rev eals that the ultimate number of negroes who will appear in the julia series although there are few in the first few scripts and the opportunities which will result for black people in the industry is the most exciting aspect of the project to him already four black writers have done shows for the series thev are liobcrt goodwin harry dolan gene boland and ferdinand leon f or diahann carroll the advent of julia brings a marked change to her already superlative career a recognized talent since the age of she has been a star of night clubs motion pictures and broadway and julia in a sense symbolizes a slowing down of her dazzling personal pace it also means says miss carroll less money but then she consoles herself theres less money coming out of ones salary for travel and musicians and doctors there is also something very attractive about being able to come home eery evening for all its merits as a television first julia has drawn some criticism for not projecting a male headofthefamily image for black audiences andamong the more unreconcilable militantsfor showing julia and son leading a happily integrated life among middle class whites miss carroll howecr makes her own argument to the contrary however julia is presented she says she represents another and more realistic evolution purely because of the circumstances of her existence she has her faults but julia is still quite special in that shes bright and curious i identify very much with julia the mere presentation of negroes on motion picture and television screens in an evergrowing variety of situations is important according to miss carroll who says of the current trend black children are going to hae a marvelous time now their selfimage is going to be so much greater nevertheless she belie es that the portrayal of adult manwoman relationships between black people is perhaps the most meaningful contribution to be made by the entertainment media she likes for instance her latest movie role opposite jim brown in which she plays the estranged wife of a criminal in the tradition of the sexy s the scenario calls for the inevitable spicy bedroom scene im always fascinated says miss carroll when a script includes love scenes and the difficulty of manwoman relationships between black people because normally we see so little of it in films as much as we are a sexual image there is very little sexuality between us on the serten but the actress believes that the importance of such a relationship goes far beyond the simple need to have it projected for american audiences it is a matter that should be of deep study for black people themselves observes miss carroll the negro males masculinity has been and is being ripped away daily and it is most certainly the responsibility of the female to see where the wounds are and to heal them if she doesnt shes tlie loser and shes tlie loser in all areas of their relationship julia does not deal with such ierceptive insight into the american negro phenomena as the star of the scries displays the show is after all television comedy even as such it will have good moments such as when coreys friend spies miss carroll and asks if she is coreys mother when corey tells him she is his white friend observes you know what your mothers colored sure says corey so am i heplies the friend you are there is another script where a white nurse is dressing julia down for showing lack of interest in a male says the nurse ml right if thats your attitude when the next tall dark handsome fellow walks into this office i wont even call your attention to him says julia fine if hes tall and handsome but if hes dark at least give me a shot at him this fall between and television stations are carrying julia including such southern outlets as houston atlanta richmond roanoke and jackson i wish it nins for five years exclaimed miss carroll during a birthday party in her honor on the set wrote los angeles tv critic hal humphrey later if its good enougli i hope it does too bccause color tv needs the extra color i n the red glow of the afternoon sun he stands long stringbean lean and poised like a cocked trigger in his hand is an ovalshaped piece of wood with a handle and with it if you are his opponent arthur ashe jr will beat your brains out it is a classic story in a game that was once the exclusive province of the ladies and gentlemen who dwell in the elegance of white anglosaxonprotestant country clubs a yearold negro from richmond va now stands as the best in the united states this year while on a tour of dutv as an anny lieutenant ashe won the u s amateur tennis championship and the first u s tennis open in historyin which some of the worlds top professional players were shot down within days after the u s open win ashe was on the cover of life magazine was toasted in las vegas became the first athlete to ever appear on the cbs face the nation television show was a contestant on abctvs dating game and a guest on the joey bishop show for a little black boy from richmond to have done all this via tennis is to have tra eled a long long road today arthur ashe stands as the ranking young black sports idol baseball and football stars are a dime a dozen wilt chamberlain and bill russell are approaching the threshold of antiquity tlie heavyweight boxing championship of the world in which once reposed the object of youthful black adoration is in chaos thus unparalleled success has taken king arthuras his close tennis associates now refer to himto a lofty if lonely pinnacle holding trophyi ashe relishes victory which gave him mens singles title in u s opeti tennis championship in scpteinhcr it is not an easy place for arthur ashe to be the son of a recreation park special policeman he received the kind of upbringing that many a young southern black boy gets be neat and clean work hard mind your manners and dont cause trouble for arthur ashe jr supreme and unquestioned authority rested in arthur ashe sr arthurs mother died in when he was only six and the lonely young boy found fun and companionship on the brook field tennis courts barelv feet from the house in which he lived with his father and younger brother johnny at the age of seven arthur was not much bigger than his tennis racquet and indeed he had to hurl himself racquet and all at the ball to hit it back across the net but by the time he was he was traveling in the south and winning tournaments ronald charity a young recreation worker gave the youth his first tennis instruction and later took him to tennis buff and mentor r walter johnson a lynchburg physician dr johnson ran a summer training camp for promising young players and arthur spent seven seasons there working on his tennis watering dr johnsons flowers and cleaning up after his hunting dogs that was the worst arthur remembers of cleaning the dog house with lye but arthur learned his tennis larncd it in fact too well for to be a black tennis player in the south posed problems once arthurs court skills surpassed those of his negro home court competitors he had no where else to go existing segregation laws kept him from playing richmoners white tennis players years later though the city got around to honoring the young tennis star it once snubbed richmond preferred to drain its swimming pools rather than integrate them as required by a new law now needing more severe tests of his abilities arthur was sent off to st louis and the home of school teacher richard hudliii there he was able tn take advantage of the indoor tennis courts and yearround play iludliu like those before him kept a nononsense eye on arthur bedtime is at oclock he told the high school senior and that includes friday and saturday nights arthur oeally resisted the edict you came here to play tennis hudlin insisted and thats what youre going to do arthur played tennis in fact the youngster played so well that he won the u s lawn tennis assn junior singles indoor tournament establishing himself as the best player in the country under meanwhile tennis coach j d morgan at ucla took a liking to arthur and arthur liked ucla tennis at ucla ashe moved up the ladder to the no spot on the college team and suddenly he was a name to watch he won the national clay courts championship in chicago at the age of moed from a no national ranking in amateur tennis in to the no spot in while on a world basis he was ranked th meanwhile he made history as the first negro member ever named to the davis cup team as his fame increased tennis soon began to mean more to arthur than simply playing the game he became involved in the social life of the circuitdances and dinners and parties perhaps because he is handsome educated articulate and most often the lone negro his acceptance oft the court has been almost total i sometimes wonder he remarked recently what things would be like if the davis cup team had all black players except one or if the tennis world in general had or of us which would still be a minority and we were all top players i imagine its very easy to tolerate me if someone is a marginal case of bigotorliberal he says aw its just one guy we can take care of him its no sweat thus in a nonteam sport with no other black star arthur ashe is the whole black race as such the image he casts is now of interest to whites and blacks alike in the early days black militancy was not his bag im not the crusader type he wrote two years ago in his book advantage ashe i pay my yearly dues in the naacp and tend to my tennis a different arthur ashe speaks today however one who admits his attitude on his responsibilities in the cause of black justice has changed its changed mostly because im older and wiser he explains then theres outside pressures what was liberal five years ago may be moderate now the definitions have changed im sure that years from now what is liberal today will be moderate then just as what was liberal years ago is conserv atiye now ashe sees himself as definitely more militant today and believes that his old idea of simply achieving as much as one can individually and setting an example is not enough for one thing he plans to work for the urban league follow iug his military discharge in february he will most likely work with young people but says ill probably leave it up to wliitney young whatever he wants me to do at the same time there is a lot of tennis to be played and hell probably launch a highpaying professional tennis career he would like to win the viinbldoii frtuch and australian titles and the davis cup hed also like to win the u s national indoors championship then would hae won every major title here in the u s he explains theres a lot of luck iinolvcd in winning a touniament the tennis champion says knowingly id say that the three main factorsunless youre head and shoulders above the fieldare luck conditioning and determination but determination is worthless by itself because a man can get nowhere without the other two thus weightv lies the crown on king arthurs brow but life for the royal class has never been all bad in his part of the tennis world the food is good black servants at the plush clubs and hotels often give him preferred cuts of steak extra servings special ser ice the accommodations are comfortable and the girls are plentiful and while arthurs sense of restraint prevents his qualifying as a playboy he would never discriminate against a girl because of race color or creed off the court as well as on arthur is known as a man who keeps his cool but even for a man of restraint the pleasures are considerable after the glory of winning the open at forest hills arthur and his davis cup teammates moved on to the desert inn in las vegas where they played exhibition style tennis by day and then hung themselves out into the night and la ished their substance on the fleshpots of the gambling scene from there arthur moved on to los angeles international airjort where a chauffeured cadillac limousine dispatched by entertainer bill cosby awaited his command arthur eased himself inside and glided off into the velvety blue of the california night he never lost his cool i ts only a little song about the pain of being black and poor about haing no food on iny table no shoes on my feet and such things but james cleveland stands there on the apollo theater stage in harlem and sings the words and has people rocking in their seats and a few doing the holy dance up and down the aisles lord do it is what the song is called and the words have special meaning there in harlem where most folks reckon that just about the only one who can ease the blackpoor pain is the one they learned about back home down souththe lord james cleveland sings as if he agrees and he squeezes the mike and tightens up his face and his whole body shakes as he shouts the words that get to the people lord do it today this kind of singing this kind of rocking and holydancing is gospel and the man getting to the people is one whom gospel fans call king james for these fans jamts cleveland is well you know tlu oiu setting the whole pace in gospel today he is they say not just a gospel singer hes all around he does ev erything in the gospel field cleveland can indeed do lots more than sing he has written some gospel songs and dozens of them are today as standard in some churches as the old great hymns hes also a master pianist he taught iretha franklin much of what she knows about piano an arranger who draw s even pop and jazz artists to workshops at his los angeles home a choir director good enough to put together a voice choir within a few days after arrival in almost any town and a recording star with or so bigseller albums on the racks a few months ago word went out that his gospel music workshop of america would meet for the first time in detroit in came delegates from states and all had come to learn something from king james g ospel music is no longer the looked down on hipslapping music of the untrained church choirthe music merely tolerated by anthem singers whod snicker when the gospel beat began and cringe when a gospel singer threw back her head and sang how i got over it is a music that has progressed from the simple lyrics and elemental harmonies of years ago to todays words and choral arrangements good enough to stand up against just about anything that oliver nelson and fred waring can turn out today gospel is acceptable so much so tliat mahalia jackson has become wealthy from it clara ward sings it on the las vtgas strip half a dozen record companies depend on it for profits and a philadelphia fellow named marvin bunton is able to publish the gospel news journal which has coasttocoast sales two years ago james cleveland took gospel to paris appearing with his james cle eland singers at the celebrated theatre olympia for nearly two weeks he had frenchmen each night on the verge of the holy dance then he traveled to monaco for command performances before prince rainier and princess grace news of the european successes made cleeland an even bigger star back home now he can demand x for an appearance and bookings are a year in advance though he wont talk about his earnings thats for me and the income tax man to know cleveland is the highest paid male gospel singer in the business i know how much hes making but im not telling it either says one of the singers business pals but can hint to you that james thinks only in six figures these days as for his record sales cleveland has been awarded three gold records and fred mendelsohn of savoy records says everything he records will sell even his new releases sell more than what we can expect from the complete sale of any of our other artists why do you know the album thats our biggest seller right now its peace be still and cleveland recorded that five years ago cleveland is savoys highestpaid recording starthe company also has such groups as the roberta martin singers the southwest michigan state choir the caravans the davis sisters the rosie wallace choir and soloist jessye dixonand he has something else thats considered rather special in the industry while most record artists work against sales royalties cleveland receives a guaranteed annual salary under contract terms requiring him to record four albums a year the guaranteed annual salary is hints mendelsohn far from small he and savoy have simply agreed on a certain figure mendelsohn says and he knows that every three months liis check is in the mail hes probably the only gospel artist around who has that kind of deal well maybe mahalia jackson has something similar but as far as we know clevelands the only one thats how big james cleveland is c leland now lives in a spanishstyle house on quiet garthvvaite avenue in los angeles there are a housekeeper a cook a valet a secretary a japanese gardener and a boy who keeps the cadillac clean the house is filled with things that cleveland went right downtown and picked out myself wallpaper with velour designs that pick up the bright red of the carpet velvet sofas and chairs and carrara marble tables throughout in the dining room a czechoslovakian crxstal chandelier and a wallwide breakfront loaded with french saon china and goldedged stemware and upstairs in cedarlined closets about suits pairs of shoes and a persian lamb overcoat i had it made by the best furrier in chicago the house is a lot different from the drear one in which cleveland was born on chicagos south side years ago he grew up there in chicago knowing and pestering such gospel greats as mahalia jackson roberta martin thomas a dorsey and the late theodore frye i was mahalias paper boy he recalls and id go over to her apartment on indiana avenue and leave her paper and then put my ear to the door to tr to hear her singing if she wasnt at home id go over to her beauty shopshe used to be a hairdresser you knowand just sit around there and listen to her hum songs while she was straightening hair i grew up completely fascinated by mahalia jackson and we get together sometimes now and laugh about how i used to follow her around town wherever she was singing cleveland grew up he says in the gospel atmospherelearning songs from mahalia jackson and the others copying roberta martins piano style note for note chord for chord and learning songwriting and arranging by working with such groups as the old thome gospel crusaders and the beatrice lux singers it was mr dorsey who gave me my first chance to sing in public cleveland says he was at pilgrim baptist in chicago then and that was my grandmothers church i was sort of a mascot for the choir and id sing louder than anybody else mr dorsey heard me and put me up on a box and let me suig a song called hes all i need oh i was about eight years old then and had a beautiful boy soprano voice later on i sang so loud and so hard that i strained my voice thats why it sounds like a fog horn now lots of folks call me the louis armstrong of gospel you know it took cleveland years of paying my duesplaying for the caravans singing with the mahalia jackson singers the gospelaires and the gospel chimes directing church choirs in chicago and detroit preaching as a licensed minister in the church of god in christ and he says seeing little success and no money at allbefore he moved to los angeles and formed the james cleveland singers about five years ago since then all the success has rolled in which is just a little more proof says james cleveland pioting a popular gospel song that if you hold out deliverance will come itll surely come w iiat docs a toothache have to do with two plus two equaling four about as much as a child who needs glasses struggling with reading or a child who needs a psychologist stuttering through diction lessons toothaches poor eyesight emotional disturbancesall hinder effective academic learning at least that is part of the philosophy underlying a new laboratory school in a densely populated neighborhood of miami fla it has been cited as a promising answer to the problems of disadvantaged children in the fourtoseven years age group called the centerette and completed in january with nearly a half million dollars of mostly federal funds the school starts on the premise that most disadvantaged children are unable to achieve their academic potential because of inadequate nutrition poor health shattered families and a host of other nonacademic reasons therefore the centerette regularly schedules its students for medical and dental care in its clinics in addition a school psychologist works with a visiting teachercounselor and a childdevelopment specialist to identify the childrens problems and take steps to solve them the school serves morning snacks and prov ides a hot tray lunch for ev eryone at noon but equally important in the centerettes approach to education is its loose structuring of the curriculum students are div ided into four separate groups each with an instructional center equipped for the total educational needs of the group each instructional poda squarefoot roomis assigned three ccrtifid teachers a teacher aide and a teacher corps intern each airconditioned pod houses up to pupils in a setting that contains all the comforts of a middle class or uppermiddle class home including bathtub shower liv ing room dining room kitchen window drapes carpets fulllength mirrors on the wallsin short conveniences which are lacking in many of the childrens homes although each family spends most of its time in its pod there is some crossgrouping between pods groupings are by age by interests sometimes by lack of interest academic abilities and social characteristics the basic curriculum is designed to provide an individual program of instruction for each student thus enabling each to work independently at his own rate in the manner most conducive to his own style of learning instruction is flexible and involves games developed by teachers and the director tv films books tapes and field tripsno textbooks or readers as many as instnictional goals have been defined at the centerette data on pupil and teacher performance is being fed into a computer to keep track of each students intellectual and emotional development changes in his learningstyle and the appropriate teaching methods to match these changes the centerette strives to involve the entire community the visiting teachercounselor directly involves parents in their childrens learning problems although the regular school day ends at pm children whose parents work are permitted to remain at school until from pm until pm a community school is available to parents wanting to earn a high school diploma the parent community citizens council plans such activities as courses in english modern math journalism psychology andat the high schooldriver education sewing typing and scout leadership frankly experimental and one of the newest efforts in the academic world to investigate experiment and evaluate various curricula materials styles of teaching and learning and inservice programs for professional growth the centerette has beimi cited by a us senate committee as an excellent use of federal funds nevertheless there is still some question as to whether the experiment will work whether it is possibleor even desirableto program disadvantaged children into carlx copies of their middle class peers one official at the centerette stresses the schools emphasis on developing selfconcept at a sense of somebodiness in the children but whether the school can successfully overcome the damaging stigmas placed on its black children by the larger society remains to be seen the first group of children to leave the school entered the third grade at the more traditional school this fall they had been in the centerettes program only one term it remains to be seen whether the headstart they presumably received will not be negated by their return to the real world of inferior schools and indifferent teachers d etroit mich of automobile fame has seen many parties in its time but few will be remembered as vividly in the black community as those recently hosted by the gordy family of motown records during the first week of september the burgeoning gordy

of the personable jurist are encouraged by the fact that he recently purchased a home in agana on the island of guam they hope that it is an indication that he intends to stick around for quite a while i n the life of oliver nelson there is little reminiscent of the traditionally dusky jazz world as a toprated arrangercomposercondiictor and irtiioso reedman he does not haw to rel on onenight stands or gigs in the countless smoky rooms where noise occludes the music no legends of personal misery surround him for he lias neer been a junkie or had to fight for a cabaret card in order to make his bread in his owm way he has paid his dues as any serious artist must but his path has not led down deadend streets toward apparent suffering and premature death instead he lives in an impressive room house with swimming pool in los angeles plush view park section and writes liis music in a spacious sunlit studio overlooking the palmlined streets of the city he stands to earn more than from uniersal studios this year as composer of background music for the popular telex ision seris ironside royalties from the lp records on which he has presented both his own compositions and original arrangements for otliers will assure him several thousand more for all of this music is tighlly controlled by his own noslen music publishing firm in an unlikely pinch he can always teach or depend on income from his textbook on jazz improvisation patterns for saxophoncy which he prints and distributes by mail order from his home he is hardly hurtin at he is near the top of the musical heap an olixer nelson credit is considered a mark of distinction on a record jaekit and there are few major artists in the jazz and xop fields xvith xvhom he has not workedfrom the temptatitns jimmy rushing

celebrities he and his piece band assembled for the oeeasion xvre introduced by stan kenton and drew the praise of arrangercomxoosers like neal hefti and henrv mancini and yet with all this olixer nelson is not entirely haxxy he fears that he might become a victim of his oxxii success for there is the constant lure of the even bigger money to be made by those xvho join he club as that small group of openly commercial but highly solvent hollywood composers call themselves club type success is difficult to shun xarticularly when oliver enjoys living as he does he likes his big house though he has few spare hours to splash around in his own pool and is equally proud of the home and acre tract he has purchased for his parents on the outskirts of his hometown st louis he reluctantly admits i dont see how i could give it all up but realizes that his expanding activities have left him little time in which to write music freelv to answer what he calls this inner voice something inside that just has to come out all along he has been a man of two musical worlds drawing from each of them to create a hybrid sort of music that can not easily be categorized as a saxman he has been playing jazz ever since boyhood and earned his spurs as arrangercomposer with greats like duke ellington count basie and quincy jones his contemporary however he has combined this with his thorough formal trainingfour years majoring in composition and theory at washington university in st louis with further studies at lincoln university in jellerson city private studies with men like dr hubert wykes george tremblay and elliott carter the pulitzer prizewinning american composer out of this second side of his musical self he has written formal works for woodwinds chamber orchestra and other instrumental groupings that have been performed both in this country and in europe two of his orchestral works were commissioned by radio stuttgart and xresented in germany during and this year the american wind symxhony under the direction of robert boudreau xresented a special tribute to oliv er nelson ing three of his serious works along with other contemiorary and exixmimental music during its series of concerts throughout the ohio river alley few black comioosers have been so honored and with the exeextion of ellington socalled jazz comxosers have not been so acknowledged there are sev eral parallels between nelson and the duke of whom he is considered by many to be heir aiparent both have a deep commitment to their work as comxoosers though nelson stands in awe of the master because duke did it without the fonnal training both xnefer the big band as their instrument using unusual harmonies and xrogressions writing tightly but leaving space for display of soloists ellington was the first jazz comimser to be nominated for a sxecial pulitzer prize an honor that was withheld bv columbia univcrsit which controls the xxize in a nelson comimsition for xyloxdione vibes and marimba was nominated for a pulitzer without disaxxointment oliver laughingly explains naturally it didnt get it this formal aspect of nelsons musical personality has influenced his jazz and xopular work it has led some black bulls to criticize his music on the grounds tliat it sounds too white a matter that dcnqiy disturbs him for along with the struggle to steer clear of rank commercialism he has been engaged in a more intimate xursuit of his true musical identity now he believes he has found it that lu has eseaxed a major danger what has haxpened with the negro coinxmser who decides to become a serious musician nelson explains is that he ends sounding like a white comioser this is because they havent known who they were didnt for a long time because my teachers were trying to make a white composer out of me but now i believ e im a stex ahead of them lor as a trained black com poscr i can write eerything from a symphony to rock roll while they cannot indeed he can write the blues or a baroque fugue and has experimented with electronic music he digs bela bartok but will quickly acknowledge that b b king is so damned valid of his work he says i suppose tm an eclectic for i absorb from all sources and somehow the ethnic sources seem to be coming through stronger which is the way it should be olivers training began at the age of six when he was encouraged by his mother and an older sister both named lucille to take piano lessons music came easily to him news of his natural talents soon spread beyond the family and as a neighborhood child prodigy he performed at community teas and programs to this day he is grateful for the sacrifices his family made in order that his talent might deelop to his mother who encouraged him his sister who had a modest collection of classical records and particularly to his father eugene a pullman porter who used to walk to work so that there might be enough money for olivers music lessons in the beginning there were the usual and sometimes painful doses of mozart and beethoven pounded out on the piano but at the age of oliver found his true instrument when he turned to the saxophone first the alto later the tenor and other related reed instruments by the time he was he was playing alto sax professionally with local bands his sober but lenient parents did not discourage him though they suggested look we dont want you to grow up in a life of music because it means bars and cigarettes and whisky and loose women he kept on playing but remembers one night my dad who does not drink or smoke had a feeling about me i was about and working not because i had to support my family but because i was good on alto sax my dad walked the blocks over to where i was playing and there they were shooting in this joint and everyone was ducking and carrying on and i was hiding behind the idiano he got me out of that place and told me oliver you have to get yourself a good education because this isnt it for you so i had to start taking my music more seriously than i had before just to make a night as a yearold kid when oliver was a yearold high school student the famous count basie band came to town minus a sax player alto saxophonist ernie wilkins and trumpeter clark terry had hemd of young oliver and went to his parents home at two in tlie morning to offer him the job they were greeted by a rather stem mrs nelson unaccustomed to receiving visitors at such hours when they told her count basie might be interested in hiring oliver she wasted no time in telling them olivers going to finish school he cant go and left them standing on the porch the next day i hated my parents nelson recalls here my big chance had come and my mother had turned them away when they came for me but it didnt take me long to realize she had done the right thing if i had gone out then i dont know where id be now maybe junkin somewhere or i dont know what itis parents had made it clear to him all along that he could play in bands only on weekends or during the summer with the stipulation that it depends on who it is and where it is and whether they come to get you and bring you back home he followed their orders working with the jeterpillars band and george hudsons orchestra both based in st louis and with tlie nat towles territory band booked out of omaha they played what he remembers as being dances for prominent white folks following graduation from high school oliver joined the newly organized band of alto saxophonist louis jordan it was then that he began writing arrangements putting each part down tediously at the piano only later learning tlie customary shortcuts by the time he was he was married though that marriage the first of three did not work out in he entered the marine corps playing woodwinds with the third marine division band in japan and korea while he was with that band in japan he experienced the second of two important musical awakenings the first had come at the age of when he had heard a lie concert by duke ellington and he remembers wtien i heard duke really heard music for the first time the second was when he attended a concert by the tokxo philharmonic lie recalls they played ravels mother goose suite and paul hindemiths symphony in e flat it was the first time i had really heard modern music for back in st louis i hadnt even known negroes were allowed to go to concerts i realized e erjthing didnt hae to sound like beethoven or brahms though they were unbelievable i lifted a book on hindemiths music from the library and played things from it on the piano it was the first time i had heard progressions like that it was then that i decided to become a composer back in the states oliver entered washington university as a student of composition to help pay for his schooling he worked as a conductornot of an orchestra but on a streetcar line there were a few times when he tried to run away from music by studying taxidermy and embalming during another marriage he turned away from his art completely becoming a seventh day adventist and making his living as a bus driver eventually it beciune apparent to him that life would be empt without the music ho loved so much however the formal study of it presented certain obstacles white academicians and even the black ones disdained the music called jazz which was so much a part of him in one music history class the professor claimed jazz erndd not be considered art because it was an improx ised music oliver pointed out that the music played by fourteenthcentury troubadours in europe had been improvised and unwritten until someone took the time to codify it yet this was the same music they were studying as irt evidently nelson toll the professor this music is considered art because it is european and was improxised whereas jazz is not considered art because it is european and was improvised whereas jazz is not considered art because it is not european and is improvised he didnt do so well in the course i got a b plus he recalls he was invited back to that same washington university in to conduct a seres of classes on music for the mass media covering the areas of composition arranging and playing in a big band confronted xvith students questions on how one really xxent about building jazz improvisations nelson realized that no good and compact book cxisted explaining this unique art he set about writing one showing through a series of musical examples how improvisations most commonly are based on certain note patterns this book patterns for saxophone and related woodwind instriiments has been hailed by musicians as a bridge between theory and application for most musicians nexv york alxvays has been the big testgetting in there and being ready when oliver nelson went to new york city in he was thoroughly ready immediately he found work with the erskin haxvkins comho featuring wild bill davis on organ it wasnt long before he moxed into the big bands drawing upon the full range of his arranging composing and performing talents he was soon in great demand and recording companies began seeking him out to write and conduct albums since that time he has done albums on labels with this sort of backjjjrouncl he was a natural for the held of nioie and television composing whichwith the ccption of calvin jacksonwas so lilywhite for so very long in their attempts to capture a more modern sound musical directors in these media have turned away somewhat from the stringy european style and the composers of that school who dominated the background music field for so many years rhythm is in with more than a touch of rock so black composers finally are getting a break in this prestigious and wellpaying field olixer serxed as arranger and conductor for the noxx defunct mr broadwaij before copping his oxxn composition gig with ironside and learning how to time cxervlhing to the second now that the door has opentd oliver finds himself faced with the grim prospect of sacrificing his art to his carefully cultix atcd success ilis greatest challenge came only tliis summer xvhen he had an opportunity to become a full partner in a milliondollar brother oxxucd tape duplicating company he xxas to bead its nexv record division investing his musical knoxvhoxv instead of cash lie had hoped such a record company might be uscd to exposc the talents of fine artists xvlio bad not enjoyed the benefits of commercial success when it xvas manifest that commercialism precedd aesthetic considerations he xvithdrexv from this project that might have made him a rich man instead he will donate his time to a neighborhood youth project conducted by harry grant a fonner musician xvbo hopes to inspire and instruct talented youngsters courses xvill be conducted on a weekly basis with merely a minimal charge to impress upon the students a respect for what theyre getting this xvill he primarily for black youngsters though xxe xxont turn a while kid away oliver explains the main objectix e will be to prepare black youngsters for the good jobs available in moxic and television studios the trouble xvith a gifted negro musician from the ghetto says oliver is that he might be able to get his hands on a single sax and to cook on it but if hes going to make it in a studio band xvhere hes going to earn maybe or more thousand dollars a year hell liax e to be able to play not only all the saxophones but akso clarinet c flute alto flute piccolo and bass clarinet plus sometimes oboe and english liorn a negro kid from the ghetto can hardly afford one of these instruments xvhich run from s to much less all of them yet he has to be good on all those horns just to get his foot in the door this sort of subtle discrimination is the xxay hollyvood has kept the negro doxvn he is conx inced that xxc are more qualified to train our oxvn people than anybody else and realizing that there is noxv a significant demand for a product from us he is intent upon helping others to prepare for their futiires whatexer they might be with the casual grace of one conditioned to success he leans back in his beautiful studio and muses here i am a composer and i should be worried about education but i think thats part of my responsibility too others helped ns and so xve should noxv be looking out for those xvbo xvill come along behind us and to prepare the way for tlicm m en like eugene tatum who saw the world turn upside down in the second of a land mine explosion face the future from the seat of a whtelchair in the oiinions of many they are cripples dependent on others for almost e erv need m not so protest the handicapped and this summer they aggressiely set out to proe it again at their th annual wheelchair games in new york says a smiling eugene tatum once a fivesport ictterman in high school since joined the wheelchair games i dont have time to sit down and mope anymore tatum from philadelphia was one of almost wheelchair athletes who met to test their skills the e cuts ranged from bowling to archery from weightlifting to table tennis and featured track meet races including a wheelchair slalom in the heat of competition during the threeday meet spectators began to realize that the contestants were indeed something special after world wir ii many disabled veterans laced long periods of recovery in yterans vdministration hospitals but it wasn t until that benjamin h lapton organized the first games in cooperation with the paralyzed xeterans assn of merica and new yorks adelphi gollege now adelphi university i played sports as a young man says lipton and this helped me to see the v alue of sports and recreation as a very important discipline for the rehabilitation of the disabled since that time lipton has seen the games spread to countries he estimates that more than wheelchair athletes hav e joined organized competition and approximately lokk disabled persons participate in sports

encourage more black wheelchair athletes if we could get more of the brothers to join he adds we could dominate wheelchair sports just the way wc do regular competitions t he teleision cameras are set for just the right exposure in the sheltered light of an old fishnet factory serving now as command headquarters of the th light infantry brigade in binh chanh south vietnam newsmen wait expectantly with their pencils and pads drawn up nearby are the brigades staff officers and battalion commanders including a sprinkling of negro majors and lieutenant colonels about offduty gis complete the cast of the drama about to unfold the center of all the excitement is a husky graving army colonel described as tough and up tight by his men while the colonel stands at attention gen creighton abrams the u s commander in vietnam pins a silver star on the formers shoulder and savs for all to hear in my judgment i know of no officer more deserving the short field ceremony turns frederic ellis davison into a brigadier general and makes him only the third negro in american military history to win a generals star and the first in a battle command quickly the brigade produces a decorated cake with davisons name and new rank on it a cook awkwardly cuts it with a maelute its handle wrapped in tinfoil to give it a festive look then after one glass of champagne and a few words with reporters the new general boards his helicopter to inspect each of his units and also visit with his wounded comrades in the hospitalsomething he does every sunday without fail it was years ago when gen davison then a captain led a segregated negro infantry company in italy during world war ii since that time the army has made what he calls nnbe lieyable progress in eliminating segregation last november he went to vietnam as deputy commander of the ith situated in the defense perimeter around saigon during the tet offensive of last february while the brigades commander was absent davison led the defense of the u s base at long binh in which americans died and some x attaekimr troops were killed it was the first time a negro had e er led an infantry brigade in combat from that time on troopers of the th called dav ison the old man even after their eommander brig gen franklin davis jr returned then in august when dav is was seriously wounded and evacuated to the u s davison again took over the brigade when it was announced a month earlier that davison vvonld be promoted to brigadier general gen abrams had planned to put him in a normal onestar slot as an assistant division commander but his record as deputy commander of the ith practically insured that he would get full command it is one of the choice independent commands in viet nam for a onestar general tliere only five such indeidendent brigades to come out here bei cause i felt i could make a contribution says gen davison of his vietnam tour of duty i want to make sure that my daughtersand i have four of themcan grow up in a free country i want them to know that their father has fought for it i envision one america an integrated america the general is disturbed by americas racial troubles and by the breakdown in communication between his generation and young people more specifically he has no sympathy with black_power advocates who preach militant separation in this brigade im not going to put up with black iowcr or white power or yellow power or red power he says to make sure he knows what is going on in the ranks he is in his helicopter daily talking to officers and troopers alike he wants his men to return home feeling they have done something and that black and white alike have been treated fairly by the army i think weve got a great country davison says with some passion i believe in it i believe in its future i dont think that america can afford segregation if were going to keep up in the international race as a great nation it requires tapping all the talent weve got while admitting that the army is not perfect davison insists i believe the opportunity is there it isnt equal yet but its equalizing the general speaks from the perspective of years of military service much of which was rigidly segregated black soldiers resented segregated units he recalls because wc didnt feel we were given the true opportunity to show our capabilities on the other hand we tried to prove that even under these handicaps the job could be done after world war ii davison who had been a reserve officer accepted a regular army commission i hoped i could get into an army medical training program and combine two careers he recalls but the dream stretching back in the late s when he was a howard university student majoring in zoology and chemistry never became a reality indeed he switched from these sciences in which howard had awarded him a masters degree in to international affairs in which he earned a masters degree from george washington university in a year earlier he was the first negro to enter the army war college an institution specifically designed to train senior army officers impressed with improvements for the negro soldier since the military was desegregated in davison points out all the records reflect that when you toss soldiers of all races into an outfit everybody performs up to the outfits standards as far as im concerned if a person is under my command or supervision he either performs or i take appropriate measuresno matter what his race is summing up his racial feelings he adds on the battlefields there is no black or white and everyones blood nins red when hes hit a day in the life of gen davison is likely to be unbelievably busy and full up in time for breakfast by seven he is airborne in his command helicopter by eightthirty and moving around the company positions out in the fields rice paddies and jungles around saigon he maintains constant radio contact with his command post with heavy artillery attached to his unit and with a number of forward positions strategically placed on the south and west approaches of saigonfavorite routes for viet cong assaults by noon he is back at his forward headquarters to compare notes with staff officers and then it s back out with the troops until about five his supper is followed by an evening briefing at seven and piles of paperwork the general gets to bed each night at or depending on how high the papers are piled he gets little time to relax with his photography and music hobbies but he claims the best relaxation is getting out and talking with the troops in the field davison highly regards eycballtocyeball contact with the men in his command he could rely on field reports from his field commanders but he says its in the field where you really learn whats going on reports filter up to you and of course they may or may not be messaged certainly they reflect much of the view of the commander unquestionably these reports are honest the commanders are certainly officers of integrity howe cr if you want to get to the grass roots and know exactly what the problems and the attitudes of the men are youve got to talk to them extremely fond of his troops davison says proudly i believe this is probably the finest brigade in the army certainly ive never worked with nor have i been assigned to a unit which has a greater spirit of camaraderie more of a cando attitude more of a will to help each other the general backs up these warm words with equally warm actions without fail sunday is his day to visit hospitalized troopers i visit the youngsters he says because they were carrying out orders i had given i think the least i can do is let them know i appreciate what theyve done that theyve not been forgotten and most important i try to find out what i can do to help them with the little problems the things that may seem inconsequential when you consider them in the overall concept of the problems we face here but which are large to the youngsters as individuals confident in the fighting ability of the th davison says the viet cong can still mount a large but not a successful attack i believe theyll have even more disastrous results than before b y any measure the career of lois jones pierrenotd has been a remarkable one recipient of prizes and awards elected fellow of londons royal society of arts she has devoted her life to a quiet explorationa quest for new meanings m color texture and design and as a professor at howard university as well as an artist she inspires many others to further their own search for selfexpression a surv ey of works by painter lois mailou jones mrs pierrenoers professional name underlines the diversity of her art there are the french impressionistic worksnostalgic silvery parisian street scenes and sunlit highkeyed landscapes from southern francepainted during the artists first visit to france in and during frequent trips ever since there are the haitian onesdecorative often cubist impressions of haitian life and scenery and somber mystic compositions filled with voodoo symbolsinspired by her contacts with that caribbean nation since her marriage years ago to haitian artist vergniaud pierrenoel but there are also american seascapes striking portraits african and afroamerican compositions and abstract designs yet her style unifies these differing themes a lois mailou jones is recognizable by its vivid color and its strength in structure and design critics have commented that hers is a happy art and she agrees even though i sometimes portray scenes of poor and struggling people she says it is a great joy to paint since her marriage mrs pierrenoers work has been strongly influenced by haitian culture in the haitian government invited her to do a series of paintings of the island its scenery its people more recently she spent six weeks there conducting a survey of contemporary haitian painters sculptors and ceramicists for howard university but she emphasizes her preoccupation with haiti is just one phase of her interest in black art next on her list is a study of afroamerican painters and a longawaited visit to africa t oday lois pienenoel is represented in sixteen permanent collections in the u s and abroad she has won numerous awards and was decorated by haitian president paul e magloire for achievement in rt she has had about onewoman shows and has been represented in over group exliibitions but it was tough many times she admits its only been in the last years that we negro artists have been able to get good galleries for our exhibits she says although her own paintings were accepted and acclaimed by the prestigious socicte des artistes fratiah in paris as early as it was not until that one of her canvases was hung in the corcoran galler of art in washington and then only after it had been entered by one of her white friends the corcoran had a rule that no negros work should be displayed on its walls the oil painting was awarded first prize in the annual exhibition but it was years before lois jones claimed her award it was because of such experiences that france came to mean so much to lois jones it gave me my first feeling of absolute freedom she explains i felt there was no barrier no shackles when i arrived in paris in i could live in any place i could afford study with the best professors and exhibit in some of the best galleries france remained her spiritual homeland until she married vergniaud pierrenoel the couple first met in when they were both taking courses at columbia university in new york their careers separated them but in their paths crossed again and they decided on marriage mr pierrenoel now an american citizen comes from a prominent haitian family and is a renowned artist in his own right marriage to pierrenoel brought personal happiness to lois jonesshe discovered that a career isnt everything for a woman she saysand it also gave new direction and insiiration to her art with his encouragement she hopes to continueand bring new interpretations of haitian and afro themes to her canvases l ois jones picrrenoel a petite impulsive woman with laughing eyes and expressive gestures wanted to be an artist from the day she got her first set of watercolor paints at the age of seven bom in boston she escaped much of the prejudice experienced by black children in other parts of the country but it was not long before she discovered that there was a color problem in art in when she was about to graduate from the museum of fine arts school in boston she decided to apply for an assistantship at the school she had been an outstanding scholarship student throughout her four years there we have no need for anyone here was the harsh answer why dont you go south to help your people shocked and disappointed lois jones first considered a career as a textile designer in new york since she had done freelance work in that field but then decided that maybe she was needed in the south after all she accepted a position as head of the art department at palmer memorial institute in north carolina after two years during which she experienced firsthand the humiliation and frustration of southern segregation she was recmited to the fine arts department at howard university in washington where she has remained ever since she is now professor of design and watercolor painting at howard but her teaching has not been confined to the classroom for years her home has served as an inspiration center for black artists t he hall of man in africa which opened in june at new yorks american museum of natural history is fast hecoming a major tourist attraetion featuring some x exhibits and thousands of artifactsmost of which hae never before been displayedreflecting traditional social organization on the african continent the hall is the product of seven years preparation under the supervision of africa scholar dr colin m turnbull associate curator of african ethnology at the museum the hall suggests an african village and includes three lifelike dioramas and despite some criticism of its emphasis on small tribal life at the expense of aneient african empires and presentday nationstates it is considered a significant contribution to the afroamericans quest for identity and of educational value to the nation as a whole n the summer of organized baseball in america was a white mans game his private club a closed corporation it was in fact as lilywhite as the ku klux klan and in a sense its operators were more bold in their practice of bigotry than the most notorious of kleagles organized baseball scorning the hooded uniform was unafraid of daylight and practiced its bigotry in full view of millions of fans the nation over boasting all the while that it was the national pastime and a grand old game describing the unwritten law which barred american negroes from its hallowed diamonds as a gentlemens agreement no known american negro had played this grand old gameorganised baseball meaning white mans baseballduring the th century a lightskinned negro catcher passing for white had played several years prior to in the pacific coast league someone was later to say but as late as this man whoever he was apparently was reluctant to step out of anonymity and chortle over the trick he had played on the bigots years ago certain baltimore negroes repeatedly insisted that babe ruth baseballs greatest major league slugger was indeed a negro just look at that nose they said but outside of the negro press nobody paid any attention to these peopleand what difference did it make anyway babe ruth believed himself to be caucasian there was a storv in boston about a cuban negro named ramon herrera who allegedly had played with the red sox in the middle s and someone said ihe great new york giants manager john muggsy mcgraw had smuggled a negro into organized baseball as an indian and that he had actually played a few games but if herrera made history his book was burned and mcgraws widow told the author she had never heard the story about the negro indian no organized baseball was comfortably smugly happily lilywhite and for the most part the people who operated the sport intended to keep it that way for the rest of time the status fuo was plenty good enough for them not even the most assiduous investigator private or public eye could hae detected any tangible evidence suggesting that a negro player would come along to freckle lilywhite organized baseball any time soon the vast majority of executives in organized baseball was satisfied with the games racial tradition few of them possesscd the courage athletic translation guts to integrate one man who surely had all the guts in the world who the hell would stop me if i wanted to sign a negio player just wasnt interested in a twist of thought which sounded utterly ridiculous to people unfamiliar with the bigots twisted mind this man ecpiated baseball with interracial romance you know hows fan idolize ball players this man told a negro who had asked him about the possibility of integration many of our fans are white womtmi it might cause unpleasantmss if these women became attached to a negro home run hitter and so in the summer of organized baseball went on about its bigoted business and the negro player was restricted to his own looselyknit leagues in what bunny downs busdriver for the negro cincinnati clowns called tourist baseball what bunnv dowms said was shuckin corn hoein taters pickin ing on doors about the time the players fell asleep they slept in fleabag hotels that is when they werent tr ing to sleep on their buses en route from town to town not infrequently being forced to purchase food in places w here they couldnt sit dow nand they had better not get injured most w hite people who gave any thought to negro laseball required fewer words than bunny downs to describe it they recuired fact is only one word to describe negro baseballbush they said it so convincingly that one noted negro sportswtiter took the whitewashing of his mind w ith far less pain than he had taken accination of his arm when he was a kid when someone spoke to him about the possibility of integration of organized baseball this negro sports writer said negro players werent qualified oscar charleston josh gibson satchel paige smokey joe williams john ileniy lloyd bullet joe rogan were then either playing or had played baseball as wcw as anybody who had ever played itas well as ty cobb babe ruth and walter johnson had ever played itbut tlie white mans verdict part of the attempt to justify his bigotry was that negro players wcrent jualified to play organized ball and the uncle tom echoed the white mans sentiments and that put the lid on or so it seemed but while the detroit tigers and chicago cubs wcre slugging their way toward major league pennants in the summer of one white executie ciuietly secretly plotted an assault on baseballs systematic practice of racial discrimination this executie had a lie knew that it was wrong to bar a man from organized baseball simply because of his race or color he was courageous if courage and guts were synonymous then his intestines were a thousand miles long he wasnt afraid to buck the establishment he did not equate baseball w ith romance he was a great judge of talent he knew that baseball was robbing itself of a gold mine of talent when it indulged itself in the evil luxury of racial prejudice and being the games reigning genius he knew how to right the wtong he knew what steps to take and he knew how to dodge the lethal slugs this mans name was branch rickev he was president and general manager of the brooklyn dodgers a storied old national league ball club io best understand branch rickev and the whys and hows of his thensecret plan to break the unwritten law one must know something about his background his life his experiences his mind for there one finds the key to what was for some time in the future a riddle that puzzled lesser minds men and moguls weslev branch rickev w as born into the de voutly religious southern ohio farm family of jacob and emily rickey on december sl he began to learn about the bible from his mother before he could spiak the words her religious teachings inhuenced his entire life in respect for her love ol the sabbath day rickey abstained from sunday baseball he did in fact insist on having it specifically noted in his professional baseball contracts that he w ould not be required to play baselall on sundays and it was a hassu w ith the team manager over this contractual irovision which cost him an opportunih to play major league baseball with the cincinnati reds in simply becaiise rickey refused to play basball on sunday the reds manager quit speaking to him and the older playirs ostracized him tluy wouldnt even permit him to take batting practice with them he was released to the dallas minor league team from which he had come when rickey was months old his familv moved across the scioto river from madison tow nship where he was born to rush towiiship he first attended school in rush town cotton aint no tougher than this business no sir for a real hardworking business day in and day out you gotta take this here whatchacallit tourist baseball white major league stars played according to fixed schedules traveled from city to city in pullman cars slept each night in comfortable hoteks ate in fine resturants and were idolized nationally as some kind of gods but the best of the negro players wcre subjected to the tedious rigors of schedules which differed little from those of blues bands working onenight stands they sometimes played two games in a day in two different cities as many as three in three low pay which without any forewarning could also become slow or no pay fleabag hotels whcre prostitutes came kiiock ship and next in nearby lucasville as a youth he was sensitive about a stutter in his speech and his hayseedishness but he conquered the speech defect and as he got around he combed the hayseed out of his hair following graduation from high school in lucasv ille he passed the scioto county board examinations and was certified to teach for two years he taught at the friendship school in the turkey creek section of scioto county top salary a month he quit his fledgling career as a school teacher to resume his own education at ohio wesleyan where incidentally his girlfriend from lucasville jane moulton was also a student their romance flourished over the years and on june branch rickey married jane moulton in her lucasville home one summer during his student years rickey accepted a week from a pickup team called the portsmouth ohio navies the following fall when rickey went out for football at ohio wesleyan university he was asked to sign an application form pursuant to the articles of agreement of the newlyfounded ohio college conference one question had to do with professionalism ie participating in sports for money rickey could easily have lied and signed the application claiming that he had never played for pay what he had done was not morally wrong and the lie was not unknown in college sports circles not even then but this he steadfastly refused to do he thereby declared himself ineligible for participation in ohio wesleyan sports even after the portsmouth manager himself lied saying i never paid the boy a damned cent rickey refused to sign the application ohio wesleyan authorities were disappointed rickey was a good athlete and shocked more than somewhat but the next spring they rewarded his honesty by appointing him to the dual positions of baseball coach and director of athletics salary for the spring although rickey was still a student and only years of age one of rickeys ohio wesleyan players was a negro named charlie thomas a fine fielder hard hitter and strong thrower from charlie thomas the negro outfielder whom he converted to catcher for the purpose of taking better advantage of his throwing arm rickey learned about the terrible degradation of racial prejudice and that ones race or color of skin had nothing whatsoever to do with ones ability while he was a youngster branch rickey learned about baseball from an older brother orla he took quickly to the game sharpening his interest and knowledge by reading baseball stories in the cincinnati enquirer newspaper and scanning advertisements in spaldings guide a trade publication baseball became and remained his no sport a catcher he had good speed threw well was a fair hitter and an inspirational leader prior to dallas he played minor league ball in such towns as terre haute ind and lcmars la for a month following graduation from ohio wesleyan university in he had coached a fine fast team that springbranch rickey went to dallas where in games he batted scored runs stole bases amassed assists and impressed his auditors as a brilliantminded takecharge player on the strength of that the cincinnati reds acciuired his contract but following the hassle over sunday ball the contract rev erted to dallas which sold it next to the chicago white sox who sold it to the st louis brovvms branch rickey reported to the st louis browns in the spring of having meanwhile completed one of two years of teaching english history and shakespeare at allegheny college in pennsylvania on june rickey caught his first major league baseball game but that night brother orla called to say that their mother was seriously ill rickey went home and several weeks passed btforc his mothers crisis was over when he called the manager of the st louis browns the manager said the browns werent going any place in the pennant race they didnt need him and he was free to return to dallas he went back to dallas and led a poor team through five exciting weeks of winning baseball after the season he returned to allegheny college learning subsequently that the st louis browns wanted him to rejoin them in spring training he rejoined the browns in and although a thumb injury on september ended the season for him was a good year for one thing as previously mentioned he had married jane moulton on june during the following winter the st louis browns sold rickeys contract to the new york highlanders who permitted him to skip spring training so that he could discharge his obligations as baseball coach at ohio wesleyan to which he had returned during workouts there he developed soreness in his throwing arm and shoulder he hastened his departure from ohio wesleyan leavmg his team in tlie hands of an assistant and joined the highlanders but he couldnt throw he never threw well again he caught his last major league game on september he then plunged into the heavy schedule of coaching owu studying and political campaigning for prohibition which wore him out he contracted tuberculosis and entered a sanitarimn following his release from the sanitarium he enrolled in the university of michigan he was graduated from the university of michigan law school on june passed the bar in idaho on the following september and became an active partner in the firm of rickey crow and ebbert in a amonth office in boise shortly after the first of the year the call of baseball got to him and he sent a slightlyexaggerated telegram to the university of michigan am starving will be back without delay he promised his law partners that he would retuni to the firm in june for all practical purposes though branch rickeys days as an idaho lawyer were over after coaching the michigan team that year he scouted players as far west as the pacific coast campaigned for the presidential election of theodore rooseclt and accepted a multifaceted positionpresidential assistant scout etcwith the st louis browns salary annually from the brovvms with pennission to coach one more season at michigan total income for the year shortly after he reported to the browns office in january of he was named vicepresident and secretary of the team in september he also assumed the post of field manager for seeral years both with the browns and the st louis cardinals he was literallv to work all over the executive landscape in major league baseball but he finally settled down into frontoffice executive management and it was there that he made an indelible mark on the game perhaps no man was ever a better judge of baseball talent than branch rickey as a baseball executive he was creative innovative progressive his perfection of the farm system enabled clubs not overly rich in money to compete with and beat wealthier clubs he organized baseballs first allpurpose training camp for the browns at st petersburg fla in february he was among the first if not the first to organize knothole gangs for kid fans he refined scouting until it was an art after he moved from his executive post with the browns over to the cardinals and built winning teams it was said that he changed penury to pennants the cardinals won their first national league pennant in they also won pennants in andalthough branch rickey had now gone to brooklyn and during all this time of course organized baseball was lilywhite the lilywhiteness of baseball extended from the executive frontoffice to the playing field and in numerous parks into the stands when charlie thomas by then a successful new mexico dentist came to visit branch rickey in his st louis cardinals office years after leaving ohio wesleyan negroes were permitted only to occupy segregated seats at the park samuel breadon then president of the cardinals reportedly held the opinion that a substantial number of white fans would refuse to attend cardinal games if the stands were integrated st louis was itself a bastion of racial prejudice and segregation to save thomas from embarrassment on the day of thomas visit branch rickey sat in his office with him throughout the game but rickey promised thomas that some day racial conditions would be different and organized baseball would be integrated rickey had first made that vow to thomas when they were both at ohio wesleyan university from the very first day i entered ohio wesleyan dr charlie thomas said once branch rickey took special interest in my welfare as the first negro player on any of its teams some of the fellows didnt welcome me too kindly though there was no open opposition but i always felt that branch set them straight during the three years that i was at ohio wesleyan no man could have been treated better when we went on our trips rickey was the first one to see if i was welcome to the hotel where we were to stop on several occasions he talked tlie management into allowing me to occupy a double room with him and his roommate barney russell one racial incident occurred in the spring of when rickey took the ohio wesleyan baseball team to south bend ind reservations for the teamincluding its negro member charlie thomashad been made at the oliver hotel but as soon as the team entered the hotel and the hotel manager saw thomas jim crow jumped up curtly the manager stopped the team and declared that the negro could not go upstairs to a room rickey quickly dispatched his student manager to a local ymca in search of a room for thomas thomas told rickey that perhajs it would be better if he returned to ohio wesleyan university no no branch rickey said well be all right subsequently rickey persuaded the hotel supervisor to let thomas wait upstairs in rickeys room that accomplished rickey had a cot moved into his room for charlie thomas up in rickeys room thomasa strong pound athletebroke down crushed by this bout with jim crow he sat on the cot his huge body hunched forward and stared despairingly at his hands its these he said repeatedly theyre black if it werent for my skin i wouldnt be any different from anybody if only my hands were white charlie thomas pulled violently at first one hand and then the other trying it seemed to tear the black skin from himself rickey watching attempted to ease thomas mental burden tommy rickey said the day will come when they wont have to be white branch rickey resolved then if ever an opportunity was presented to him he would demolish the racial barriers against negro athletes he repeated the vow as said in his st louis cardinal office years later up to that time he had not gained enough power to change baseballs complexion at that time he worked for a man sam breadon who was in no way inclined to integrate the game nearly years passed between the time of the oliver hotel incident and the day branch rickey found a way to keep his vow to charlie thomas shortly after the st louis cardinals defeated the new york yankees in the world series of rickey left st louis to accept a position as president and general manager of the brooklyn dodgers who had won only a single national league pennant in years accepting the position rickey signed a fiveyear contract which guar anteed him a xx annual salary plus a liberal expense account and an attendance bonus based on increases over fans he was then going on years old but his biographer tlic late arthur mann said his energy and outlook belied his age he was active virile quick of step and idealistic his new position in brooklyn and world war ii combined to create the opportunity for him to keep the vow he had first made to charlie thomas in south bend years earlier during the war the u s armed forces decimated the ranks of organized baseballs young players replacing their bats and balls with rifles and grenades rickey determined to compensate for war losses and to build for the future began now to give serious thought to the possibility of hiring negro athletes the time was ripe world war ii had given american negroes a more substantial share of fair employment than any previous era in american history tlie practice of fighting wars for freedom with segregated military units was dying and large numbers of american negroes found employment in war plants when rickey assumed his executive post in brooklm george c mclaughlin was president of the brooklyn trust company which controlled dodger policy by right of trusteeship of per cent of the teams stock owned by the heirs of charles ebbets club president in earlier dodger history and the man for whom ebbets field was named rickey told george mclaughlin who was also a ranking new york political figure that he wanted to meet with the teams board of directors for the purpose of discussing the massscouting of players and that rickey added miht include a negro player or two i dont see why not mclaughlin said you might come up with something if you find the man who is better tlian tlie otliers youu beat it if you dont youre sunkfollowing lengthy discussions the board of directors approncd rickeys ideas and plans including the scouting of negro players among those affirming these plans and ideas was walter omalley who was later to become president and principal owner of the team and the man most responsible for major leagues invasion of the west coast all members of the board pledged themselves to secrecy about the negro facet of the new dodger programwhich in the opinion of rickey would enable him to build a dynasty in brooklyn as well as soke a racial problem in his meticulouslydetailed outline for the introduction of american negroes to organized baseball rickey covered every imaginable angle he had secured the approval of the brooklyn dodgers board of directors mong other important items selection of a negro player who would be the right man on and off the field winning a favorable reaction from the communication media and the public securing the supiort and understanding of american negroes securing acceptance of the negro ilayer by his white teammates many of wliom would be southerners who had harbored racial prejudices since childhood in deference to baseballs racial prejudices rickey invented a gimmick which enabled him to begin scouting negro irospects in secrecy with the assistance of gus greenlee a negro businessman who owned the pittsburgh crawfords a negro league team rickey organized the united states league this league was for all intents and purposes another negro league which would compete with the existing negro american and national leagues rickey was to sponsor a team the brown dodgers which was to play in ebbets field when the brooklyn dodgers were on the road fortified with his gimmick rickey was at last free to send his scouts in search of negro players the scouts were instructed to appraise negro players in the united states and latin america where many of them played winter baseball among the scouts were wid matthews george sisler best known as an alltimegreat major league first baseman clyde sukeforth and tom greenwade all of them possibly excepting greenwade thought they were searching for brown dodgers greenwade was to say that he knew all along that rickcy planned to sign ntgro players for the brooklyn dodgers among the negro players rickeys scouts appraised were buck leonard hardhitting fancyfielding first baseman of the homestead grays james cool papa bell the grays fleetfooted slashhitting outfielder marvin williams the philadelphia stars second baseman sam jetliroe the cleveland buckeyes swift switchhitting center fielder lorenzo piper davis the birmingham black barons dependable infielder roy campanella the baltimore elite giants young catcher and jackie robinson the kansas city monarchs shortstop in the opinion of many negro fans all of these players and others as well were more than capable of playing major league baseball but rickey was looking for something more than a talented ierformer he was looking for a mon i had to get a man he was to explain who would carry the burden on the field i needed a man to carrv the badge of martvrdom the press had to accept him he had to stimulate a good reaction of the negro race itself for an unfortunate one might have solidified antagonism of people of other colors and had to consider the attitude of the mans teammates coincidental with rickeys negro scouting program but know ing nothing of it piessure groups were forming fast to force racial issues from all avenues rickey deplored the thought of force as a factor in his objective arthur mann said in his book branch rickey american in action without a hint of his plan rickey discussed the negros right to play organized baseball and openly espoused it while speaking before the brooklyn rotary club in he said the cause of prohibition a most worthy one was thrown back a hundred years by the wlstead act very possibly the introduction of a negro in baseball even without force might similarly throw back their cause of racial ecpiality a quartercentury or more two of his rickeys family who knew of his plan were unable to encourage him in understandable fear of inevitable controversy jane rickey pleaded why should you be the one to do it havent you done enough for baseball cant someone else do something for a change it means we ll be cut out of scouting in the south branch rickey jr said with a sigh for a while yes the father replied not forever alexander pople covers it mighty well in his essay on man they dont want negroes in baseball but when it happens we first endure then pity then embrace as scouting reports were checked one name was mentioned more frequently than any otherjackie robinson by coincidence the same name had been mentioned to rickey after he held a press conference in the spring of to announce formation of the united states league one of the writers present was wendell smith a sportswriter for the pittsburgh courier then americas largest negro newspaper smith was not overlv enthusiastic about rickevs announcement first because he represented a publication which had criticized baseball for years for its jim crow tradition second because he had just returned from an illfated trip to boston where the red sox had gone through the motions of trying out three negro players one of them jackie robinson the tryout had been arranged by isadore muehnick a boston city councilman who had threatened to revoke the red soxs sunday base ball permit unless the team gave negro players a chance as smith recalls the club in boston agreed to look over the three negro playersrobinson jethroe and williams while these players traveled from new york to boston according to smith they wondered to themselves if they actually had any chance of playing major league baseball or if this was just another farce this may be a shot in the dark robinson said but it could mean something for the future if they dont select us they may at least realize that there are negro players around the country worthy of consideration upon our arrival in boston smith said the first thing we did was contact councilman muchnick who in turn notified the red sox that the three negro players had arrived in town ready for a tryout the representative of the red sox promised muchnick he would set a time for the tiywit after discussing the situation with joe cronin manager of the red sox the discussion with cronin must hae been long and tedious because nothing happened for two days finally muchnick put some extra pressure on the management of the club and it was decided that the three players would be given a tryout at noon on april robinson williams and jethroe reported at fenway park at the specified time got their uniforms and went out into the field approximately white hopefuls were already working out they were high school prospects and being tutored by two red sox instructors hugh duffy an old coach was in charge of the workout after robinson jethroe and williams had fielded a few balls hit by the high school prospects duffy called them to hit williams was the first to step into the batters box then robinson stepped into the batters box he walloped the first pitch against the big sign on the fence it was a line drive that whistled as it soared through the infield and continued to gain height robinson clouted a few more drives equally well and then stepped aside for jethroe the workout lasted about minutes when it was all over duffy called the three recruits aside and shook hands with them you boys look like dretty good ball players he said i hope you enjoyed the workout that was all nothing more was eer heard from the red sox when wendell smith heard rickey talk about formation of the new united states league he could not work up any enthusiasm for the plan rickey called smith aside however told him he had heard about the boston trip and asked if there were any negro players good enough to make the major leagues if you arent serious about this mr rickey smith said id rather not waste our time discussing it but if you are serious i do know of a player who could make it his name is jackie robinson it seems to me rickey said thoughtfully ive heard of that fellow somewhere well jackie robinson was a famous name it was the name of possibly the finest allaround athlete ever produced in america if jackie robinson wasnt greater than jim tliorpe then as now widely regarded as the finest of allaround athletes robinson could be ranked no more than a shade behind him robinson could hit a curve ball for one thing thorje never mastered the art jackie robinson was bom in cairo georgia on january he was reared from an early age in pasadena california his mother minus the support of a dutiful husband reared six children in a religious environment giving them the best home and education her meager resources permitted she was a domestic who worked long hard hours in order to provide for her children a better opportunity in life than was open to them in jim crow georgia like the other robinson children jackie chipped in to help himself and the family as soon as he was old and strong enough selling newspapers running errands performing any honest job that paid a few dollars he grew strong healthy clean in personal habits intelligent and godgifted in all the sports that claimed his interest and effort following graduation from muir technical high school in pasadena jackie entered pasadena junior college where he first came to national prominence by broadjumping feet inches he gained fame on the west coast meanwhile for his achievements in basketball football and baseball his achievements in trackandfield reminded many sports obser ers of his idol and older brother matthew mack robinson a member of americas olympic team in the fall of jackie entered the university of california at los ngeles ucla where he enlarged his fame oddly however he did not stand out as a hitting star in baseball his records in football and basketball were on the other hand superlative he was better than good in five sports and harley tinkham while writing for the nowdefunct los angeles mirror ranked him ahead of jim thorpe as an allaround athlete wilbur johns uclas basketball coach during robinsons student days later athletic director of the school attributed robinsons athletic prowess to beautiful timing and rhythm and the ability to relax completely whenever he wished robinson maintained perfect physical condition and he neither drank nor smoked sports and parttime work left robinson little time for romance and although he possessed a fine quicktrigger mind cut into the elegance of his grades this fact disturbed his mother she wanted him to become a professional man a doctor lawyer or coach jackie liked the last profession and as a youngster used it as an excuse to go out and play if i am going to be a ctach he would say to his mother ill have to keep playing you cant teach a game if you dont know it jackie robinson left ucla without graduating went to work and also played west coast professional football in he joined the u s cavalry and was sent to fort riley kansas in april he was transferred to camp hood texas where his outfit was motorized and alerted for overseas duty because of bad ankles however he was prevented from going overseas he w as plactd instead in limited service in december he was discharged from military service with the rank of lieutenant the next month he accepted a basketball coaching job at sam houston college in austin texas five months laterin the spring of he joined the kansas city monarchs traditionally one of the best teams in negro baseball for bis first and only negro league season he hit in negro american league ball meanwhile like legions of other young american negroes jackie had had his bouts w ith jim crow during the time jackie was growing up pasadena was anything but an open city a suburb of los angelivs the city was rancid with racial prejudicein housing in employment in recreational areas hobinson who was never afraid of white people in fact as a college star he drew the wrath of certain white sports writers for talking back to white people was mentally brutalized by police he was arrested once when he was doing nothing more than standing on a street cornerhe didnt move on fast enough when the family moved into a home on predominantly white pepper street certain white neighbors showed their resentment although mrs mallie bobinson had literallv worked like a slave to earn the monev to biiv the home in a most ridiculous scene one white adult engaged in a rockthrowing contest with young jackie until his wife called lum into their home with a remark about how sillv it was for him to fight w ith a little boy because he was aggressive unafraid and talked back to white people robiiisoii suffered in public comparisons vvitli kenny washington another great ucla athlete jackie developed a haired for southern california vvhieh endures perhaps to this day he has never made his home in the west since he achieved stardom in major league baseball he also experienced jim crow in the military serv ice at camp hood texas being called up for court martial after he refused to move back in a bus on orders from a white bigot the charges were dropped but not before jackie had learned more than uough about racial prejudice to prepare for his ordeal in organized baseball after appraising robinson several times one of rickeys scouts reported that robinsons arm was too weak for shortstop greenvvade was assigned to follow the monarchs and concentrate on robinson greenvvade subsequently offered the opinion that robinson was an excellent hunter and base runner but that he does not have a real good arm it is good enough for second basebut not for shortstop rranch rickey concluded from this infonnation that shortstop was not robinsons position what about second base george sisler was sent to scout robinsons potential as a second baseman a conservative appraiser of baseball talent sisler reported that jackie could play second base rickey meanwhile hav ing amassed a great deal of infonnation on jackie robinson as a person decided that he was his man now it was time to find jackie and bring him into brooklv n for a conference with rickey the monarchs were scheduled to play the ghicago american giants in chicago rickey sent siiktforth to chicago to get robinson he stressed to snkeforth that siikelorth must act in the strictest of secrecy snkeforth went to diicago discovered that robinson was slightly injured and out of the monarch liiuup and talked the skeptical athlete into making an awol trip to brooklyn on the bright tuesday morning of august snkeforth brought jackie to the door of rickeys office at montague street when he saw robinson rickey said hospitably come in come in hes the brooklyn type of player sukefortb said tlic boy can run like blazes and looks like he might be a pretty fair country hitter rickey years old bushbrovved bespectacled possessor of a cluirchillian mien nodded approvingly lifted the stub of a cigar from an ashtray on his massive walnut desk and appraised robinson with piercing eyes much like a pawnbroker examining a trinket brought in by an unfamiliar customer jackie robinsonhair neatly cropped his dark ruggedly handsome face lean his jaw strong liis shoulders broad shifted uneasily and having nothing better to do jammed a hand down into his coat pocket do you drink rickey asked suddenly no sir jackie replied thats fine rickey said relaxing now in liis svi el chair sit dow n sit down we have a lot to talk about robinson and snkeforth sat quickly do you know why you are here jackie rickey asked jackie said all he knew was that sukeforth had told him he had instriictions to bring him to brooklyn well hickey said slowly carefully i am interested in bringing you into the brooklyn organization i have never seen you play but my scouts have if sukeforth says youre a good ballplayer ill take his word for it hes been around and knows a prospect when he sees one he thinks as do some of my other men you could make good on one of our top farm clubs hickey mentioned some of the problems jackie robinson negro would face as he entered organized baseball rickey told robinson that he would have to stand a lot of gaff without losing his temper robinson by nature an intense competitive individual wasnt too happy over the prospects rickey foresaw but robinson was also extremely intelligent he knew as he said later that he was pretty sure to run into some namecalling some insults and some jim crow robinson told rickey he felt he could stay out of rhubarbs on the field and trouble of any kind off the field but he explained that he couldnt become an obsequious cringing fellow he said he couldnt play hard aggressive ball if he were that sort of man rickey apparently satisfied on that point changed the subject i havent made up my mind which farm club well put you on rickey said but wherever it is i want you to understand one thing there will be no limitations as to how far you can go we will not consider you in any ways different from the rest of the players we have in this organization you are simply another ballplayer trying to make the grade if you are good enough youll wind up on lop if you arent youll be sent down to another league or released outright rickey explained to jackie that he wanted to win pennants in brooklyn and that to do so he needed ballplayers he explained that the war had ravished the dodgers of playing talent and asked robinson if he was under contract to the kansas city monarchs no sir jackie said we dont have contracts do you ha e any agreementswritten or oralabout how long you will play for them no sir none at all i just work from pay day to pay day rickey continued to test and probe with numerous questions he reached into the top drawer of his desk and produced a book the life of christ by an italian priest giovanni papini the book had been published in rickey spent several minutes reading a chapter on nonresistance ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also for an infinite number of believers this principle of not resisting evil has been the unendurable and inacceptable scandal of christianity there are three answers which men can make to violence revenge flight turning the other cheek the first is the barbarous principle of retaliation flight is no better than retaliation the man who takes flight invites pursuit his weakness becomes the accomplice of the ferocity of others turning the other check means not receiving the second blow it means cutting the chain of the inevitable wrongs at the first link your adversary is ready for anything but tliis rickey was to explain that this was by far the most important point in the hiring of a negro by a major league club jackie robinson is a christian by inheritance and practice well before the interv iew ended he was fully convinced that the papini doctrine was necessary and acceptable he understood that the success of negro employment in baseball depended veiy largely on himself this shocking move required of course some booker t washington compromises with surface inequality for the sake of expediency it would require constant and silent reaction to abuseoral and physical there could be but one direction of dedicationthe doctrine of turning the other cheek there came in the greatness of jackie robinson punch for punch was by inheritance by experience and by desire jackies quick and natural reaction to insult or attack to selfimpose control of every decent reflex was almost too much to ask for from any man and particularly from jackie he was anything but ideal for this experiment it took an intelligent man to understand the challengeit took a man of great moral courage to accept it and see it through he was both the interview continued cfn you do itf rickey demanded of robinson can you do if rickey talked about arms legs swing guts do you have the guts to play the game no matter what happens rickey talked about the enormous responsibility involved he talked about basenmners sliding toward jackie spikes first of pitchers tlirowing at his head mr rickey robinson said theyve been throwing at my head for a long time branch rickey impersonated bigoted white players suppose i collide with you at second base when you get up i yell you dirty black son of a bitch what do you do mr rickey do you want a ballplayer who is afraid to fight back i want a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back rickey explained youve got to do this job with base hits and stolen bases and fielding ground balls jackie nothing else rickey impersonated a bigoted white southern hotel clerk who refused jackie a room and cursed him he impersonated bigoted white sports writers he impersonated bigoted white restaurant managers all the while he demanded to know of jackie robinson wm would you do the dramatic effort brought perspiration to rickeys brow robinson trembling with the rising tension clenched his fists rickey swung his own big fist at jackie robinsons head barely missing what do you do mr rickey robmson whispered ce got two cheeks is tliat it yes that was it the foundation of jackie robinsons career in organized baseball was laid then and there in the ecclesiastical dictum of model behavior you cant fight hack branch rickey and jackie robinson agreed that robinson would not fight back for three years the monetary considerations were bonus plus amonth salary until further notice rickey told robinson all details of their meeting and future plans were secret were tackling something big here jackie rickey explained if we fail no one will try it again for years were dealing with the right for any american to play baseballthe american game w e would address you by name but at this writing we do not know who you will be you might be president humphrey you might be president nixon you might god forbid even be president wallaw this nation is in such turmoil in these last few days before the election that almost anything is possible except of course that you could be president gregory it should seem strange that in a nation in which the election of an extremist george wallace is possible the election of a liberal dick gregory is impossible but it doesnt seem strange at all everyone knos deep in his heart that racism in the united stales is still so great that if oorge washington were to return to this nation as a black man ho would not stand the ghost of a chance of regaining his seat as president even a white jesus christ preaching love of ones fellowman as a way of life would be castigated by manv as a hippie and perhaps clubbed by police if he showed up at a national political convention the die is cast b ut enough of that the die is cast and you are now the presidentelect it is only a matter of a few weeks until you will be moving into the white ilotisc as the chief executive of the richest strongest nation in the world wc dont envy you no matter who v ou are by seeking the position you told the whole world that you helieed you were the most qualified person out of more than million to direct the fortunes of this nation now the whole w orld is waiting for you to put your money where your moutli is and its not going to be easy not since n ot since franklin delano roosevelt took over the reins of a depressionridden nation in has a president faced problems of the magnitude which w ill face you and in many ways the problems of today will be even more difficult to solve than those which faced mr roosevelt the depression hit everybodyrich and poor alike millionaires w ere reduced to paupers blue collar workers lost their jobs because factories closed as companies w ent into bankruptcy bosses and wliite collar workers joined laborers on the relief rolls longpoor blacks stood in breadlines with nevvlypoor whites and federal aid to the pkr was not opposed by biased politicians like those of today who describe welfare programs as discriminator aid to shiftless negroes president roosevelt headed an entire nation in economic crises and he could and did take drastic measures the wpa ccc bank holidavs nya social security unemployment compensation etc to put the nation back on the track but you are in a more complicated situation you will head a nation at the highest peak in its economic history for the majority of the more than iiiillion citizens in the u s prosperity isnt just around the corner its here but in the midst of this plenty some million people nearly ter cent of the total popidation arc liv ing in poert iu families wdiose gross annual income is about and you will hav e to face the fact that despite the constant harping in the press about the povert of negroes some million whites a number larger than the total negro population in the u s are desperately poor president lyndon b johnson tried to solve the problem of the poor with a poverty program reminiscent of that of president rooseveltand johnsons program failed a daring program of the twolane highway days is an insipid stop gap in the space age your problems with the poor among the million negroes in this country wth roughly one third of them living at or below the poverty level will be even more serious than that of the poor whites poor blacks see little chance of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps for they are still discriminated against by both wealthy and poor whites because of their color and in their despair can be led to senseless riot and revolt the problems arising from poverty in the midst of plenty will soon be in your hands and you had better with jet speed prepare a space age solution the war in vietnam s ince your election mr presidentelect we are sure that there has been little change in the war in vietnam there will probably he little change between now and your inauguration but watch out then before the election what was happening in vietnam was not your responsibility you could privately or publicly second guess vietnam polic you could talk about what you would do if elected now ou will have to bear the brunt of the attack from the antiwar groups you will be the target of the peacelov ing hippies and v ippies you will have to answer to the blacks who ask w hy should we furnish a proportionately higher number of the fighting men and the battle casualties you will have to face the fact that many black youths enlist in the services because life in a nondemocratic army is more rewarding financially than in the worlds largest democracy and even greater than all of this you are going to have to make the decisions which could hasten or forestall a nuclear war that could wipe out all mankind the youth explosion s ome of your biggest problems mr presidentelect are going to come from an area which politicians hav e seemingly ignored the population of this nation is grow ing younger each year half of the total population today is under years of age and among negroes half of the population is years of age or younger youth is impatient reckless and perhaps sometimes irresponsible black ghetto children will loot during riots teenage youths with no real goal in life will seek security in gangs and fame in senseless crimeswhether they be white or black black youths with little or no education will not be able to support themselves or their families but education is not the total solution college students both black and white north south east and west are looking bevoxid the ordinary education that will prepare them to earn a living they are looking at the whole moral fabric the past generations have woven in the u s and elsewhere in the world and they have found flaws they want a better world and they hav e been frozen out of any chance to have their suggestions sericusly considered they are rcevaluating goals and they are seeking new standards in the american way of life and through sheer numbers they are going to make their influence felt mr presidentelect we dont envy you with your senate and house connnittees controlled by and yearold chairmen w orking on legislation for a country in which the median age is years and these chairmen are named on seniority rather than merit the state of the nation d urincf the next few weeks mr presidentelect you are going to have to assess the slate of this nation you can start out on this disturbing note the eight years of the john f kennedylyndon baines johnson administrations have made two points quite clear first under the constitution and its amendments the negro eitizen of these united slates is legally entitled to each and ev ery right of any citizen second the u s is a racist nation with a hardcore of racist whites who will go to any extent including murder to deprive a negro of his civil_rights solely because he is black with this as openers you can go on to the problems of poverty the war education the youth explosion and the hmidreds of other problems that will confront a president you have taken a thankless job and wc wish you the best of luck c hristmas docs not have to be white thats the good tidings for black parents who during the next few weeks will search department stores drugstores and discount houses for suitable christmas toys for their youngsters leading educators agree that play is as important to a child as work is to an adult it helps him develop early concepts about himself his family and other people so it is only natural for a black parent to be concerned about what kind of play material his child has access to do the toys contribute to his physical emotional intellectual spiritual and social growth or do they stunt his development by implying that only wdiite is beautiful and legitimate in portrayals of human beings the latter was true for many years when the toy industry seemingly ignored the existence of nonwhite ethnic groups in the united states except for occasional bad guy indians in the wild west games most of the new toys on the market this year still cater to white customers even when a toy is ethnically neutral such as games trains and autos musical instruments appliances and building blocks the display box usually features white children only but there have been some important and welcome breakthroughs primarily because manufacturers are discovering that there is a great untapped market for blackoriented toys that an integrated toy industry may help negro children develop a sense of identity and racial pride is a fringe concern to businessmen but of major importance to parents sensitive to positive black consciousness so on christmas morning while the grownups chuckle over comedian godfrey cambridges new game easy steps to the white house their children can have fun with an ethnically correct negro doll with a broad nose and thick lips a black astronaut puzzles depicting integrated everyday scenes and even a wooden school bus depicting contemporar suburbia with one little token negro child among its passengers negro dolls are nothing new barbie the popular white teenage doll got a black counteqiart several years ago as did gi joe and most doll manufacturers keep one or two colored dolls in stock without exception up to this year these colored dolls were exactly thatdolls cast in the same mold as the companys white dolls but with a brown tint added this year however romeo one of the largest toy manufacturers decided that it might be profitable to develop a truetolife black doll remco hired a black artist annuel mcburrows to supervise the design of its new line of ethnically correct dolls and the result is absolutely delightful the venture has proved to be rewarding for the company tooaccording to the latest retail reports the black version of tippy tumbles is selling one to four compared to the white version and that is twice the ratio of blacks in the population in addition to tippy tumbles remcos realistic black dolls include babygrowatooth who docs that and much more growing sally who actually grows in size before your eyes and lil winking wiimy who even wears a simulated afro hairdo and has no white counterpart for parents who want to ny hlack in twery sense of the word it may he worthwhile to clkek the toys aailahle at the many stores speeializins in afroamerican arts and crafts tliat have sprung up in most major cities over the last few years many of them feature durable and attractive tows made hv hlack cooperatives for instance the poor peoples cooperative in mississipi markets a variety of toys from brightly colored clutch halls and hand ptippets to channing handmade stuffed dolls under the liberty house label books are not considered toys unless ihev talk or contain threedimensional material but thev r make excellent gifts and cdiristmas may be a good time to add some of the new afroamerican history books or truly integrated picture books to your childrens librar apart from the racial angle one can distinguish two trends among this years toys one is toward ever more sophisticated products there ar giant airplanes with jet engine drone miniature ovens that bake edible cakes dolls that do anything a real baly or child can dofrom blowing soap bubbhs and making handstands to speaking spanish an instant picture camera that takes real pictures a cartridge tape recorder pushbutton telephones and many other items that enable youngsters to imitate and prepare for tlu adidt world but there is also a dtfinite trend in the opposite direction toward socalled educational toys usually simple and robust objects without hidden mechanisms intended to dev elop the child s creativ ity and imagination t hree worlds inc whose preselected educational play materials are new on the market tliis year lists the following criteria for selecting toys the play material must be safe as well as fun also durable esthetic and socially helpful the child must be able to understand what he is playing with the play material must require a minimum of supervision it must afford midtiple uses it must be openended in that it leads the child to new worthwhile activities and disexiveries it must be appropriate for its indicated age group the child must be able to identify with the play material it must present a challenge but one that affords the opportunity of achievement it must provide real value for the price as far as value is concerned prospective toy buyers should keep in mind that toy prices vary greatly from store to store and that it pays to shop around for a brand name product recognizing the futility of maintaining any kind of price standard the manufacturers this year discontinued the practice of suggesting a retail price so the prices vary considerably from store to store it is interesting to note that issues that concern the nation at large are clearly reflected on the toy counters the reaction against guns and against the war in vietnam has caused most toy manufacturers to play down martial jmd destnictive toys this year gi joe for example seems to have been relieved of combatthis years accessories include a space capside and space suit a desert patrol jeep and a seaslide for exploring the depths of the sea space and science fiction are in however there are numerous space theme toys such as a gasolinepowered flying saucer star trek space ship models interplanetary heroes such as johnny apollo captain lazer billy blastoff and astro jack and robots of all sizes as in previous years there are dozens of new games many are modeled on tv shows and mo ies but aside from the previously mentioned game by godfrey cambridge which is primarily an adult game there is nothing that deals particularly with racial issues or features black people according to miltonbradley the game specialist many of their new products are geared towards family participationthe companys contribution to bridging the generation gap last year manufacturers sales of toys totaled more than billion dollars nobody has an exact figure on the retail sales but it was probably over billion dollars fiftythree per cent of that was spent in november and december in other words for christmas presents if the toy buying trend continuesand there is no reason to susdcct that it will notsales will increase by ten per cent this year that is a lot of money and it is up to the parents to see that the dollars are wisely invested in play things that will encourage their childrens emotional growth a federal juclje in illinois relates the following tale he has a black acquaintance who was stopped on the street by a policeman during the frisk the officer pretended to pull a knife from the mans pocket but a stranger had noticed the stop had observed the cop palming the knife and had warned the man when he realized the victim had a witness the officer passed oe his conduct as a joke the judge was asked what he did about the case nothing you can do he said and in cincinnati a concerned cop discusses the problem brutality he asks himself sure there is brutality and i mean physical brutality its bound to happen in a large force and does all around the country i see reports by patrolmen and they say something about the defendants head being injured while he was being escorted from the car brother what does that mean the thing that bothers me is that police continue to receive high numbers of complaints and there are only a few instances where the complainant is upheld they cant be wrong that muchand we cant be right that much like that lone officer from cincinnati almost every black man and woman in the united statesand those other millions whose long hair beads hillbilly and spanish accents and native indian habits mark them as dieerentknow that the people are not vrong that much and that the police are not right that much but in angr acquiescence like the stymied federal judge they tiini palms up and intone nothing you can do they are somewhat mistaken there is almost nothing you can do but there is a little for the individual defense against police harassment means knowing your rightsto silence to privacy to legal action against abusive officers for the group it means steady pressure on go ernmental officials to get rid of the bad apples and upgrade the habits and caliber of all other police officers and it means ocal outrage whenever an incident of police brutality becomes known while constitutional rights to tolerant police treatment in the street the home and after arrest may often be meaningless in this year of law and order and stop and frisk they still exist and can sometimes be called into play if a citizen insists upon them even in declaring constitutional the stop and frisk which has been in unautliorized practice for many years the supreme court this spring made clear that as far as it is concerned stops for harassment purposes remain unconstitutional however even though the supreme court condemned state courts for tolerating onthestreet police abuses much of its stop and frisk opinion in terry v state of ohio reads like the eoinment of the federal judge with the beleaguered black friend in ellect the court too turned palms up shrugged and said from a judicial standpoint theres nothing you can do in fact there is nothing the courts can do unless the citizen insures that the issues of police abuse are brought to court and the only way he can do that is to know and act on his rights key to the issue of police abuse in these late s is the fourth amendment to the constitutionnow applicable to both state and federal law enforcement agencieswhich declares in part that the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause that amendment embodies the harsh experience of those who wrote the constitution and its bill of rights in in boston a man named james otis cursed indiscriminate searches and seizures by british re enue officers as the worst instrument of arbitrary power ever found in an english lawbook because it placed the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer according to samuel adams the foremost revolutionary of that era it was in resistance to the searches of british revenue officers that the american revolution was born perhaps the most incisive discussion of fourth mendmnt rights came in from supreme court justice robert h jackson dissenting in the case of brnegar v united states said jackson these fourth amendment rights i protest are not mere secondelass rights but belong to the catalog of indispensable freedoms among depri ations of rights none is so effective in cowing a population crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror in every heart uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government and one need only briefly to hae dwelt and worked among a people possessed of many admirable qualities but deprived of these rights to know that the human personality deteriorates and dignity and selfreliance disappear where homes persons and possessions are subject at any hour to unheralded search and seizure by the police if the fourth amendment like much of the constitution were not historically tainted haing been foreclosed to almost all black people at the time of its adoption and for more than years thereaftct it might be one of the moral touchstones in the modem black movements but since the drafters of the constitution and bill of rights didnt mean us the fourth amendment and kindred protections remain only fragile tools which if they develop into effective legal instruments mav somedav be ratified bv black vmericans thev can however be used for many a street encounter with a policeman is emotionally trying even when the cops attitude is friendly a first principle in dealing with an officer as in facing any seemingly threatening situation is to keep a head policemen are constantly in danger and een the best ones may be jumpy and apprehensive if something has happened on the street and an officer asks you if von saw what occurred or if vou know soandso vou mav remain silent if you wish you may not however give him any false information that would help someone who has committed a crime escape if he asks in implicating tones what you are doing in the area you still have the option of remaining silent you can tell him what y ou iire doing you can tell him your name and address or you can tell him you do not wish to explain it is your option but it is better not to become surly even if he is an extremely important point to remember when a policeman sounds like he thinks you broke the law is to ask him quite directly whether you are under arrest the question is one of yoiir aces if possible make sure some other person potential witnesses hear you ask the question if the officer says yes ask him what for he is required by law to tell you if he rfuss tt t t words he uses and the people who o erheard him and he sure to make an issue of his refusal later on to your lawyer and in the courtroom if you are under arrest you need not answer any questions in fact by this point the officer is required to warn you of your right to remain silent if he does not you should remember his omission and make an issue of this also at a later time if when you ask whether you are under arrest the officer says no ask him immediately if you may go if he replies no to your second question you are in effect under arrest anavay you should answer no questions and expect a waniing of your right to remain silent anything you say could be used against you later watch your tongue if to your second question he says something like id appreciate it if youd wait a minute so i can ask you a couple of questions tell him you would prefer to go and if you wish tell him where he can reach you later if he still wants to ask the questions if he then tells you that you must stay consider yourself under arrest and keep your mouth shut you might however ask him again if you are under arrest the point is to pin him down on the question of arrest if you are not under arrest you are free to go and if you are not free to go you arc under arrest it is important that you remember the badge number of the policeman confronting you and what he looks like also remember what the witnesses look like and what everyone says also enicial is that you not nm away from the policeman considering the jumpy officers walking city streets today running away is almost suicidal resisting arrest even when you think the arrest is illegal is against the law and is guaranteed trouble the problem here is that the charge of resisting arrest is one that seems to be abused by law officers like disorderly conduct it is used as a catchall to justify detention and some local courts might find indications of resistance in een the most innocent acts scratching the ear might for example become cocking the fist the point is to stay cool and remember that some policemen are very nervous policemen have always had a right to search you if they carried a warrant authorizing the search or had arrested you now after last springs u s supreme court decision the officer has a right to search you if you look suspicious to him and if he thinks you look physically dangerous to him this is stop and frisk long used abusively against black people and currently the law of the land further abuse can be expected if a policeman searches you when you do not think he has the right do not fry to stop him you can tell him you do not give him pennission to search you then remember what he says what he looks like and his badge number thats about all if you are arrested and taken to the stationhousc you need not answer the questions of any policemen you should however tell them you want a lawyer and you should do so insistently do not answer any questions until the lawyer comes the police must allow you a reasonable number of phone calls to a lawyer or family member if you dont have change or the phone number ask the police for both if they refuse keep asking loud enough so that other prisoners may be witness to the fact you are being denied the right to make phone calls if you do not know how to reach a laxxyer call a friend or family member and ask him to find a lawyer if you do not have money for your own lawyer you ha e a right to a free courtappointed lawyer the right may be limited to situations where you are charged with a crime that could put you in jail but if you are without money to hire your own counsel ask for a courtappointed lawyer he may not be able to see you until just before you go to court but he will still be helpful do not answer any police questions or sign any papers until you have talked with the lawyer you have a right to meet privately with your lawyer and nothing you tell him can be used against you refuse to take part in any police questioning unless you have the lawyer with you the law requires that after arrest you have a right to a prompt hearing before a judge at this hearing or arraignment the judge will explain the charges to you and find out whether there is enough evidence to hold you he will also set your bail you should insist upon having a lawyer with you at this hearing a prompt hearing in any city where the courts arc sitting constantly means for all practical purposes the next morning if you are not arraigned promptly let the police know that you know your right to a prompt hearing is being violated if your initial encounter with the police is not on the street but in your home your rights are somewhat different you do not have to let the officer into the house unless he has a search warrant if the officer says he has a search warrant ask him for a copy of it tell him to slip it under the door or you crack the door and receive it make sure the warrant talks about your house if you live in an apartment tell him to have the owners agent or the landlord let him in but if he does not have a search warrant the landlord has no right to let him into your premises if the policeman at the door insists on coming in without a warrant do not try to stop him tell him you do not give him pennission to search your home and if you wish keep the door locked and make him knock it down for the purposes of a police search treat your car the same way you would treat your house if the police take anything from your house or car ask them for a receipt also you may later request a receipt for your property from the judge that issued the search warrant the seized items will be passed on to him by the police you should take careful note of the judges name on the warrant if you are driving your car of course the officer has a right to see your license and auto registration and if you are arrested for drunk driving blood urine breath and saliva tests are at your option if you do not want to take them you need not and if you want to take one ask for it the legal recourse available to a citizen when police illegally interfere with his rights is limited the most immediate and most effective recourse comes if the case goes to trial on evidence seized in violation of the defendant s rights in that situation the defense lawyer may ask the judge to throw out the evidence because it is tainted this is called a motion to suppress the evidence such a motion is a gamble if the judge rules out the evidence the defendant is in the clear but if he does not the defendant looks more guilty than he would otherwise if the evidence was seized with a defective search warrant a motion to quash the warrant will have the same ellect as a motion to suppress civil actions for damages against abusive police ofibcersfor assault and battery or emotional hurtare rarely available to a citizen according to kermit coleman ghetto project director of the illinois division of the american civil liberties union an individual can forget about suing a police officer unless he has been physically injured and if he has been physically injured his chances of recovery are much better in a federal cxurt than in a state court but if the citizen is convicted of a criminal charge it is not practical for him to sue an officer for injuries received while being arrested on that charge viien it comes to stop and frisk there is v ery little a citizen can do to protect himself its up to the honesty and decency of the officer coleman says and making it legal is hound to cause an upswing in the frcxjuency of abuse recourse against stop and frisk abuse includes the same weak options available in other incidents of police harassment a citizen can file a complaint with the police departments internal investigating unit although such bureaus are set up to investigate the publics criticism of police officers they rarely provide effective action because they lue part of the police department if an abused citizen has money he can hire a lawyer to investigate and take the case to court and if he has little money he can seek a lawyer at such agencies as the aclu the naacp legal aid societies local law schools and neighborhood law oflfices set up under federal government programs in the south there is also the lawyers constitutional defense committee a look at the record shows that while an individuals defenses against police abuse are flimsy recourse is occasionally available in tennessee in a black man beaten on the street and in jail by pohceinen recovered from the policemen on giounds of assault and battery false arrest and malicious arrest and prosecution in florida during that year a policeman was charged with assault to commit second degree murder after beating a black man in in detroit a policeman was charged with aggravated assault after breaking the jaw of a black photographer in new orleans in two policemen were suspended after the police chief learned they had lied about being assaulted by a black woman and in chicago this summer a policeman was convicted of murder after shooting a young white man but effective complaints against police are few and largely insignificant the individual is vulnerable and without knowledge of his rights defenseless the problem in police conduct is not the laws over tlie past years through progressive legislation in some areas and through high federal court decisions laws have become more tolerant of human differences and respectful of the individuals humanness as far as race is concenied every man has theoretically been set free on the question of crime the theorem that it is better to let a few sociopaths run loose than to punish innocent men has been largely accepted the laws are entitled to some deference even the supreme courts stop and frisk decision though a seeming capitulation to police harassment leaves room for considerable hope in the opinion the court recognized that present court controls of onthestreet misconduct are ineffective and to be condemned that a new form of police control must be devised and that the issue has not been fully analyzed by the court the last observation suggests that the court will speak again on police harassment and perhaps more charitably anomalously however enforcers of law have grown abusive in inverse proportion to the laws increasing respect for individual liberty the problem is primarily with people not the laws which are essentially only organizational tools it is the old problem of fearful immobility in the face of change but it is characteristic of human beings that when we stand still we move backwards and the task confronting enlightened citizens is to make the police obey the laws y ou can tnist football players over if they re still aroundbut chances are they wont be and if so

have a husband who likes to hunt encourage him to bag a small game bird or bring down a deer he should clean and dress it before you prepare the game for cooking because of the gamey flavor to most of these meats it is important to marinate and age them if you would prefer to buy your bird or roast ask our butcher about aging and cleaning in addition you should know the basic textures of the meat

at milton everybody in the cars just stared uiiccrtamly up the road they drove on through richmond and washington skirted baltimore and kept on highway until it connected with the new jersey turnpike outside wilmington del all the while mrs saylor was turning over and over in her mind the decision to uproot the family to abandon the home to leave family and good friends the town jobs everything she was her husband was not the best of ages she knew to start life all over again but they had talked this thing out and the reasons for the decision rode with her and back there in the other car with charles the four girls the move the saylors had thought would let them give anne catherine alice and louise just one more chance perhaps the last chance the girls were grownup and despite the sensation theyd created as the worlds only negro identical quadruplets and the years theyd spent as pet milk co babies on posters and in ads they were at tlie momciit poor tliey always had been for no matter what the piiblie thought the higlily publicized pet milk adertising contracts had brought in just enough money a month to keep the fultz quads off north carolinas welfare rolls now there was an emotional crisis the girls had spent two years at bethunecookman college in florida had been unable to adjust to campus life and had been advised to leave school they drove on up through new jersey crossed the tappan zee bridge into new york late in the evening and drove the miles along the hudson river on up to peekskill which is a quiet railroad commuter town not far from west point they settled in an apartment and have lived there in peekskill all the months since in halfsecrecy making almost no friends allowing no photos or interviews living with a certain bitterness trying to forget the disappointments that hae somewhat scarred their lives but ebony was allowed to breach their shield of anonjinitybecause mrs saylor says i guess its time we stopped hiding the truth we wanted so desperately for people to think that everything was all right and that we didnt have any more problems than the average family but we do and weve lived with them a very long time maybe if we talk about them it will help the girls the family lives in barclay plaza a housing project cut into the hills on the edge of peekskill its an integrated project and everyone gets along quite well only occasionally does a white mother run out and snatch her kid from among the black children playing inside the oldfashioned gazebo thats built on the project lawn the saylors and the girls have lived in barclay plaza for almost a year but they still dont know the names of the woman and her son who live next door they havent wanted to know anyone the lroom ajartment which costs a month is a fairly decent but toosinall place witli one small bedroom for the saylors and a master bedroom which is perhaps x for the four girls tlieres a modern kitchen and the living room has a pleasant little dining nook which features a fake brick wall everythings spotless theres not even dust on the lampshades its just that the place is too small six people in there tend to get in one another s way and on one anothers nerves id studied photos of the girls the baby pictures taken in annie penn hospital in reidsville n c where they were born on may the pictures of them with their seven brothers and sisters their mother annie whod been left a deafmute by spinal meningitis at two years old and their father whose name is james but whom white folks in rockingham county n c still like to call ole pete fultz there were the growing up pictures and the debutante ball ones and some of them in their high school graduation caps and gowns though they were supposed to be identical an observant person can spend five minutes with the pictures and be able to tell the girls apart now here they were in peekskill years old not as pretty as they were in high school not nearly as identical as they were in the old evaporated milk ads the disappointments have taken away a little of the softness from their faces the bitterness has affected each in some kind of way theyve all arched their eyebrows like women used to do in the s and their makeup is unevenly put on and two shades too white their hair which they do themselves is nicely arranged and their pink linen dresses fit well enough to show that tlieir figures are good the legs too are nice the fultz quads grownup now are what a lot of fellows would call tuff
were still fresh black americans were just beginning to get used to the idea of freedom few of them were able to pursue a higher education but already some black americans were reshaping not only their own country but the world seventyfive years before an african negro gave his heart for the first successful humanheart transplant an american negro performed the worlds first successful heart operation it happened on a cold windy night when a knifing victim was rushed to chicagos provident hospital the wound was a fraction of an inch from the mans heart under the medical conditions of the man was almost a sure goner xrays werent yet discovered blood transfusions were practically unknown there were no modern miracle drugs kentucky straight bourbon whiskey s yet with incredible skill dr williams attempted the long shot and his patient became the first man to survive a heart operation had it been any other hospital or any other surgeon the man might have died within the hour sewed up the human heart headlined a chicago newspaper that hospital operating room was a long way from the small frame house outside pittsburgh where daniel williams was born by the time he was twelve his father had died and his mother had deserted moving to wisconsin young dan scraped enough money together barbering to put himself through a local academy from there he went to chicago and with the help of a prominent family he graduated from northwestern medical school only eight years after graduation williams founded provident hospital the first infirmary open to all patients and physicians regardless of race or creed from chicago dr williams was called to washington to reorganize and head the freedmans f the old taylor distillery co frankfort louisville ky hospital then operated by the federal government he organized freedmans into departments collected a staff of twenty specialists and created the beginnings of a nursing school under williams administration this onceprimitive institution housed in precivil war buildings soon became the model for todays modern hospital even without that historic heart operation dr williams would have been considered a great man but that medical first put him into a very select class the class of truly ingenious americans would you like to own this handsome sculptured bust of dr d h williams its tallmade of antique bronze cast stone

appreciation for the tribute being given to the black soldier in the special issue of liuy i am hoping that this recognition will continue our students are er proud to read these articles and see the authentic pictures with captions that definitely reveal that we niiroes are fighting to defend our deinoeratic way of life and are giving our lises in order that we may enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness alice j gillespie registrar pinrij woods country life school piney moods miss lnoxy has iny respect for rendering the public service of accurately reporting what has existed and what now exists however i think it emphasizes a responsibility that falls upon your readers individually that is to make future such issues as the black soldier unncecssar for the reinforcement of their human dignity i tliink tliis responsibility weighs so heavily as to c ross over nationalistic pride into the icahn of personal commitment to the achievement of good conscience and i think the time to make just such a personal commitment is now before another generation of black soldiers arises to bear the arms of its fathers miss jcdy e cummings staten island n y as a member of the u s amiy i am compelled to express my sincere appreciation to you and your staff concerning your special edition of ebony the black soldier srt t w spearman fort camplyell ky the returning vet just completed your special issue for the month of august like the guys in your article the returning wt too returned from a war to find racial discrimination more evident than ever luckily i found a job but only to encounter not only from the white man but also from my own people constant heckling and harassment due to the fact that i returned from a war not with a chip on my shoulder but with the idea of building some kind of future for myself i know perhaps better than most that it is an injustice to have to scrvc in the armed forces of a country that denies the black man the very thing that he defends in some distant land how ever until w e the black man inject info ourselves some pride piiet dignity and selfimprovement to complement our anger wc sliall always be the lowest man on the totem pole my seven years of naval service werent exactly free of discrimination and pnjudices but i do find that in civilian life a black man finds little or nothing which prompts pride in himself or his work nothing to grasp only conditions that destroy his enthusiasm after a tour in vietnam you learn that regardless of where you may diein vietnam or on a garbagefilled street in the heart of some ghettoyoure just another sacrifice too sexm forgotten and mourned only by those closest to you johnny l gckiden jr philadelphia penna thanks infinitely for devoting the entire august issue of that great soul magazine ebony to the black soldier i specifically refer to the article returning vets the author did a splendid job in pinpointing the problems that the average black exserviceman encounters when he returns to that great american society i am one of these black vets having recently returned from vhetnam and honorably discharged from the army on jtdy fi while searching for a suitable job to support myself i have already had occasion to face the music again a man shouldnt call himself an equal opportunity employer if he doesnt intend to practice it because it is disjiisting to a black person who applies for a job takes aptitude tests and piisses them only to be given a flimsy excuse by the employer for his failure to hire him wakeup america lets show returning black and also puerto rican and mexicanameriean i veterans who often face the same problems as blacks that you really appreciate the endless toil sweat and sometimes tears that theyve spent in a foreign land for freedom by making a meaningful place for them in the american work force tcklays youthful veteran desires a job with a future and good pay is that too much to ask roukht cocaass newark n j blacks and the draft in reference to the special august edition of khony and mr mcleans article on the black man and the draft quote from the statements made by david bell the sxcc oireial who said he regarded prison as an honorable alternative to the draft but now after serving his two years in prison fecls he uok the wrong tajurse he said he felt he was rotting away there and that it was a ncgative experience and affected his whole personality we blacks here in the united states disciplinary barracks fort leavenworth kanand we are manvrealize the fact that brother bell resisted lhfore he was drafted however he must not forget there arent many alternatives that a brother can seek this is due to his economic and educational conditions one of the main reasons which lead to our being drafted in the first place some of us were willing to servo the two years in the uiilitar knowing we had strong convictions against the barbaric policies tliat this government is involved in at home and abroad we felt serving at least up until the point where it became impossible to do so any longer was our only alternative we sctved hoping we would never be called on for riot control or sent to vietnam and praying that vve could accept the discrimination and racism that we encountered in the military so we went into the nny and it led to our present incarceration here brother outside of headingnp this was our only alternative blowing this sick cliuntry is not as easy as one may think our roots are here the graves of our lynched murdered and gung ho forefathers are plantetl in this soil if we are to do anything to overcome our present conditions wf must start now to serve ourselves as a ihople we can no longer engage in the white mans affairs with any enthusiasm wt need not engage in them any longer w need massive changes and vve will never get them if wc continue our present course of servitude to the man we have long negiccted ourselves as a people a race a nation with brotherhocxl and unity we must begin to serve ourselves by catering to our ikds we must bring all our forces together if vve are to change ovv getting back to our brother bells statement of fteling frustration and ihcoming depnssed during his irtiprisoument i can say that this situation can occur when the pir son in confinement begins to become dejected and disconnects himself from his people

wouldnt expect the united daughters of the confedtracy to react with anything but piuidefaccd rage to such a suggestion but i believe the daughters of the american revolution in their fine and

concerning the negro in the armed forces was most enjoyable interesting and informative of special interest to me was your article regarding th senior negro officers of the armed forces because i was formerly a fighter pilot in the old negro air force and flew with it in combat during world war ii in italy also my brother col earl n franklin was one of those senior officers since i have been retired from the air force for two years it brought me up to date on mmiy of my old buddies and their present status your article omitted at least one full negro air force colonel who i know is still on active dutycol richard s harder harder is presently stationed at hamilton air force bilsc calif and is assigned as director of tlecommunications for the wistern communications region of the air force communications serxice command col harder rip to his friends for reasons known only to us of the old spookwaffe as it was fondly known during world war ii has had a distinguished career in the

lena horne at special thanks lor thi luly cover anil indepth story of my idol miss lena ilonii in i had the pleasure of meeting miss horne at the king of prussia shopping center she was doing publicity work on her autobiography tithd lena shes beautiful intelligent anti warm in other words shes rial william m boddy philadelphia pa when i read the lena horne interview i was reminded of benets lines from john browns body only a fool goes looking for the wind thit blew across his heart strings isterday in or was it lena might remember i attended a coektail party at the elegant newly decorated fairmont hotel in san francisco given by the council for civic unitv of which i was a member i couldnt liave been dragged to that party if it hadnt been that lena horne was the guest of honorradiantly lovely in a silver lame dress as i recall the guests were about equally divided between the races a sedate good time w as had by all and if any interracial marriages resulted i never heard about them my escort and i came away with a good feeling you might even call it a warm glow this is the way it should be and were getting there thus was rememlcr and to belong to something like the council for civic unity was to risk ixing called a communist at worst or a block buster at bst and ikwv lena says in her interview we got stoktdyas if that is the answer to the whole race problem what have we white squares accomplished by our donations to the united negro college fund and the naacp though shes married to a w hite man and so is her daughter it seems slie just doesnt think much of tliem meaning the entire white race sorry about that cocktail party lena mrs manney allexby washington d c i particularly enjoyed tlic article lena at i can still remember that miss horne graced the cover of your first issue and down through the years you have never forgotten her i feel every negro owes miss horne a debt of gratitude because even before it was fashionable stie rebelled against the system and lost thousands of dollars due to the fact that she would not sell her people out feel she should have a bit more credit for all of the insults and hardships that she incurred lxcause of her stand for dignity the negroes as a whole havent suppeen able to identify as white now that it has become chic to he black lena wants to identify as a black woman what a phony jean kara santa clara calif has lena flipped her cool she says how she cant actonly sing another thing she should learn is she cant think many of vonr articles are too condescending does it ever come to mind that many of us have some minds and think for ourselves lena tells how she changed her religion with less thought than she gives to changing her wigs lena docs not tell us about how she dragged lier children black its true into the white society why not you and lena should know that the geneticist joshua lederberg says it is scientifically absurd to call anyone in america black and probably not accurate to speak of whiles cither what a penalty lena has paid for her success as an artist read her report as a dull insipid and selfish report in summary lena and her life arc deadly boring the ixkr nitwit get her to start reading and thinking and keep this type of dull reporting out of your magazine rosa simpson princeton n j congratulations on your recent article lena home at she is still some beauty how about a followup series on her fans of long standing my husland who still is one of her most ardent fans really started me on tile lena horne craze years ago when the cotton club cab calloway tiny bradshaw earle father hines duke ellington and many others connected with lena wcre popular it would indeed be interesting to know what became of the america the known and unknowm fans of lena home and those who have followed tlie career of tliis great beauty it would be most interesting and a little unique for such an article to appear in your magazine how about it ebony ncedlcss to say i would love to be one of the contributors keep america informed and keep up the good work mrs r a kennerly new york n y the article by ponchitta pierce lena at in the july issue was wonderful i have iwcn an admirer of miss hunes talent and beauty for a long time along witli all the fame she lias accomplished she has accomplished the greatest goal of anyones lifetime she has found herself which is something that all of us are searching for mrs rosalie beckett clinton n c i am a young man of years of age and must agree with lena horne that the young black people are creating the clumge that is the change of racial attitude and the declining of bigotry that these united states have overflowed with but shamefully and sadly lena horne did not contribute anything to this change in all her years why is it that now she understands and praises the social characteristics of the black people why is it that now she is trying to convince the black public that she is a black woman why does she now feel the desire and hoiie to help black people surely lena horae did not gain such a prominent position yesterday she has been in show business for years she had the money and tlie name to help make white america understand and do something about the plight of black america being a human being she has naturally been exiiosed to the world and its social injustices why must she now feel that black is beautiful and to be black is to be beautiful cannot see myself or any black american accepting such hypocrisy as was slated by lena horne heyward fulton brooklyn n y we are very busy men in viet nam and dont have very much time to read today i and a couple of friends read your article on lena horne we cant begin to express how disgusting and sick it made us if ebony cant find anything better than that to print you might as well hang up your pen and inkwell we think its a sliame for a person to live for years before they have the courage to identify with their own iieople w curry ed

alike he became the link to a better tomorrow no american political convention in histor stirred as much contronersy produced as much bloodshed or deeloped such a crop of outspoken blacks but despite suffocating tear gas rumbling gi gun trueks and harsh security agents many of whom double checked credentials of blacks a new political movement was born weak kicking protesting and still far from maturity a century late black americans moed into the mainstream of the democratic party the tired champion of the poor labor and racial minorities jn terms of integration the democratic convention far outdistanced the republican convention in miami beach fla the gop boasted only the naming of the first negro senator since reconstruction massachusetts sen edward brooke as the temporary convention chairman the rolling into the millionaires paradise of the poor peoples campaign mule train and a race riot ten miles away in the desolate poverty stricken ghettos of miami clearly the oops national ticket selections vice president richard nixon and maryland gov spiro t agnew for vice i president and its law and order platform stance were not intended to woo the black ote the few negro delegates by actual counthad little influence in charting a positive gop course some compromised by enjoying the pleasures of a boat ride under the auspices of basketball pro wilt chamberlain a key aide of nixon many blew off steam by attending sessions of the concerned afroamerican republicans chaired by d c lawyer thurman dodson but the deliberations produced only an occasional news story and little action no such diversions sidetracked black delegates at the democratic convention even though labor sponsored a breakfast and the partys minority division operated a hospitality suite designed to coax the brother to give up his fight and peacefully work for the election of the favored democratic nominee vice president hubert ii humphrey against this backdrop of intrigue and compromise julian bond furiously battled for what he believedjustice for blacks weeks before the convention bond was reported to be a fulltime organizer for humphrey forces then as hhh team members were gloating over their admirable cateh bond held an atlanta press conference and announced that he was not supporting any candidate at the time naacpers in georgia demanded that georgia state sen leroy johnson and two other black legislators resign from the state delegation endorsed by gov lester maddox the three negroes refused and shortly thereafter supporters of sen eugene mccarthy circulated pictures of humphrey with his arm around racist gov maddox implying that hhh was a party to a political deal obligated then to show his hand julian bond moved clearly into the mccarthy camp in what loomed as a confrontation with veteran sen leroy johnson many feel that bond eventually will run against johnson the states first black senator and wrest from him control of the states black electorate from this underdog xosition bond became one of the main cogs in perhaps the most ambitious project ever devised to democratize the party that boasts of support by per cent of the countrys seven million black voters four years ago during the democratic convention in atlantic city the mississixpi freedom democratic party led by the naacps aaron henry challenged the seating of an allwhite mississippi delegation it lost the challenge but won a convention order that the mississippi delegation integrate its forces in the next four years or be disqualified as representatives of the states democrats atty joseph ranh of washington dc legal counsel for both the mfdp and its successor the mississippi loyalist democratic party cochaired by henry and newspaxer publisher hodding carter jr with charles evers as the national committeeman decided to press the case at the chicago convention after the regular mississixpi state convention failed to include sufficient blacks by this time the crusading lawyer was a strategist for sen mccarthy he decided that delegations from four other dixie statesgeorgia alabama north carolina and texaswere as unrepresentative as mississunis while officials of the labor move merit and the nacp refused to support rauh contending that a massive challenge would hinder the nomination of vice president humphrey the dc lawyer amassed a fighting crew including julian bond on a skimpy budget with problems of gathering a staff for research and legal defense rauh launched a whirlwind drie at a chicago press conference bond the challengers chief spokesman made the pitch following the initial and expected victory of the biracial mississippi loyalists said bond we immediately need to fight the remaining challenges our delegates are stranded in southern states without sufficient money to get here we dont have enough money to rent bises to bring our people here were maintaining headquarters in a ymca building the thrust was clear to every democratic official a coalition of blacks and whites was moving to smash the conservative dixie stranglehold on the democratic party the group was not backed by the fat cats or even the liberals who were supporting hhh reaction set in veteran black politicos began buttonholing black members of delegations and committees charging that the credentials fight was a mccarthy plot to wreck the convention joe rauh is trying to beat humphrey a black delegate whispered to a delegate this is a phoney issue so great was the opposition to the assault on dixie control that the credentials committee after seating the mississippi loyalist delegation sliced the georgia seats giving half to julian bonds group and half to gov lester maddoxs group and then quit a coalition of southern governors had threatened to withdraw support from vice president humphrey left without recourse were the leaders of challenging delegationsdr reginald hawkins of charlotte n c a dentist who had run for governor dr john cashin of huntsville ala who heads the national democratic party of alabama and editor curtis craves of houston texas who fought conservative texas regulars that had discriminated against mexicans and blacks these men were unsung heroes in credential committee hearings they cited case after case of blacks being denied participation in party circles they were a new breed of black politician who wanted a piece of the action and were willing to stand up and lx counted the convntion turned their cases down to aoid a headon collision with the dixie powerites who controling the party in their states elect the senators and congressmen that retain control of the most important committees on capitol hill above the din of compromise sell out and bribery julian bond kept his cool said an aide julians the man to watch he showed a courage and a maturity far beyond his age he helped inspire many a black who had given up and uttered let stokely take over he won the respect of whites who admired his leadership qualities in an atmosphere of confusion and turmoil although the democrats nipped the thrust of three southern challenge delegations the coin ention went on record as outlawing the unit rule a step that could be useful to blacks in coming years in the past the unit rule neutralized the power of black delegates forcing them to abide by the dictates of the superior white power asked to sum up the demise of the unit rule atty rauh said it was a one step win democrats beliee in gradualism times are too crucial lor such slow progress whether the democrats honor the commitment will depend on the next president it can become either an empty or a real victory as the spirit of julian bond revitalized elements of the party other blacks seemed to carry the ball in what probably could be called the most constructive yet disillusioning convention in modern times most blacks agree that their vote in crucial northeni and border states can decide the outcome of the coming presidential election but acknowledge there is no solidarity or cohesiveness to the vote for the first time a black caucusconceived by laborite bayard rustin but eventually taken over by detroit rep john conyers jr and gary mayor richard hatcherduring the convention and attempted to line up black delegates in a major effort to win recognition for the wants and needs of black ghetto dwellers at regular meetings the caucus members including a majority of the more than delegates from states argued about a needed platforman end the vietnam war plank and one to help ghetto programsand nomination of a ticket that offered hope to the brothers finally after realizing that the convention was in no mood to listen the black caucus endorsed rev channing phillips the first favorite son leader of a black dominated delegation from the nations capital as its presidential nominee and called for the relief of the st state of hunger a southern christian leadership conference goal for a few hours the black caucus sponsoring of the phillips presidential drive touched off a bitter votegetting race black backers of vice president humphrey and sen mccarthy zeroed in on other black delegates urging them not to throw away their votes on a losing cause the battle seesawed a black caucus member answered one of the critics with hes a brother let the world know were not satisfied let the country know the democrats dont have our vote in the bag at the lake tower motel on chicagos near north side where both the dc and the north carolina delegations were housed officials approved a dan moore for president on the outside motel sign moore is the governor of north carolina no such favor was extended dc favorite son rev phillips cracked a dc delegate were up against every kind of barrier but were not quitting in the home stretch favorite son phillips showed class holding daily meetings of his black and white delegates and alternates the yearold minister kept his home votes in line and wooed members of other statedelegations softspoken and dynamic the tall rangy militant hustled about downtown hotels politicking shaking hands and distributing literature even julian bond admired his tact said bond hes the kind of politician we need at the conventions nominating session the last minute black drive produced dividends during the vote tally dc favorite son phillips gained votes in the presidential race for a moral victory outclassing even north carolina gov dan moore who managed to eke votes not even a majority of his ovn state delegation from the first cpiestion of militant san francisco assemblyman willie brown during the credential committee hearings to the nomination of julian bond as vice president at the convention the chicago democratic meeting marked a new direction in black politics doomed in both parties is the accommodative process by which blacks have been relegated to supporting roles while the black vote has been captured through gimmickry promises of high paying jobs and the spending of thousands of dollars to caress black opinion the mood now is serious and determined black politicians believe the democratic process must work or this nation is doomed if the action is to leave the streets representative government must be the answer if votes are to replace bricks and firebombs the black man must have a rightful opportunity to participate in every level of both national parties and in policymaking roles in government the democratic conventiondespite the tear gas the heavy security and the rigging of procedures was a hesitant step in the right direction as one of the most outspoken blacks california delegate brown emphasized i represent the people of my district and every black in the land im not here to compromise or make friends this is the creed of the new breed of black politican this is the creed symbolized by bond d etermine not to be overtaken by events outside the nations conxent walls scores of black nuns got tlunnselvcs together at the first national black sisters conference held recently at pittsburghs mt mercy college the precedentshattering gathering was a weeklong affair that attracted black nuns from religious communities in states meeting under a banner of friendship and unity the nuns discusscd how tluy could make tliemselves more relexant to the needs of the black community they hoped to determine the nuns responsibility to their people their church their religious communities and their country in doing so they completely demolished all stereotyped views of what a nun is supposed to be vivacious energetic enthusiastic and friendly they wore many different kinds of habits from the traditional floorlength variety a minority at this conference to the calflength dresses and skirts spawned by the liberalization policies of vatican il some of them dispensing with their traditional headpieces proudly showed oft their naturals and a few nuns wore tikis next to religious medals while others wore buttons e pressing their pride in being black for an entire week the group listened to and questioned black_power activists educators students and social workers who offered their interpretations of what is going on in black america for the most part the discussions were lively and at times bitingly frank as the nuns and speakers confronted each other one panelist johnny clark a university of pittsburgh student set off an especially spirited reaction when he told the nuns we dont need vou you are irrelevant several sisters vigorously challenged his remark finally convincing clark that he was judging them according to his own stereotyped views when the conference came to an end most of the nuns left visibly buoyed by their newly affirmed common bond of being black c hief organizer and main spring of the pittsburgh conference was sister martin de porres a member of the sisters of mercy the confcrence was an outgrowth of her conviction that black nuns have a primar responsibility to assist in the development of strong viable black communities attended the black clergy conference she says and thought it a ery important step i felt that the sisters had a real need for the same kind of conference at the black clergy conference she was the only woman in attendance and she got in only through tenacity and daring two characteristics wliich became indispensable assets when she decided to organize the nuns conference initially she met slight resistance from some of the black nuns because as she put it they didnt understand the need for such a meeting and were fearful of what it might lead to she said that reactions from white nuns and church officials were on the whole unfavorable though many wished us well some of the bishops were saddened that we felt the necessity of calling such a meeting and of some letters we sent out to mothers general around the country asking their support only replied i think they felt that it might be divisive overlooking this lukewarm support she proceeded with the organizing of the conference it was important that we get together so we could ex aluate our roles as participants in the church and come to a deeper understanding of our own ieoples position and the creative tension now circulating in the black communities we also hope to help create ways of developing a living relationship between black and white the core of the racial problem is basically spiritual and this is where the cduirch claims that the creative power of god is effective taking a frank look at her church sister martin de forres explains the church is predominantly a white institution and it caters to white communities since white racism is behind the race problem then we as black religious women have to help white clergy and our white sisters understand white racism so they in turn can teach their people the truth she describes the mms conference as different from that of the clergy because our chief purpose is largely educational many of the sisters need to be educated more about the heritage of our people so they can teach it to other sisters and to the children she believes that black sisters should be given more power in black communities and that principals of catholic schools in black communities should if at all possible be black males on the touchy subject of race relations within the church especially between black and white sisters sister martin de forres obstmvs racism in the church is usually expressed in very subtle ways you might want to join a particular order and be told in a ery sweet oice maybe you wont be happy here and then one of the predominantly black orders would be recommended we must help the sisters to understand the attitudes within themselves about black people the mms saw no contradiction between these aims and the faet that nonblacks were not invited to participate in the confertmice it was felt that this was family business and whites presence might hinder the type of candid and open discussion aimed at in the meeting the attitude was one of we must first get ourselves together before we are prepared for conferences and dialogue with others despite their mixed feeling about the calling of the eonference many catholic bishops religious communities and private indiiduals contributed to it financially according to sister martin de forres some of the solicited donors sent contributions of one dollar without comment she believes they were trying to tell me something sister martin de forres is hopeful that out of the conference will come a deepening awareness of the contemporary moods of black people more support by the nuns for each other and successful attempts to create a positive liing relationship between blacks and whites the big remaining question is how far will the catholic church noted for its conservatism allow the black nuns to follow their new path concerned and interested black americans are waiting to see b eautiful dreams often come ill celluloid packages in darkened movie houses technicolor footage rolls out images of plush ilefneresque pads sleek automobiles and coy romances between beautiful white people two hours of fantasy for the price of one ticket this summer the silver screen adds a new ingredient to the recipea dream with a difference with a touch of black it s called for love of ivy and it concerns itself with the plight of a refined and very sensitive colored maid thrown together with a wily and at first nottoorcceptive black businessman who also runs a mobile gambling casino bv night her name is ivv she is intelligent and tired of cleaning up for a white suburban family who appear amazingly helpless without her direction where are the sheets kept frantically asks the mistress of the house while ivy calmly remakes a bed ivy has just announced that she will be permanently leaving the familys long island mansion to go to the city and take secretarial comses but ivy youre part of the family wails the wife we need you you should take a vacation well send you any place you want to go africa so begins this tale of woe and bliss for at the prospect of losing a maid who has been with them nine years the familys turnedon hippie children plot to retain ivy they find her a dashing black boyfriend who will conenientlv woo her after shes finished washing the dishes that will solve her case of wanderlust but ivij is more than just an amusing bit of fluff that this synopsis might suggest for it is the first film to feature blacks as ingenue and loer in a noncivil_rights oriented script and it offers two very talented black actors sidney poitier and abbey lincoln the chance to prove that comedy and dignity can be combined by now everybody has heard of sidney poitier but his costar enjoys a relatively select fame remembered hv some for her sensitive portrayal of josie in nothini but a man a shoestringbudget film with a big message and known to others as a jazz singer abbey makes her debut in icy to the masses of moviegoing americans off screen she presents a sharp contrast to the maid she plays with lier crown of bouffant aunaturel hair dangling earrings matched with flowing african dresses abbey brings with her an aura of soft femininity and black pride her eyes light up smiling when wouldbe critics point to the discrepancy between her role as a maid hair straightened and her reallife black militancy and beauty one reason i enjoy playing ivy is that for the first time a typical black woman is the heroine of a movie she explains like thousands of other black women ivy is a domestic her problems are typical of their problems her battle for independence is their battle and at tile same time the film is warm and fimny p erhaps it is ironic that abbey who once left a job as a domestic to take up a career should play an almost identical role on screen in the interval between her early days in show business and her triumph in i y she has gone through her own transformation from glamorstruck neophyte to a selfaware and proud black artist bom in chicago abbey grew up in kalamazoo mich because my mother thought a country atmosphere would be better for us kids as one of children abbey was then known as anna marie woolridge the girl with a pleasant voice in after abandoning a job as a maid she made her debut singing in a local club in jackson mich six years later she yielded to her managers advice and took on the name of abbey lincoln plus an unofficial bvline the colored bombshell i frankly didnt mind the name change she muses since anna marie was such a sweet name and i think people take on the character of the name they have liked abbey because theres more protection in it it seemed flexible and it swung the lincoln was kind of tongue in cheek but no one from the beginning ever got the connection the colored bombshell image was another matter abbey wryly recalls her first film the girl cant help it in which she appeared with jayne mansfield during one scene she wore the celebrated purple gown that marilyn monroe shimmied into for gentlemen prefer blonds got to the preiew and then i saw a black girl singing for a few seconds i wondered who that woman was then it hit that this was me i didnt like that at alir an introduction to drummercomposer max roach led to a new collaboration and a release from the sepia siren phase the now mrs max roach formerly miss abbey lincoln smiles thank god im not sexy anymore m ore than potential ivys among them a celebrated nightclub entertainer two wellknown dramatic stars a singer and a jazz dancer were considered before abbey was selected and despite her previous performance in nothing but a man abbey was among the last to test formally for the partand the one finalist who did not perform an actual scene for the test a misaddressed script sent to her never arrived leaving abbey unprepared for the next days film test when abbey arrived at the studio director daniel mann decided to film an offthecuff interview with bbey and sidney poitier ivys author tliis test and another look at nothing but a man convinced the films producers that in abbey they had found ivy it had been more than three years since abbey made a film and many critics like nat ilentoff voiced reservations about the plot of ivy as too shallow for her talents abbey dis agreed and even hentoff admitted that abbey brought a substance to the character of ivy watching the production he reported later i watched abbey film a scene ivy was shy but strong and i liked the way she stood as i left the set one of the pictures producers stopped me a prediction he said she will be the female sidney poitier abbey has yet to find occasion for reply t he catalyst in the development of the new selfaware abbey lincoln was a manher husband max roach max stirred up things in me id been afraid to recognize abbey says with a warm glance towards her husband he made me see that the abbey id been portraying was undeveloped that what i really had to give was far more important than just being sexy on a nightclub floor before i met him i was doing the same as most of our women without a man dothe best i could my relationship with him prepared me to play the roles of josie and ivy to be happy ever black woman in this business should have a warm mutualgiving relationship with a black man even the adoption of her dramatic natural hair style came about tlirough max although the folksinger odetta gave her a glimpse of what it was all about it was max who really awakened me to the beauty of wearing my hair in its natural state he came to see me on one of those damp nights in miami i always had to lock myself in my dressing room and go into that straightening bit this particular night i was tired so i just washed it and patted it down when max saw me he said baby i sure like your hair like that ive been wearing it natural ever sincefor almost ten years remembering she laughs there was a time when a black woman frightened peopleespecially other womenwhen she wore her hair naturally it was like we were letting out deep dark secrets some of my friends just knew i wouldnt be able to get more work abbey concedes that a black woman is beautiful no matter how she wears her hair but she is more beautiful in the natural state because she then compliments her man most black men have always worn their hair natural knowing her preferences many of her fans criticized her when she wore a wig in tvy and nothing but a man she had anticipated controversy but explains as an actress must be truthful to the character i am portrayingand the ivys in this country dont wear their hair natural yet after seeing the film one disgruntled black youth complained to a friend i wish she wasnt wearing that wig she looks more hke a soul sister in her natural wig or no wig abbey plans to choose roles carefully i feel i can better portray an african woman she states an artist reflects the personality of his people he is like a historian through which the soul of his people is defined she would not she insists accept a white or european oriented iart such as joan of arc a black actress in her opinion should accept only a role written especially for a black woman what kind of part does she prefer although critics applauded her tender rendition of josie in the tragic nothing but a man she found ivy just as exciting to play she sighs we have a tendency to always think of ourselves as a problem people there is more to our lives than just struggling with whites many playwrights wonder why black people dont come to see their plays in larger numbers they must understand that our people dont just want to see themselves being chased by bloodhounds and beating their breasts we need problem plays but we also desperately need some of the other kind like ivy abbeys present day acting enthusiasms tie in directly with another role she playsa real life one as the wife of max roach my first responsibility she states is to be the best kind of woman i can for my man and inspire him to do what he thinks is right the black woman will do well to show her man how wonderful he is hell take care of the rest for instance she says take her performance in ivy what i project on screen shows how much i have learned about mvself from a man a woman is what a man makes her being a career woman before i met max i had to unlearn a lot of things he is my guru as her husbands disciple abbey contributes the lyrics to many of his musical compositions critics consider tlieir most notable collaboration the freedom now suite an interpretation of mans inhumanity to man while working on this number abbey remembers max taught me how to scream he gave me a freedom i never had before and this was the true beginning of my aspirations to act as well as to sing so the former anna marie woolridge let it all hang out as she wailed screamed and shouted during her rendition of freedom now suite stunning blase supper club audiences ambitious abbey blinks her mascaraed eyes and thinks happily of what shell do next to follow up ivy as they say acting is in her blood despite her protests about the importance of being a mans woman its difficult to see her at home hanging up a wet wash apparently she agreesi already have another acting part in mind she admits its the story of the relationship behveen a young woman and a mature man of years she is the village belle and he is the chief with wivesand he still wins her i would love to play that role in the meantime she has a script to keep her occupieda play she is writing called streak o leon according to abbey the plot tells of a man who finds in small unmarked bills and decides to return it she got the idea from a headline story of a few years ago about a black man who found a large sum of money and returned it what with the aforementioned movie scripts plays and singing dates the abbey right now still comes on as a woman without hangups totally involved with her own artistic expression and with a full giving relationship with her husband as most successful entertainers can attest a combination of happy marriage and demanding career is hard to maintain but abbey seems to be doing just fine admittedly she has seen her troubles had her selfdoubts her failures she is no yearold kid bowled over by the rahrah hollywood movie star bitat least not anymore like most artists abbey feels that her performing style her future and her life will undergo more changes more transitions just as she herself went from colored singer to black artist but today at least she can say am a woman who has finally found some peace within myself s ometimes she sat in her metal folding chair staring with a halfsmile at one of the famous men who talked about law and order and such things as the democratic process and justice for one and all often shed look around at the funny donkey hats worn by people from nebraska and minnesota and at the gene and iihh banners that sprouted in the balconies she was especially fascinated by such democratic wheels as congressman john conyers and mayor carl b stokes for gail mchenry a slender yearold girl from hopkinsville ky the democratic national convention was all the things shed heard about in high school civics classes and read about in the handbooks and brochures shed received and there was a bonus as the youngest of all the delegates at the convention gail was one of the most popular people there radio and tv newscasters came over lots of times to ask what she thought about the history in the making there in chicagos old international amphitheater there were questions about the participation of young people in politicsespecially young black people and some people wanted her to talk about the yippies and the antiwar demonstrators being gassed and clubbed by national guard troops and chicago police gail who is a merit scholarship winner and thirdyear sociology student at indiana university handled the questions with the ease of a pro and surprised a few newsmen by being a little blunt some of my more mihtant friends think ive sold out she said but of course thats not true she had come to the convention for a reason she suggestedto work within the established political structure and learn certain things so that ill be ready when a black party is organized gail began her political career last july urged on by friends she ran for a delegates slot in her state where yearolds are permitted to n ote she won and she thinks that lots of votes came from people who rememhered the fine work of her fatlier louis p mchenry a lawyer naacp state president and congressional candidate who died last year she was elected in hopkinsville a western kentucky town just a few miles from the tennessee border and a town gail describes as rather consernatie and with a lot of george wallace supporters now what gail wants is the organization of the black grass roots people so that they can really obtain black_powerthe economic and political kind and gail was among the black students in indiana universitys afromerican student association who led a march last spring on the lu presidents home they protested the scarcity of blackoriented subjects black faculty members and facilities for black fraternities and sororities gails impression of her first democratic convention ill remember everything including the treatment of people both inside and outside the convention halla treatment a brutality that wasnt much different from nvhat black people have gone through for so many years in the south f rom may to july the poor peoples campaign converged on washington d c to challenge the nations economic structure to address the problems of poverty in america much has been written and filmed about the campaign but novv i vvant to submit my reflections on this phase of the struggle for human rights from its inception in the mind of dr martin_luther_king jr to the forceful closing of resurrectioii city the poor peoples campaign had an awesome task to help the nation determine its priorities in birmingham tlie southern christian leadership conference challenged americas priorities in relationship to its social structure in selma that challenge was extended to the political structure finally the time came to raise the economic issues to the conscience of the nation america had been alerted that million people a fidl onefifth of the worlds richest nation were living below the poverty level buried midst tlic tons of information was the fact that jobs were being lost to the labor market each week by technological advances in order to meet the growing anxiety of the american people the poor peoples campaign took up the burden of raising the issue of poverty to the surface of our national conscience and to expose its devastation in the lies of millions of poor people someone had to cry out for justice in a land that has placed priority on profits rather than persons someone had to ring out with clear moral authority that million people went to bed each night suffering physical destruction from malnutrition to acute starvation someone had to say that not only do we need jobs but that we also need a redefinition of work someone had to plead for a quality in life that offered wages but more importantly fulfillment someone had to demand that involuntary starvation should be a punishable crime in a land of surplus and waste but so often only the incidentals of the campaign were communicated to the nation such incidents included the record downpour of rain and the resulting mud in resurrection city tlie care of the mule iralb the mire and the inherent confusion in a massive task of building a city of many ethnic groups were amplified or irinted out of proportion by the news media thus the general level of the nations insensitivity and unawareness was in part attributable to a press that deals often in sensationalism personalities and in protecting big business and the press preferred toprint apparent feeling about the death of dr_king and senator robert kennedy rather than focus upon the issues damning the idoor to hungering insignificance thus a nation largely uninformed was challenged to judge the personal beha ior of poor people rather than the collective behavior of the congress given the press preferences for problems of process rather than the purpose of the poor peoples campaign the adversaries of the poor exploded those problems out of proportion in order to avoid the issues of inequity in our economic structure from mud to personality differences in resurrection city occupied their time rather than the cries for food jobs and opportunity that brought resurrection city into being but a new idea was moving from the excitemcnt of conception to the fermentation and growth to the laboring pains of anguish when moments of history yield forth new life gathering of the poor what was the difficulty the pain involved pulling together all of americas poor the indians the puerto ricans the mexicanamericans the poor whites the poor blackseach of whom had been taught that the others were enemies historical circumstances forced each group apart and structured in each disrespect for the other we had been so obsessed with competing with one another for the few jobs and privileges at the bottom of the economy that we dared not threaten our status with too much public or political identification we thought competition was our most effective tool when cooperation is our real challenge many of us had analyzed our problem to be simply race when in reality race is only a part of the problem class is another part of the problem there is an inherent contempt that the economic system holds for the suppressed at the bottom of the economy yet the economy of the nation rests upon the shoulders of the oppressed the first meetings of these different ethnic groups were exciting but tense the groups were full of fear and mistrust of one another bullhorn in hand rev lackson leads niiirch left of poor people to capitol for presentation of demands to congress rijiht at washington airport he confers witli sclc president reverend dr ralph d abernatliy each group felt that it had a monopoly on pain and suffering so meetings were long as we bore with one anothers sermons on the effects of particular aches and pains this was a period of anxiety when each group began learning to appreciate the other to gather information about the other with our blackwhite analysis few of us realized that there arc more poor whites in numbers than poor blacks but in percentages more blacks are poor than whites few of us really understood the insignificant role relegated to the poor white class by the rich white class we realized that blacks are a despised caste within the poor class but at least we were a caste which the system calculated to make us suffer but allow us to live while blacks were slated to be ground up by the economic system based upon slavery and eliminated as the technological development of the system rendered them unnecessary the ultimate destiny of blacks was genocide spread from generation to generation seldom do we realize that black capitulation to the tyranny of the slave system provided us the means to struggle for our survival midst our suffering and our destiny to die white people concluded that a good nigger was an obedient nigger and they taught us that obedience was better than sacrifice thus we developed survival techniciues that included acting docile and meek even though we always felt differently uncle tomism became for us ah involuntary state of existence developed for survival at the same time americas indians were destined to instant genocide tribe by tribe day by day the indians with their strong sense of identity and pride were confronted by the forces of tyranny invading their lands and their homes thev remained anticolonialist and contended that their land had been taken and for this they were driven from their homes to reservations in the desert regions to die rather than into ghettos or colonies to work so anticolonial were their actions that white people concluded that the only good indian is a dead indian another technique used upon blacks but not upon other poor minorities vvas social integration we integrated from pain and brutality and humiliation not toward joy and fulfillment blacks have never been covetous of the talents or souls of white folks only whites privileged status and social protection appealed to blacks our total uprooting and separation from our tribes languages culture and land is the fundamental reason for our actions as blacks we were taken from our land and brought here we experienced the whites as rapists of our dignity on the other hand the indians sense of nationhood or peoplehood is responsible for their collective behavior for freedom or death the indians and the mexicanamericans expcrienced the europeans as rapists of their land in resurrection city the poor whites began to see how they had been used as tools of the economic system to keep other minority groups in check perhaps the poor whites were the most tricked of all the poor in that they are in the same economic class as the others their problems are basically the same in fact as ours a need for food jobs medicine and schools however they were given police rights over niggers a plan which satisfies their sick egos but does not deal with any of their basic problems it was in our vvallowing together in the mud of resurrection city that we were allowed to hear to feel and to see each other for the first time in our american experience tliis vast task of acculturation of pulling the poor together as a way of amassing economic political and labor power was the great vision of dr_king a certain shift in mood and focus was an inevitable byproduct of the poor peoples campaign the focus was class primarily and race secondarily since the issue of hunger cuts across all poor groups the go to congress with an essentially moral argument he argued that separate facilities were politically unsound economically unprofitable and morally incorrect in other words he took advantage of the crisis created by the civil_rights movement to assert a decent position and to educate an insensitive sick and indecisive nation for this position kennedy was ridiculed and perhaps killed but his ability to capture the forces of history to put them in perspective and to choose the right one made him a champion of the poor and a friend of mankind it is understandable politically though not morally right that if the people are asleep and congress is awake the president will gravitate to congress but if the people wake up and cry for help and are sound in their needs they have a right to expect help from the president whom they elected to identify with them during this period of crisis but the poor peoples campaip was brutally ignored president johnsons behavior toward the poor does not indicate that he is mean but it does reveal that he is sick or neurotic a blatant characteristic of the neurotic is his need for total agreement on his programs when the president found the poor at his doorstep crying out for justice he could not hear their cries piercing his demand for quiet obedience and thus he dismissed them the nations chief executive is unable to bear what the cerman philosopher hegel calls the mark of the thesis and the antithesis in his own person he is unable to cope with diverse opinions with the capacity to blend those views for a higher svmthesis and the presidents lack of leadership stifles creativity in such a way that it creates a gulf in leadership from the white house to the neighborhood in addition to encouraging despair among the poor who sought to relate the president took away another tool blasted another hope and rejected another opportunity to kindle the dreams for a healthy nation the net result is another lessening of faith in america yes there is a problem of the lack of leadership but it was not from the poor black house it came from the rich white house placing the blame much of the contextual criticism of the poor peoples campaign was absurdour timing our strategy and our audacity if there is to be any blame it must be put squarely upon our friends on the left and the executive offices of the government those on the left tended to deal with the symbols of change represented in how one looks rather than in the substance of change evidenced in how one behaves they mouthed the words of radicalism in their criticism of the economic system but their lives are based upon the prerogatives of that same unjust systemeducational opportunities jobs food distribution taxation travel housing and so forth the socalled friends on the left were unwilling to challenge basic premises of american economics since such actions appeared to threaten their ovvm faorcd ways of life for the benefit of the poor simply stated their characters were not in fundamental conflict with the present system thus their protestations of liberalism were essentially irrelevant others on the left had no feeling for our diseussion of hunger in america their tables overflowed with the abundance of americas produce and their stomachs were consistently full they were unable to recognize or relate to starvation and malnutrition in this rich land their incapacity demonstrated their vast distance from the poor the left spent their intellectual energy on revolution but were unable to discuss food for the hungiy some of the traditional more fundamentalist white churches never confront the government they shuck their responsibility by transcending the reality of confrontation in fact they have rendered everything to caesar and nothing to god thus eliminating their opportunity to feed the hungry and heal the sick many of the major white church leaders who marched with dr_king and who cried crocodile tears at his funeral for his dream to be realized could not find the ego satisfaction to walk with dr ralph abernathy their hypocrisy wws damaging to our struggle the right or more conservative wing congress included challenged our right to admit there is hunger in the land secretary freeman and congressional committees argued with cbstvs documentary on hunger usa freeman literally became the us goodwill ambassador running around the country to the joe bishop show and many other shows stating that the poor are not hungry they are just suffering from malnutrition black and white workinr together symbolized a purpose of resurrection city the pulling together of all of nations poor in loint protest of their condition the poor peoples campaign had the task of approaching the president and congress not of invading them with an arsenal of arms to force change but of pulling the cover off the critical conditions of the poor in america by doing so the general public has the opportunity to see the state of our nation and to demand explanations and programs from their representatives sclc has assumed such roles previously along with the coalition of civil_rights organizations sclc pulled the cover ofl segregation in public facilities in tlie south then the nation condemned what it saw the civil_rights bill was passed again in selma the co er was jerked from voting restrictions and the nation responded with tlie oting rights bill in both the birmingham and selma movements the northern politicians were not injured or even threatened in fact the civil_rights legislation strengthened them in the following ways it increased the power leverage over the southern political bloc it further aided the northern liberal image and it did not cost the nation anything nor did it expose any of the graft of the northern politicians those civil_rights bills did not affect the selfinterests of the northern politicians they debated the right of the south to humiliate black people but there is little debate on the fact that the mass black vote is needed in the northern cities while the desires of the rich financiers are heeded dispelling myths certain other myths were dispelled by the poor peoples campaign for example we have broken the myth that the poor arc poor because of laziness and indifference the fact is the poor work the hardest the longest and perform the nastiest chores but the rich have the resources for imagemaking to determine how people view one anothers plight so smooth is this apparatus that vicepresident humphrey can make a passionate plea for nonviolence on television and express it as a part of the american tradition but in fact our tradition is violent a violent breakaway from britain the violent extermination of the indians the violent debasement of afroamericans the violent seizing of land from tlie mexicans and violent war policy in vietnam america can no longer live behind the lies of her myths the vietnam war has clearly revealed that the decisions for war and peace are made by the upper classes but the dead and the dispossessed arc found in the masses the trick artistry of imagemaking can force the poor who built the nation for little pay to apologize to the rich for being poor and can thus make the welfare system seem like a privilege when it is a right v perverted report of history creates a perverted course for the future truth must be our presupposition if freedom is our destination the fourfifths of the nation who are eating abundantly and wasting sinfully are too ready to conclude that the bottom onefifth the nations poor are poor because they lack the will to work such images and impressions do not match reality the fact is that there are fewer jobs for the poor to perform employment for the unskilled is a scarcity and our educational svstem is not perfonning in proportion to the need for skilled workers and technicians thus the poor cry out for jobs the need for skilled labor grows but the educational apparatus has not closed the gap between the two at the same time our national military policy calls for trained trigger fingers while our domestic crisis demands enlightened minds whose fault is it that elevator operators small farmers ditch diggers and railroad porters are out of work certainly not the poor but an increasing advanced economic system based upon technology from the policymaker to the poor person we are realizing that we li e in a new world where old concepts have little meaning concepts such as time and space hae emerged with new meaning for example we no longer ask what is the distance from chicago to new york new york is not x miles from chicago but is only one hour and forty minutes away in this instance the jet plane has rendered time more important than the amount of space to be covered between two cities some economist predict that in twenty years percent of the population able to pnroeiiough goods mid services for remainingpercent of the nattpn one cannot calf percent of the nation lazy but such predictions show that work must be redefined to go to college and to prepare for the nations brain trusts to raise our children to clean our homes are all forms of work for which compensation is needed and our economy can afford it the nation must exert effort to realize creative answers to the job question some policy makers and businessmen have called for one million new jobs in a short period of time but the loss of jobs per week renders one million jobs less than helpful in a matter of weeks the production of abundance in american capitalism is unprecedented progress but the maldistribution to the lower onefifth of the population is a crucial defect in the economic system unless this flaw is dealt with soon racism will become even more intense tlie racial polarity is strongly proportionate to the rate of unemployment and either our top heavy government will reassess its relationship to the sweltering masses and take care of their welfare or inev itably those masses will say farewell to that government the poor will voice their positions in perhaps muted and unclear forms but the disenchantment with a meaningless government will become visible it may take numerous fonns some of which are evident now such as the antiwar crv vouth vacating the country to avoid the draft low voting percentages and others violence or nonviolence another issue in focus is the philosophy of the movement whether it is v iolence or nonv iolence nonviolence as an antidote to violence is undebatablv the soundest and most humane philosophy but the circumstances under which poor people struggle make it difficult to absorb as a medicine mans drive to surv ive is stronger than his drive to he ethical or moral the intense pain and misery in the ghetto rings out louder than the politicians admonitions to be patient and to wait for relief the cool head and the collective discipline required for nonviolent warfare is difficult to teach and to practice under such fiery conditions the audacity of a wellfed man telling a hungry man to wait is challenged the voice of a secure man talking to an insecure man whose existence is a disregarded digit is hardly heeded these gaps between the healthy and the ill define the vacuum of leadership and communication that are growing nonviolence as a science not as a mechanism is designed to overcome these barriers but the task grows greater daily it will also prove to be the most potent weapon in mans struggle to be free but the burden upon nonviolence increases related to nonviolence the question of cowardice must be reexamined and redefined cowardice cannot be associated with a man standing on a balcony in memphis without fear witlioiit bodyguards the coward is he who throws a rock from the midst of a crowd then hides his hand or he who pulls a trigger then drops his gun america has an illusion of protection which must be dispelled there is no military protection against ambush assassination or sabotage in a sick violent society president kennedy was surrounded by an army and robert kennedy had his bodyguards but the contagious disease of violence is not simply carried in a gun the disease is in the air it poisons the atmosphere and each person who breathes is subjected to it we must be concerned with the atmosphere of violence which drives americans to produce and purchase the weapons of violence victories won finally we must ask if the poor peoples campaign was victorious yes we gained victory in the few concrete programs that passed through congress such as the ayear food program but more importantly our victory was bigger victory is revealing the state of hunger in america victory is exposing the scandalous agricultural subsidies to the rich victory is the evolution of human sensitivity and consciousness to our brothers predicament victory is the renewed determination of the civil_rights movement after the assassination of dr_king for though the dreamer is dead the dream lives on victory is the poor of all races coming together victory is to be ignored by the political power of the white house but to have the capacity to respond with the soul power of the black house victory is the new relationships created and the lessons learned history is on our side the arch of the universe is inclined toward us in its pathway toward justice resurrection city cannot be seen as a mudhole in washington but it is rather an idea unleashed in history the idea was germinated in the mind of dr martin_luther_king carefully cultivating it he delicately planted it in the hearts of men on his last great tour the idea has taken root and is growing across the country on april th dr_king walked away with god and did not have time to recover the idea unleashed because of his life this nation will ne er again be the same i n houston race relations image is king and during this decade tlie powers of the city have stayed one step ahead of haoc keeping tlie sheen of oil wealth and texas cosmopolitanism untarnished when the civil right legislation took fleet houston feared a bad name of the sort won by birmingham atlanta and jackson but the businessmen of texas largest city beat that threat quietly and swiftly the technique that time was the dubious one available only where the local press works closely with the power structure the city was integrated and only afterward did the papers talk about it now houstons delicate image is menaced anew by a brand like that scorched into the records of newark detroit and watts and again the businessmen have stepped forward this time the plan is bold unique and provides room for real racial progress grasping at straws with time running out they may have plucked one of the riglit ones they have injected psychotherapy into policecommunity relations psychotherapy in this case means something more than freud and leathtr conches it means the new psychology of tapping human responses usually suppressed in everyday life and of dispelling stereotyped perceptions deadly to communication it is psychology with a social purpose which in houston means controlled verbal confrontations among blacks mexicans whites and policemen of all three ethnic groups the sessionsthree hours long once a week for six weeksare basically group discussions however conversation is not random it is focused on the most proxocative subjectspolice beatings liate namecalling interracial couples riots fearby psychologists who encourage both expressions of hostility and sulsequent reconciliations the psychologists also punctuate the discussions with the special events of group therapy role reversal and psychodrama a militant black and a white policeman might be prompted to exchange roles and continue an argument or the two might be asked to dramatize their points of view by acting out a fictitious confrontation supplying their own dialogue tension often runs high and participants have occasionally walked out others have abandoned the program but most catch on that the rewards of the therapy depend upon the pain of the sessions the program nearing completion after a years operation has attracted national television and the national press the coverage has intensified the citys image consciousness a helpful effect and less helpfully has overblown the expectations of a project that is essentially experimental albeit a prototype of what every city needs network television portrayed the experiment as shockingthis may shock you abcs offering beganand focused on the heat of the therapy sessions policemen and policewomen black men and women joined by mexicanamericans and random anglos shouting at one another admitting bigotries and jaded perspectives the press played the project as hopeful and looking for results found only the great rapport between the black director of the project and police officials indeed few results appear on the surface other than the group catharses and the cooperation among the black and white men who run the project the houston experiment eannot be measured with the quantitative precision available to most race relations programs there are no emdloyment figures to compare no housing statistics no changes in income only attitude changes measurable in subtle alterations of behavior beforeandafter tests of police attitudes have been tried and have shown that at least so far as answering questionnaires is concerned police tend to lose some of their prejudices during the therapy but the va psychologist who conducted the study cautions that the test results do not necessarily indicate a reallife change a study of community participants is not yet completed nevertheless houston mayor louie welch inferring from intangibles is convinced that the program is in large part responsible for the citys comparative racial calm over the past year and dr melvin p sikes the program director assaying offthecuff reports from both the black and blue minorities is satisfied that the new communication has yielded social contacts and in some cases friendships where previously there were none other psychologists in the project some glietto militants the citys human relations council director blacks active in their communities and outspoken police officers also see benefits when asked to name them they cite simple human encounters which they have witnessed or experienced unspectacular but new to houston while not everyone has kind words for the project there is enough satisfaction to make it an elusive success the policecommunity relations program formally entitled the houston cooperative crime prevention program is the brainchild of dr blair justice a rice university professor who serves as community relations consultant to the mayor it came on the heels of one of the countrys worst racial confrontations an event known locally as the tsu incident or just tsua pitched gunbattle between houston policemen and students at allblack texas southern university according to dr justice who conducted community studies before and after the tsu tragedy in which one policeman was killed two police and one student injured black hostility toward police grew manyfold after the incident justices own reaction was to attempt a rapprochement between police and the black community justice convinced the mayor that psychologically oriented wellstructured group confrontations between the disputants would be an effective sedative for a jumpy houston he and the mayor sensing that time was running out rallied of the citys most prosperous businessmen and with little delay secured private pledges large enough to get the jrogram started as of august the businessmen had donated about the program began very rapidly the tsu affair occurred in may by october the therapy sessions were underway everything happened so fast justice says that we didnt really have time to consult the police chief when the chief was informed of the plan justice adds it didnt go over too well the program is the first to confront policeminority group problems with something other than lectures selected to direct the program was a black veterans administration psychologist dr sikes a native of gary ind and a graduate of the university of chicago he was chosen justice acknowledges because in addition to his competence he had no affiliations with black organizations to which reactionarv southwestemers are so sensitive under sikes guidance the program took shape the techniques usedrole reversal psychodrama the building of images in homogeneous groups and the testing of them in heterogeneous oneswere drawn in part from a procedure used in unionmanagement disputes and in part from a small scale local university project for texas schoolteachers the aim has been to expose all of houstons policemen to the program with extra pay as an incentive to attendance two hundred at a time they follow a characteristic patteni through the sessions first denying their prejudice then meeting hot words with hot words admitting some bigotries and finally opening up to explain their problems as a idlue minority community participants typically begin with stereotyped images of police as brutal authoritarians but finish suspecting cops may be human after all and in some cases good men at that despite the policecommunity program howe er houston in sikes view is susceptible to flaming racial violence the potential for which is keyed to police conduct if we have any difficulties here he says it will be a police incident his opinion of the citys volatility is shared by justice and john p murray human relations council director both of whom note that prior to mlks assassination all of the countrys ghetto rioting was triggered by police but houstons situation is more threatening than most sikes insists because the friction is not acknowledged unlike chicago where racial tension often seems an atmospheric factor houston is outwardly a place of racial peace sikes claims the calm is phony obscuring deepseated hatreds here it is underground he says they say we have no problems its not like chicago here you cant talk about escalation and ways to head it off houston is moving but its just getting started tlie problems of the policecommunity program in itself one of houstons prime movers illustrates the habits of dense but quiet suspicion that weight the city much like its windless humidity the program began at an inopportune moment coinciding with a local election campaign and with the opening of the mcclellan hearings in washington because the program was identified with mayor welchs reelection campaign it was dismissed by many blacks as pap and because mcclellan began his chastisement of po erty programs by subpoenaing houston militants conservative houstonians retreated fearful that progressive racial action would place them in the illdefined quicksand of unamerican activity the police were wary until they found out we were not going to nin their department jack murray explains while rights and militant groups gave us the sound kiss of death although they had been clamoring for this kind of program the withdrawal by the militants irked that they were not included in the programs formidation and fearful that it vvould be another halfbaked expression of the white middle class placed heavy burdens on community recruitment the program murray says had coimted on established black groups to bring in the community a chore that loomed heroic from the beginning many blacks murray notes were annoyed that policemen would be paid to attend while they would not and in addition had a natural hesitation and fear about going to the police station to participate the project got off the ground he says because several interested black citizens undertook the recruitment job themselves and because the sessions were moved out to locations in the city closer to the people the reluctance of newspapers and churches both white and black to involve themselves in tlie program cinched another pathway for recruitment the climate of suspicion has continued to hug the program throughout its operation ten months into the experiment sikes and murray have begun to utter the sounds of houston speaking apprehensively of birchite infiltration alert to the welldressed white community participants who side with the police and take notes in the therapy sessions and police inspector c w taylor who contrar to the rhetoric of national politics insists upon a clear distinction between the crime rise and racial violence expresses the fear that members of the extreme rightbirchers kkk and sympathizersare getting to some houston policemen like sikes taylor regards the major boobytrap in the police department to be a small per cent they saybut extremely hard core of oldline racist thinkers who cannot be touched because of civil service protection taylor thinks most of the houston department share his enthusiasm for change even though the pressure of the hard core silences all but the most courageous wary voices come on even stronger out in the ghettos young men from a group called souls unlimited fear that the policecommunity program will accomplish only a change from overt to covert racism perhaps its better for them to be overt one of them says rather than hiding behind a curtain and doing their dirty workthats whats happening in the sessions many young men in the group have had violent runins with the police one points to a scar on his upper lip which he claims is the legacy of a police beating i am convinced the only reason they beat us is because they hate us he says i dont think the police department is going to change the wariness of blacks sikes notes prov okes many to abandon the program after a few sessions they stay just long enough to get a bad taste and are reluctant to return because they dont trust the chief police chief herman short but the distrust of the souls unlimited seems to run not only to the chief but to police in general some of the young men think that participation in the therapy sessions might expose them to reprisals but many attend anyway one man maurise brown says that the program might do some good with a few cops but otherwise its no good theyre not going to change many claim to know of police beatings within recent months and become particularly incensed when discussing the early august beating of the wife of lee otis johnson one of houstons most outspoken militants and although the souls acknowledge that policelaws in their vernacularhave been exercising more restraint recently than heretofore they do not trace the change to the policecommunity program the change they say has come because police have learned black people will not take abuse without reciprocating modulated skepticism comes from the staffers of hope inc another ghetto group and the only one addressing itself exclusively to pearl harbor the citys most desolate area while hope presents no unified opposition to the therapy program it is clear that the group regards it as tainted by the involvement of the mayor and police chief and although the editor of hopes newspaper bubbha tliomas views the project as a welcome tranquilizer the organization recently submitted to the city council a petition signed by citizens complaining of police brutality in pearl harbor thomas who unlike most of the hope people has attended some of the sessions says he was gratified to see a policeman he had met in therapy go out of his way to assist a fallen black man one of pearl harbors winesoaked ghosts yet for all of the hope staff the beating of lee otis johnsons wife coupled with other reports of beatings far outweighs the good will of one policeman meanwhile back at the station house chief short explains his own brand of skcpticism he insists there arc dangers in using the words therapy psychotherapy or sensitiviw training to describe the program his policemen have entered someone miglit get the idea were like those people i read about sitting around naked getting to know each other he says apparently referring to novel california programs like that of the esalen organization and after describing the police program as good for making contacts he slumps back into tough talk declaring that despite therapy were not going to sit by here while rome bums or houston either for that matter hopefully the chiefs apprehension mns only to the connotations of nudity he finds in the clinical language but one of his desk top displays suggests otherwise on the outer edge of the otherwise bookless glass expanse along with a nameplate a model of a hound and a hand grenade rests a volume by dan smoot the rightwing pamphleteer who has proclaimed democracy a perversion of the founding fathers intent negroes an inferior people and texas homeboy ltidon johnson a traitor but despite the carbuncles of anxiety that seem to grow on everyone in houston the policecommunity program is having its quiet successes as sikes says theres been enough so that we know there can be more hilton lewis a retired postal worker and active black leader who has lived in houston all his life has kept a close eye on the conduct of policemen on the streets since the therapy programs beginnings he has noticed changes some policemen he says now try to make their beats social as well as business patrols they can be seen stopping their squad cars getting out and talking for no apparent reason other than meeting black people the behavior contrasts with traditional houston police habits according to which some young black men report the presence of a squad car meant an arrest inspector taylor cites some changes occurring inside the stationhouse not only have black and white officers begun to exchange social and friendly talk he says but some of the black officers have commented with surprise that now white policemen often initiate the echanges before the program taylor says the communication was strictly limited to businessbubbha thomas relates an incident that increased his faith in the program recently he says a policeman visited hope inc s offices just to talk just to see the black art on display just to watch the presses it had never happened before and the policevisitor thomas knew had participated in the policecommunity program mayor louie welch reports that the number of police abuse complaints to his office dropped radically during the past year simultaneously he adds black people have begun to report more crime against themselves the latter phenomenon he interprets as an increase of black confidence in the police rather than an increase in crimes against negroes sikes himself constantly encounters signals of changed attitudes a familiar figure in the police station and being an open man easily approached he is frequently the recipient of policemens enthusiasm rounding a ewner in the station house during a visit to the chief in august sikes was nailed on the spot by an officer who had in effect taken the spirit of the dialogue sessions home with him the officer had begun to rally groups of blacks and whites in his home for continuing discussions and wanted sikes to drop by even some of the militants think the program diminishes the frequency of hostile encounters but because their understanding of race relations is largely in terms of attack and counterattack they acknowledge the program for their own reasons specifically because it gies them a chance to warn policemen of the violent potential of black anger from their viewpoint the program works because through it they can spread the word that brutality with impunity is no longer a policemans option these quiet results are exactly what sikes and welch want both express contempt for any other kind of success according to sikes we dont really want dramatic and visible results be cause they dont last they hare and wear off we want and expect quiet improvements in human relations and from the mayor we have not advertised failures or successes the theory is that by downplaying we let it happen before it can be noticed in another setting the remarks could be simjly those of men devoted to hard work without glory but in the context of houston they assume an additional meaningthat a loud voice might be answered by even louder ones and that the responding noises of hate might bring the programs potential crashing down around them houstons experiment is susceptible to varying interpretations it might be as sikes believes the sincere effort of a few powerful whites to set an example of racial reconciliation or it might be as the most disillusioned militants say a complete fraud aimed at image and at nothing more but the most provocative interpretation is of the program as a genuine effort under questionable sponsorship and questionable control this appraisal comes from carl moore perhaps a true revolutionary rather than an uiuiualified hater the chairman of souls unlimited moore who was involved in the tsu incident and was sulsequently expelled from the college has great respect for sikes and murray the project engineers but he regards them as pawms in a larger schema he recognizes the good will of some of houstons policemen yet these too he suggests may lose in the end houston in his view cannot yet support real multiracialism because the power is on the side of tradition and though the programs sponsorsthe financiers the mayor and his men the police chiefmay sincerely want to avoid violent racial confrontation they are not ready for the progress sikes and murray envision moores opinions approximate those of rev earl a allen director of hope inc according to allen the black community has no voice in determining how the police force operates the white man decides whether or not we will be called nigger when approached by police officers the white power structure decides who the police chief will be and what policies he will follow a police force over which the peojile have no ctintrol is there for their oppression and not for their protection when one has no power to control the police one does not live in a democracy one lives in a police state houstons experiment gives black people the illusion that they have some control ov er police affairs and suggests that they will have more but whether the appearance is real in imageconscious houston is another question and the answer to that question lies outside the policecommunity program outside the black communities and outside the police department the main thing is to project the image of i my country in the best possible way thats how ambassador rupiah b banda sums up his duties the yearold son of a corn and tobacco farmer heads the washington mission of zambia formerly northern rhodesia a copperrich former british colony that won its independence in under the leadership of president kenneth kaimda the image projected by zambia has been one of youth at the election victory of his united national independence party in january dr kaunda became the youngest prime minister in the british commonwealth his cabinet is one of the youngest in the world so it is only fitting that his representative in washington should be the youngest african ambassador in the us capital since the arrival of ambassador banda and his wife hope in washington months ago their comfortable residence has become a favorite gathering spot for some of the most exciting and outspoken members of the citys younger set it was one of the few places stokely carmichael and miriam makeba felt free to visit together during their courtship the ambassador does not consider his relative youth as a handicap but concedes that it has caused a few minor incidents occasionally you show up at a reception with an older person in the car or my chauffeur and they are mistaken to be the ambassador he explains but the twinkle in his eye proves that he has no hangups about his age and that he finds such incidents humorous rather than humiliating actually since diplomats are ranked according to length of stay not age ambassador banda has already acquired considerable seniority in washington where ambassadors are constantly coming and going l ike many other leaders from newly independent countries ambassador biuida rose to the top through hard work for the nationalist movement before independence after high school he remembers i went to the post office training school and became a morse code operator i lived in broker hill a

attend the university of addis ababa a year later he transferred to the university of lund sweden where he received his bachelors degree in economic history in he was his partys representative to scandinavia during his stay in sweden and helped prepare that part of the world for zambias independence the reward was not long in coming the last day of my examination at lund recalls the ambassador i received a letter from my president telling me that he knew that i was doing very well in school and intended to continue towards a masters degree but he thought that as one who had fought for my country i would accept tlie obligation of having to return home he suggested to me that he wanted me to be charge daffaires at the new embassy in moscow if everything went well i would become his

advancement of liberal causes in the washington metropolitan area and his extraordinarv devotion to the welfare of the citizens of the nations capital he is pctcv greene washingtons funniest most personable and probably most influential econict his autobiography reads in capsule form i was born in wasliington i went to dc schools spent the majority of my life in dc jails in more detail his early life is a primer on growing up in the ghetto petcy was one of seven children of an alcoholic mother who lived on welfare for years his father was sentenced to years at alcatraz for robbe ry when petey vvas just a kid it was a humiliating experience for the youngster but it taught him where his strength lay he reminisces what my father had done was in the paer and a friend of mine had cut it out as i walked down the corridor of the school i saw the children crowded around him he was reading the story when all the children saw me they started laughing i couldnt fight i couldnt beat him so the only defense i could put up to get the crowd on iny side was to say something to make them laugh so i made up some lies about his familythey were lies but they were comicaland i got the kids on my side since then i could alvvays use my wit and my rhyming and my talking to get the audience on my side he still can on stage he can talk about his own childhoods ixverty and crime in a way that makes bitter reality sound like funny fairytales petey was reared by his grandmotheractually a great aunt whom he loved dearly but her concern for him did not preent him from getting into trouble he was a problem for his teachers except for the year he made a bet that he could make the honor roll he didand dropped out of the lolh grade to join the anny he stayed in the ser ice for six years but was discharged as undesirable when it was discocred that he was a drug addict he had picked up the habit in japan years earlier he kicked the heroin habit by sheer will power after his grandmother found out about itfor the first time i saw my grandmother crybut instead he began to drink soon petev was a wino who wandered back and forth to jail for to day terms between pushing dope snatching purses and sticking up stores at the low point in his life he slept in trucks and back alleys telling jokes for the inevitable bottle of cheap wine but eight years ago petey decided to change the decision was based on several factors first he was sentenced to ten vears im prisonment for tinned robbery this was different from th rest and recuperation bit he had done earlierand the prospect of ten years at lorton reformatory near washington scared him then his grandmother died felt as if the roof had cav ed in on me says petey in the past even though i slept in trucks and liv ed the life of a bum i always had a door key and i could always go home and sometimes my grandmotlier would pay my fines now petey told himself better try to straighten up because when i get out this time i wont have anybody to fall back on the third factor in petevs reformation was the realization that he was an alcoholic at lorton petev started attending alcoholics anonymous meetings strictly because it would improv e his chances of being paroled but at one meeting petey discovered with a shock that his experiences were identical to those tlescribed by a visiting aa member his shakes and blackout spells were symptoms of acute alcoholism petey decided to change he recalls his reasoning i said well petey you aint getting no younger its best for you to go out there and see how it is liv ing on the other side you hav e been ev erything thats on the bad side of the coina dope addict a wino a con man a bum and a drunk youre going to try the other side it cannot be no worse petey began to take medication to curb his drinkinghe still does and started pulling strings to get out of lorton through a lucky break he got the chance to emcee a show for the inmates right after his arrival at lorton he was such a success that the vvardmi called him to his office the following day and asked do you mean to tell me that with the talent you have you go sticking up stores with your talent you dont even belong here petey had been told he was talented before but now for the first time he was thinking of how to use his skills and interests constructivelv because of his gift of gab his stay at lorton was not unpleasant at first he worked at the chaptl and helpid the chaplain arrange talent shows and an annual jazz festival on the side he coached sports teams and became lortons first disc jockey one saturday morning petey felt bored and told the assistant warden look man aint nothing for us to do on saturday morning why dont you let me go in that room wmth the record set and play records so the pefetj greene show got started and by the time petey was released there were tliree different deejays each with his own show at lorton but petey the easygoing dude wasnt as happy as he seemed i was laughing on the outside but i worried the whole time i was in the penitentiary he recalls although he was promoted to principal of the academic school he made no attempt to finish his own education knowing what an excon would have to face when he came out i wouldnt take the high school equivalency test he says i knew that i couldnt get no decent job petey greene got a couple of breaks however first he was paroled after only five yeius in the pen mainly because he had saved the life of another inmate by talking him out of jumping from a water tower then he got a job wnth the concentrated employment program of washingtons united planning organization upo wanted to hire exconvictsbecause james banks its director at the time felt that if you want to eliminate itoverty youve got to include persons with arrest and convictions records and the excons know the community better than anybody else petey was one of the first neigliborhood workers they employed when he was released in august the changeover was not easy the job paid not much compared to what some of his hustling friends were making but petey told himself this is it i aint got to go back to the pentcntiary i have been asking people for breaks all my life and now ive got a pretty decent old job at im single so i think i can handle this before he left lor ton peteys biggest problem had been the prospect of getting up on time every morning that proved to be a minor worry other aspects of his new way of living were harder to cope with policemen laughed at his announced intention to play it straight and tried to provoke him he felt ostracized by his fllov workers i wanted to go out to parlies they were giving but i just couldnt bring myself around to being where i was not wanted he says so i started going home just watching my telev ision reading books and so on but this became a bore and i decided to go back to my old haunts like th and t where the narcotics traffic and anned rolbory traffic are because i knew i would be accepted there the temptation was strong but petey overcame it instead he analyzed his situation if he felt this vvay other excons might have similar problems why didnt they get together he approached the rev griffin s smith an excon w ho finished a year term for armed robbery in and who now was a neighborhood worker for the urban league rev smith liked the idea of a club tor excons and so efec efforts from exconvicts was launched in the early part of efec now has about members about onethird of whom are actively involved in the organization they meet once a week to let off steam and discuss mutual and individual problems efec is a nonprofit organization open to all excons who have demonstrated their willingness to participate in selfhelp programs it has worked primarily to improve employment opportunities for persons with police records and after some initial resistance and suspicion from authorities and dudes alike it is now an accepted institution in the community the second anniversary celebration was actually held inside irlon reformatory to the delight of the inmates and the constemation of the guards many of whom could have sworn that petey and the others were not coming back to lorton voluntarily petey also helped launch bonabond a bonding jtrogram for excons seeking employment and he is involved in all sorts of other projects that may help the community in general and excons in particular he has advanced to job coach supervisor at wcep and many of the job coachesthey serve as gobetweens for persons who find jobs through the upo and their employersare excons and members of efec since july he cohosts a halfhour employment information program on washingtons educational television channel four nights a week he attends meetings of all kinds and he makes appearances as a comedian and emcee but he still finds time to visit his old drinking friends once in a while he does not try to convert them pctcy does not force his ideas on anybody i ncer lecture them he says if they dont want to square petey dont make them square im no moses i cannot lead them out of nothing i can only say well jack this is a good living the way im living nowthe straight way now he is concerned about the younger generation however and will go out of his way to tell school chililrcn to stay in school and stay away from crime efec is trying to establish a regular lecturing schedule with the public schools to spread this vital message through excons for petcy it s not enough to just make it yourself he finds it amazing and wonderful that he now gets paid for the same jokes he used to tell for a bottle of wine ten years ago and he admits that not all excons can rap like me but he insists that tlicre is a tremendous change and i know that what happened to me can happen to another excon only one thing makes him sad the fact that his grandmother did not live to see his transformation she always wanted me to be somebody he says now petey greene is somebody and one who has lived to see it is his mother mrs jackie greene she has even been inspired to change her own way of living when petey got out of jail mrs greene was still living on welfare but petey got her a job as a welfare aide with the urban league she is still working she has quit drinkingjust like her sonand she and petey are equally proud of each other petey has a quick mind he can think but nobody thought hed do anything but go back to the same old thing says mrs greene but i know hetl make it im just so proud of him i get calls from people who tell me we had forgotten petey was your son but he is doing wonderful things for this community petey s parole officer adam scott jr says the same thing petcy is on parole until but scott says that he is thinking of requesting that the parole board place petey under inactive supervisiona form of parole reserved for excons who are doing very well me is a force in the community and can relate to the people there scott says petey would welcome the change since he finds it a nuisance to hae to clear oiitoftown trips two weeks in advance have his girlfriends approved and his financial affairs supenised but he does not worry about it he has proed he can make it i magine a cat calling broadway filthy and nasty thats what wilson pickett did in the lyrics of a song called funkij broaihcaij a number that moved folks across the country to do a dance of the same name hes the one who promised to hold the girls and tease them and do all the things that please them thats what went down in a song by the name of in the milnifiht hour a real moving groover that sold more than a million records for which pickett recei ed a gold disc at a concert in jersey citys rooseelt field last august in the middle of his hit midnifht mover the singer paused guitars pierced the calm summer night with that ribsandtips twang as pickett stepped from the stage and moved closer to the youthful congregation you know somebody asked me they say pickett what is a midnight moxer twang twang i say a midnight mover is a mo er that mo es at midnight the man they call the wicked pickett had put it to them straight what else could a midnight inoer beand thats the kind of action the young pople dig they screamed and stomped and urged him on with outbursts of tell it like it be and work out baby pickett was just getting warm can i get a little lady to come out here and move with me on first base tonight a game sister jumped from the stands got on in the music with him and indeed they did move on first base that night and the guitars and the trumpets and the saxophones and the drums and the witnesses praised the celebration somebody keep walking up to me continued pickett and they keep asking me they say pickett want you to tell me what soul is and i told him soul aint nothin but a feeling and he say how do you know when you get the feeling and i told him it gets in your hand and makes you move your hand sometime pickett started waving his hand to the rhythm and i told him sometimes it gets in vour feet and it makes vou nionc your feet and his feet got into the action with some of those terrible skipslidcstoinpslide changes and i told him sometimes it gets you around here pickett held his hips and it makes you you know it makes you i mean it just makes you mooooove all this and right about then he started moving his body the way one moves ones body when ones body is really free to stretch on out and move the wailing saxophones and the screams of the crowd punctuated the nottobedenied quality of erotica at the peak of which pickett came back strong with that shrilling baritoneanti when all was finally silent the question that frequently has been asked of late lingered what is soul soul begets some ratlier strimge definitions in academic america but with wilson pickett its more a ease of demonstration than definition hes too suggestive complained one young woman but the masses of young people seem to agree more with the sister who sighed pickett just makes you want to let it all hang out thus the debate over soul when it gets past the superficial has something to do with the ages old argument over what to do with the human eoinsave it or spend it those who are tuned in to the letitallhangout spirit are saying later for the saers and wilson pickett is one of their baddest rappers like one girl shouted from the stands that night in roosevelt field soul aint nothin hut people trying to live and the faithful are convinced that anything else is something other than soulin soulin started for wilson pickett in prattville ala where as he puts it man used to pick up some cotton by the time he reached his teens pickett was sick of both picking cotton and the ways of white folks that was in the early s about the time that ijttle willie john was socking fever to the brothers and sisters lloyd price was into a strong black thing with lawdy miss clawdy and an imitator named elvis was wiggling his way to a million bucks nobody around prattville could have suspected then that the little cat in the cotton field would mature into one of the black giants who would rescue rhythm and blues from the rock n roll merchants but neither did they know tliat he was whipping the game by putting rocks in the cotton sacks sitting in the back of his limousine legs crossed speeding f the connecticut turnpike to a cool gig and a cool five grand he laughs as he recalls those plantation years man theres all kinds of ways to trick whitey pickett continues i used to bring in a sack of cotton and while whitey was on one side of the truck weighing it id go around to the other side of the truck when hed throw the sack on the truck my partner the cat in the truck stacking the cotton sacks would just hand the sack down to me id go out in the field and mess around long enough to make it look good and then bring the same sack of cotton back and get it weighed again that not unlike the tales about the masters soup being poisoned and his bam being set afire was sontaken where its found when i was growing up down south says pickett the young ieople didnt have that respect for whitey that a lot of the old folks used to have pickett remembers that nothing turned him off anymore than the white folks custom of walking into the homes of black people without even knocking at the door one day it became more than he could hear silently i asked this white cat why dont you knock dont you know how to knock on a door pickett got away with badmouthing whitcy the mark of a had nigger down there in the big foot country hut not long after that occasion his mother sent him to detroit to live with his father he was sitting on his porch one day in strumming his guitar and singing the gospel music he had come to love as a boy when willie schofield of th falcons a rhythm and blues group happened by picketts sound caught schofields car he told mo man you got a good voice and invited me to come to their next rehearsal thats when found out i could sing rhythm and blues before the year was out the falcons recorded i found a love a tune written by pickett and schofield that climbed high on the charts and showcased picketts talent as a lead singer not only did pickett grow as a performer while singing with the falcons but perhaps more important he learned how to handle himself in the vicious bchiiidthcsccncs entertainment world more than a few large talents hae gone the way of obscurity or suffered at the hands of the middlemen managers promoters agents etc because they were poor businessmen with that uppermost in mind pickett made his mo e as a single in since hitting it big in with in the midniiit hour he has stayed near the top of a field where names anish like soap left under running water authoritative voices in the rb world have called pickett second to james brownthe cat they all pay homage to we all learn a lot from him says pickettand anybody who makes a habit of turning the radio dial ov er to the far right where its at everywhere has heard these wilson pickett hits land of kxx dances ninetynine and a half wont do mustang sally vm in love a change of pace song for pickett that he croons beautifully and tlie millionseller his gold discs and other awards decorate the walls of his office in the modest suite he shares with his manager jimmy evans the door reads wilson pickett enterprises inc which is the way its done on west th street in manhattan where the rent is as imposing as the edifices and the elevators are filled with lookalike showgirls waiting to be discovered enterprises is however no mere symbol twentysevenyearold pickett says that by the time hes hes going to quit performing and concentrate on management already hes shaping the careers of two singers who are in the wilson pickett show danny white and alder ray miss ray is an explosive young singer who shows her stuff on songs made famous by aretha and etta and pickett is making arrangements for her to cut some original material white who came to new york from his native panama seven years ago is serving what might be called an rb apprenticeship under pickett ordinarily the pickett aggregation does about four onenighters a week he used to do more but found himself giving too much to uncle sam staying on the east coast as much as possible a couple or few times a year they go on tour about days at a time pickett likes doing onenighters and when asked if he ever gets tired of all the travel he answers no quick too quick so after being pressed with the question he admits well i guess i get a little tired sometimes and after a slight pause the nottobedefeated pickett adds but cats who work in factories get tired too iia ing the last word is in keeping w ith the pickett style he was probably a star off stage long before he became a star on stagethe kind of guy who in tlie typical black community is known as a tough cat which usually refers of course to one who has a way with his clothes a way with his fists a way with the sisters and most surely a er long rap pickett looks good in his rags and his rap is quite togetherand its a good bet that hes probably stolen a girl or two in his day and punched somebody out there is a sense that pickett is the embodiment of that peculiar aggressiveness one has seen in black boys who ended up in the mans jail before reaching manhood and the further sense that he is the ideal expression of how all that energy if not harnessed can blow this world wilson pickett as richard pryor once said about fellow comedian bill cosby is one who got away picketts style also includes a large quantity of shuckin and jivin but behind all that there breathes an unusually serious young man hes a perfectionist says george patterson leader of the midnight movers band featured in the pickett show always one notices picketts attention to detail quibbling over the w ording on the side of the bus he rents obser ing the extraordinary quality of the tenor player in the band noticing the stiffness in one of the newer members of the group as the band goes into a dance routine or checking the sound system again and again and again in a club where the sound equipment was especially bad pickett asked the manager hows your p system its not what youre used to but you just get up there and open jour mouth and itll tear them apart answered the manager but i want the people to hear said pickett contemptuously like virtually everone who goes before the public pickett frets over his personal appearance and lately hes been concerned about the matter of fans not recognizing him with his natural hair he only started wearing an afro a few months ago and confides man the time i spent under the dryer and the money spent keeping my do togetherim glad to be rid of all that aggravation natural for pickett applies to his music as well as his hair i hate gimmicks in songs he says and in person his numbers do not as in the case of the gimmick vocalists sound radically different from the recordings he describes his musical style as a gospel melody not nothing pretty a funky groove with lines that mean something wilson pickett has been good for rhythm and blues saying it the other wav around doesnt reallv make sense and now hes tliinking about selling his rosedale long island house and building a bigger one in great neck he owns a boat a diamond ring thats another something expensive fishing rods various other gadgets and hes even thinking about buying a rolls royee and he svvears that lie s saving money all that may sound like mainstream but wilson pickett wealthy or not will probably always be into something ctmsiderably stronger than that dubious waterway cheek him out there is an enormous power in who he is and what he does and the way in which young people respond to it rhythm and blues as brother leroi jones pointed out in black music takes one to a place where black people live and where black people move in almost absolute openness and strength pickett came a long way from that cotton field but he brought his tricks with him and as sweet irony would have it a white dude nicknamed him wicked m oscow ark hius residents stradclle highway miles southeast of pine bluff and miles west of clarksdale miss it does not look like much unheralded by roaclsigns marked only by a weary filling station and a few rectangularly leveed ponds it is just some more flat land in the insectridden wetness of the lower mississippi valley nd marion ark miles to the north on the banks of the mississippi opposite memphis does little better although marked by a large chamber of commerce billboard its population is only soo and it has been bonedry all summer but both towns have more than monotony they hae catfish the souths newest crop one that promises to diversify the yield of big farmers and may be the sole hope of the small acreage farmer wdio lacking volume needs a highselling product moscow is the site of arkansas latest catfish experiment a acre fish farm with breeding ponds and the states only operating catfish processing plant it is an allblack venture financed by the small business administration and sponsored by the moscow development corporation and in marion is one of the states original fish farmers john gammon jr who in the s set aside of his x wellfarmed acres for fish breeding and who now plans to increase his fish acreage to acres upping his catfish production to about pounds annually and raising his potential fishfarming gross to about the new crops vitality is bespoken by the ease with which both moscow and marion catfish are marketed a distributor has contracted for all of the moscow famis output anil gammon savs he has never had trouble getting rid of his yield furthennore farmers from both towms report catfish is one of the souths most profitable crops returning more per acre than cotton f ish farming as an industry is scarcely five years old and is peculiar to the mississippi river areas of missouri tennessee mississippi and arkansas before i only a few hundred acres in the vallev were devoted to such famiinjj and the scattered ponds were then stocked primarily for sport fishing but as the decade got under way it was discovered tliat catfish could bring a handsome profitsometimes more per farm acre than the regions staples cotton soybeans and rice by catfish acreage rose to in both mississippi and arkansas the leading producers and by to in mississippi and in arkansas however despite the million which mississippi vdley catfish are expected to return in the lingering primitiveness of the industry has created three obstacles for those who wish to specialize in fish the high capitalization recpiired to convert farm land has stifled the ambitions of many wouldbe fish farmers the nuisance and cost of frequent fast transport has limited the geographical range of business for farmers who deal only in fish freshfromthepond and the lack of mechanization has created high labor costs that have forced catfish prices to cents per pound scaring away many prospective buyers by breathing life into the evans sons processing and marketing co the moscow development corp has licked all three problems sk sba loan made possible by the corporation o ercame the first two paying for pond exca ation and construction of a packing and freezing plant ev ans and sons itself took a major step toward eliminating the third by patenting an automatic fish feeding gadget the black fish farmers of moscow have both the states sole working freezer plant and the mississippi valleys original catfish pellet blower the problems of freshfromthepond catfish farming have not however hurt large acreage fanners like john gammon who in addition to fish raises wheat cattle cotton strawberries rice alfalfa soybeans and melons able to draw from the profits of other crops he dug his four ponds without difficulty and being near memphis one of the souths large metropolitan areas he can sell to urban and suburban restaurants without transportation problems in addition to his memphis and west memphis restaurant sales gammon does business on his own land with sports fishermen allowing them to dip their hooks in his ponds and charging them per pound of catch he also sells to local nonfishermen and occasionally holds fish fries gammon whose father overcame wild cane fields and razorback hogs to establish the farm a hall century ago has always been a fisherman his involvement in largescale catfishing began humbly enough in with fish fries for friends the fish fries he explains began to attract great numbers in the s and prompted him to produce his own fish rather than draw them from the nearby mississippi or farm ponds of other planters within the past ten years gammons hobby fishing has become a business and being one of the valleys most experienced fish farmers he recently coauthored an article in the us yearbook of agriculture urging other farmers to diversify into catfish as a member of arkansass threeman agricultural stabilization and conservation committee he is intimately involved with diversifying the states farm production away from the economically frail crops of the traditional south particularly cotton gammon says that when he began raising fish it wasnt something youd borrow money to start now he says he knows an arkansas farmer who is excavating a acre catfish farm even though he insists northeast arkansas has some of the best soil in the delta gammon will give up more growing acres to dig fish ponds because catfish is one of tlie best crops you can have a rkansass fish farming pioneers faced recurring failures during the s the first fish to be farmed in the state were buffalo which brought little clientele and no profits according to dr earl e evans of evans sons buffalo were not a delicacy in the south and were not as tasty as catfish furthermore he explains the early fish farming efforts were uneducated and poor planning lead experimenters to destroy rather than enhance their land many were literally washed out by overflooding he reports the increasing demand for catfish and the interested guidance of state and federal agricultural authorities has reversed the prospect with ever larger production in mind the moscow fish farmers have geared their operation to their processing plant rather than to their breeding ponds the plant was constructed with a capacity far exceeding that of the ponds it will not fully realize its potential until other farmers in the area decide to raise fish and channel them through the plant on the way to the market although it bears the name evans c sons and furnishes value to dr evans land the moscow fish farm is very much a community venture all but four of the persons involved in the daily operation of the plant are residents of moscow a community that is twothirds negro most of the men in the plant are young and enthusiastic edward collins the manager is college trained in biology and left a teaching job in albion mich to take over the catfish venture in his native moscow of the exxderiment in fish farming he comments sure it will work i wouldnt be here if it wouldnt albert stuckey another of the young men is more insistent it took around to start he says it better work according to dr evans the prospect of success is considerable because a newly formed marketing group inland fish inc with outlets in oklahoma texas and illinois as well as the lower mississipjji valley states has agreed to buy all of the fish evans sons can grow and process and success might bring control of the business squarely into the hands of local farmers i have thought it might be wise to incorporate dr evans says and include other farmers in the area both black and white if the business grows the economic significance of the moscow experiment is not lost on the founders of the farm j c hamilton development corp president notes the farm is a progressive thing in this community and if fish farming continues to grow like it is it will be taking over cotton farming before long nor is the importance lost on other mississippi valley farmers during the plants dedication ceremonies the license plates of cars parked in the lot told their own story mississippi tennessee and texas cars were liberally distributed among those of arkansas according to ed collins this is really a unique operation people are coming up here constantly to see whats happening t iikue are eight memorable lines in the confessions of william styron these lines whieh are worthy of a better setting illuminate a scene of great power and perception nat turner his deed done is sitting in a prison cell regarding thomas gray a treacherous and unctuously condescending white man who is trying to worm his way into the black psyche lor purposes of white aggrandizement nat regards this specimen with distaste and repulsion he knows why gray is there he knows that gray is working with the enemy and he begins to wonder about the experiences which produce such men of a sudden styron writes nat has an impression dim and lleeting of hallucination of talk buried deep in dreams he stares long and hard at gray and perceives that he is little dillerent from any of the others adding nonetheless it was a matter of wonder to me where this my last white man save one with the rope had come from now as many times before i had the feeling i had made him up it was impossible to talk to an invention therefore i remained all the more determinedly silent nat turner speaks these lines on page and then disappears from william styron s confessions having warnctl ihe reader that he continues at his own risk what is truly remarkable is that william styron could write these lines without realizing that he was judging himself as well as thomas gray for styron has in fact replaced thomas gray the author of the first confessions as nat turners last white man and the confessions of william styron proves that it is still impossible to talk to white inventions except for the lines indicated and a few random piotes from the original confessions nat turner docs not speak in william styrons confessions the voice in this confession is the voice of william styron the images are the images of william styron the confession is the confession of william stv ron and styrons confessions despite the revealing hosannas of the white culture structure is a recxrd of the hallucinatory silence of our history of years of talk buried deep in dreams styron dreams but he refuses to confront history and that refusal defines his book which tells us little about the historical nat turner and a great deal about william styron and the white culture structure which made the book a modern literarv happening styron tells us he is meditating on history but we are not fooled we know that he is really trying to escape history we knowhe confesses itthat he is trying to escape the judgment of history embodied in nat turner and his spiritual sons of the twentieth century styron begins his flight from nat turnerand historyby substituting a white panoily of fantasies for the historical girders of the nat turner cataclysm instead of following the traditional technique of the historical novelist who works within the tension of accepted facts styron forces history to move within the narrow grooves of his preconceived ideas particidarly interesting is the use styron makes of the basic historical document the confessions of nat turner which was edited and published in by thomas r gray a white lawyer hostile to nat turner and the cause he represented gray interviewed nat tunier after the insurrection and published the socalled confession to demonstrate the policy of our laws in restraint of tb ss of our population and to induce all those entrusted with ih tion as well as our citizens generally to see that they are rigidly enforced some lines in the gray confessions spurious nat turner probably did not say that we found no more victims to gratify our thirst for blood it is also probable that gray suppressed some facts and gave undue emphasis to others but for all its limitations the gray confessions remains the primary document and it contains lines which are obviously genuine particularly the passages in which turner describes his visions gray was hardly up to inventions of that order it should also be noted that nat turner was served better in many instances by thomas gray the avowed racist than by william styron the avowed liberal in addition to the gray document there is a rich tradition surrounding the event and some references in contemporary newspapers according to the historical data the real nat turner was a virile way that styron is using nat turner as a counter in two desperate and rather pathetic private games in the first game styron is writing for his very life throwing up smokescreen after smokescreen to hide himself from the truth of the american experience on this level it is the thrust of his art to reconcile nat turner to an unacceptable reality by making him confess that he would have spared at least one white person go ye into the city and find one just one in this desperate game styron uses the white woman as bait tempting his central character with page after page of sexual fantasy by this method styron shifts the focus of the turner irisuirection downgrading the main issues white oppression and black liberation and elevating the white woman to a position of central importance the childwoman margaret who was a victim of history becomes the central image by which styron rejects commanding courageous figure styron rejects history by rejecting this image of nat turner in fact he wages literary war on this image substituting an impotent cowardly irresoluie creature of his own imagination for the real black man who killed or ordered killed real white people for real historical reasons the man styron substitutes for nat turner is not only the antithesis of nat turner he is the antithesis of blackness in fact he is a standard styron type a neurasthenic hamletlike white intellectual in blackface we are not quibbling here over footnotes in scholarly journals we are objecting to something more insidious more dangerous we are objecting to a deliberate attempt to steal the meaning of a mans life and that attempt must be condemned in the name of the man wdiose name has been illicitly appropriated for a dubious literary adventure one wonders really why william styron entitled his book the confessions of nat turner instead of the confessions of samuel washington or the confessions of william styron for it is obvious on the face of it that styron has little interest in deepening our underloading of nat turner on the contrary it seems to this reader anyhistory it is she who turns styrons nat from hatred of his owm people to a missionary effort of uplift it is she who brings styron s nat to partial repentance it is she whom styrons nat visions as he mounts the gallows never before it seems to me has the white woman been used with such cynicism and desperation on another level styron is playing the new history game of reviving big black sambo in other words he is trying to prove that u b phillips the classic apologist for slavery and stanley elkins the sophisticated modem apologist were right when they projected sambothe bootlicking headscratching childmanas a dominant plantation type the suggestion here is that the afroamerican slave went beyond the call of the whip in accommodating himself to slavery that slavery as styron says dehumanized the slave and divested him of honor moral responsibility and manhood and that the character not characterization of sambo did in fact exist styron knows that sambo existed what he does not knowbecause he does not know himselfis that antebellum southerners and their modem descendants had to believe that sambo existed in order to deal with the contradictions of their own existence styron proves this inad ertently for we catch him redhanded manipulating evidence in order to make nat turner and his aides the very antithesis of the sambo mythconfirmers of the elkinsphillipsstyron dream in fact styron is so determined to prove that his dream exists that he gives his main character the mind and vocabulary of u b phillips and he performs the amazing feat of actually putting the sambo thesis in nat turners mouth on pages and styrons nat is filled with rage by the harmless dull malleable docility of hark and he discourses in the best new history mode on the unspeakable bootlicking sambo all giggles and smirks and oily sniveling servility styron accomplishes this literary sleight of hand by suppressing facts and inventing facts since he has already admitted that he departed from cutanddried facts i will only say here that there is a pattern in his distortion of the facts and that tlie iattern is meaningful first of all and most important of all there is a pattern of emasculation which mirrors americas ancient and manic pattern there is a second pattern which again mirrors the white mans praxis a pattern of destructuring the black family and the black group and these patterns contribute to an overall pattern of destruction in which the historical nat turner is deracinated and made impotent and irrelevant consider for example styrons assault onnat turners family nat turner tells us in the gray confessions that he grew up in a strong family unit which buttressed his sense of identity and mission he speaks with fondness of his father and mother who taught him to read and write he also remembers his grandmother who was he says very religious and to whom was much attached william styron disapproves of the historical arrangements of the turner family he knows the turner family in other words he has an idea of the black family which contradicts nat turners reality and he begins his book by making nat turners reality conform to his idea nats beloved grandmother is immediately banished i never laid eyes on my grandmother styrons nat says nat is also denied the support of his father who fled to the north after instilling a burning sense of mission in his son in crays confessions nat says that when he was three or four he was told that he surely would be a prophet adding and my father and mother strengthened me in this my first impression saying in my presence i was intended for some great purpose emphasis added that same line appears in styrons confessions in a remarkably revealing translation styrons nat says and my mother strengthened me in this my first impression emphasis added styron has eliminated tlie troublesome black father having created a proper adc slave family styron works his white magic on turners mother according to tradition nats mother was an african native who hated slavery so much that she was determined not to add to the slave population at nats birth she was so enraged that she had to be tied to keep her from murdering nat this passion for freedom was unfortunate from styrons viewpoint for he wanted nat to be a house nigger and the son of a house nigger he therefore pushed this incident back a generation in his book nats grandmother is enraged at the birth of nats mother by this alchemy styron detaches mother and son from black people and mother and son become burlesques of the traditional house nigger types nats mother for example is always reminding nat of his special place in the plantation pecking order us folks in de houseshe says is qualityr styron forces this viewpoint his viewpoint on his central character who feels toward his old marsa a feeling one should bear only toward the divinity a pet the little black jewel of turners mill he is taught to read in sttons fantasy not by his father and mother but by the good white folks styron pursues his fantasy by filling his main character with immense loathing for black people the man erroneously and libelously identified as nat turner begins more and more to regard the negroes of the mill and field as creatures beneatli contempt as a lower order of people a ragtag mob coarse raucous clownish uncouth he identifies black people with animals and he is made to say by styron that my black eating people were surely like flies gods mindless outcasts lacking even tliat will to destroy by their own hands their unending anguish relentlessly remorselessly styron pursues his cardboard nat turner stuffing his mind with u b phillips platitudes styrons nat sees himself in the mirror eyes rolling white with nervous vigilance he sees a black man in the distance groping in vain for the source of some intolerable itch he sees black people in church mouths agape or with sloppy uncomprehending smiles shuffling their feet suddenly they seem to me as meaningless and as stupid as a bam full of mules and i hate them one and all he observes a group of slaves who have been sold south and he is haunted and perplexed by the docile equanimity and good cheer with which these simple black people irrevocably uprooted would set out to encounter a strange and unknown destiny the poor dumb creatures didnt seem to care parting from a place which had been their entire universe for years causerl them no more regret than did the future cast over them worry or foreboding they were children hopeless children twittering and giggling they were styrons nat thinks like animals and they deserved to be sold as for freedom styrons nat has doubts about it mouthing the classic apology of antebellum southerners the character bearing the name of one of the most passionate rebels in american history says it is useless to free such creatures for what he asks could freedom mean to arnold is this the voice of nat tiinier of course not william styron is playing he is trmng to hide the real nat turner the real nat turner was one with his destiny he was one with his people he recalls in the orginal confessions that he grew up among them and that such was the confidence of the negroes in the neighborhood even at this tarly period of my life in my superior judgment that they would often carry me with them when they were going on any roguer to plan for them this nat turner is displaced in the hook hy the white man in blackface who settles down into the silent ceaselessly vigilant racking solitude styron has prepared for him what is this if not a project of destruction involving the vitals of the historical personage named nat turner styron carries this project to its ultimate end hy emasculating nat turner in the process he ignores evidence which indicates that nat had a slave wife according to thomas wentworth lligginson contemporary newspaper reports said nats wife was tortured under the lash after her hiishands execution to make her produce his papers migginsons report is supported hy the oral tradition w s drewry reports that nats son redic survived him but this e idence clashes with styrons purjoses so he consummates the white fantasy hy defusing nat sexually in styrons fantasy nat turner hecxmes an imiwtent sexcrazed celibate who masturbates every saturday in the carpenters shop and it is always a nameless white girl a young girl with golden curls who triggers his fantasies styron also pro ides his character with a homosexual encounter and a detailed white fantasy life from first to last the white man masquerading as nat turner is slavering over some childish southern belle there is miss emmeline with her lustrous rich auburn hair and her fair and slender fingers there is the fiancee of major ridley with her soft white thighs and a neck as white as a water lily there is above all else margaret whitehead with her fine white skin milky transpartiit and her hands white as milk glass blueveined not only that styrons character is so attuned to whiteness that a white voice turns him on languishing in prison he hears the voice of a young girl singing sweet and gentle from some white delicate throat condemned hy silence and by emphasis is black flesh styrons character has onlv one fantasv of a black woman and she is you guessed ita prostitute but the black woman fails to excite him and he fastens in his mind on a young white woman now obviously someone has an enormous whitewoman problem but since there is not one shred of evidence to indicate that nat turner was obsessed by the traditional obsession of the white male we can only wonder why william stron dreams of black revolutionaries dreaming of white women nat turner tells us in the original confessions that he was obsessed by black liberation and he tells us that he spent most of his life preparing for his great mission styron does not introduce us to that black revolutionary inexplicably he omits the fact that nat ran away from his master and he refuses to confront the man who talked to god and w ho heard god order the destruction of the enemies of god and man that man i say is not in william styrons book also absent is the man who refused to plead guilty at his trial saying to his counsel that he did not feel so it should also be said that william stvron shows no understanding of the psychology which makes slaves rise up and cut their oppressors throats from ear to ear stvton evades this dynamic he refikses to come to grips with the institutionalized violence of an oppressive status quo and the inevitable counter violence of the oppressed instead of dealing seriously with these questions styron continues his game of evasion by inv enting a jwvver struggle between nat and will and by weighing nat down with white complexes nat in styrons fantasy fears and loathes his aide will who is described as a mad animal a wild boar hog according to styron will forces his way into the rebellion this contradicts the facts as established by the gray confessions in that document nat says he arrived at the rendezvous spot and found two new recruits will and jack i salute them on coming up he says and asked will how came he there he answered his life was worth no more than others and his liberty as dear to him i asked him if he thought to obtain it he said he would or lose his life that was enough to put him in full confidence in his determination to reduce liberty to personal passions and history to sex styron ignores this evidence and questions nat turners credentials as a leader at the moment of truth nat is presented as a panicky fearful impotent man retching in the bushes at the sight of blood nearly tom apart by frights and apprehensions he is unable to strike a death blow and he condemns his woinanish failure to strike down white flesh styrons fantasy also contradicts the psychology of the black rebel who told a racist in virginia in i placed fifteen or twenty of the best armed and most to be relied on in front who generally approached the houses as fast as their horses could run this was for two purposes to prevent their escape and strike terror to the inhabitantson this account i never got to the houses after leaving mrs whiteheads until the murders were committed exccpt in one case i sometimes got in sight in time to see the work of death completed viewed the mangled bodies as they lay in silent satisfaction and immediately started in quest of other victims emphasis added as for styrons central thesis that nat showed irresolution because he only killed margaret whitehead one can only say that tills is a manifestation of his refusal to understand general nat as he is sometimes called was the leader of the southampton insurrection and generals seldom kill it was nats duty to organize command and lead if styron finds this incomprehensible the explanation is to be sought not in nat turners inability to kill but in styrons inability to understand a black man leading after all styron makes thomas gray say to nat it aint as if you had been disinvolved in these proceedingsa field general runnin the whole show from way behind the lines in fact as grays confessions makes clear nat was a field general who divided his forces and coordinated them by this time he says in the gray confessions the six who had gone by mr bryants rejoined us and informed me they had done the work of death assigned them we again divided jrart going to mr richard porters and from thence to nathaniel francis the others to mr howell harris and mr t doyles on my reaching mr porters he had escaped with his family i understood there that the alarm had already spread and i immediately returned to bring up those sent to mr doyles and mr howell harris the party i left going on to mr francis having told them i would join them in that neighiorhood i immediately pursued the course taken by the party gone on before i pursued on their tracks to capt newit harris wlicre i found the greater jtart mounted and ready to start the men now amounting to about forty shouted and hurraed as rode up emphasis added this is i submit the picture of a field commander and it was this field commander who initiated the rebellion by striking his master with a hatchet because of the dark nat says t could not give a death blow the hatchet glanced from his head i stvron savs nat missed iw half a foot and will laid him dead after this incident nat directed the rebellion with a light cctemonial sword appropriate to his rank he struck sral blows with this sword but did not kill anyone he says as tlie sword was dull nats one confirmed kill corroborates this assertion after repeated blows with the dull sword he finally picked up a fence rail and dispatched margaret whitehead it is curious that styron the white liberal refuses to accept an explanation which was readily accepted by thomas gray who saw nat and wlio descrilhd the sword as a light one the same thing can he said of stvron s theorv that it was the niggers that heat nat thomas gray who would have seized on e idence of this nature did not report massive slave resistance to turners foray nor did contemporary newspaper accounts wliich said according to howlson that nat was defeated by the real heroism of the whites oldivioiis to this evidence styron pursues nat into his prison cell and dpries him of the meaning of his mission tlie caged nat according to styron was remorseful contrite filled with a terrible emptiness he couldnt pray he couldnt talk to gotl he was alone and forsaken tliomas gray who visited nat in prison contradicts styrons fantasy gray tells ns that nat was calm and cool to the end do you not find yourself mistaken now gray asked nat was not lirist crucified nat answered gray was impressed the calm deliberate composure with which he spoke of his late deeds and intentions the expression of his fiendlike face when excited by enthusiasm still bearing the stains of the blood of helpless innoetnce about him clothed with rags and covered witli chains yet daring to raise his manacled hands to heaven with a spirit soaring above the attributes of man i looked on him and my blood curdled in my veins in the pages of william sty rons confessions there is not one single image to compare with grays image of the defiant black rebel raising his manacled hands to heaven tlie difference in tone between the confessions of gray the racist and styron the white liberal gives one pause gray who loathed nat but who looked into his eyes gives him to history unrepentant coiirageoiis sure of his act and his cventnal vindication styron who says he syinpathizes with nat destroys liim as a man and as a leader and the terrifying implication of this fact is that the fascinationhorror of a bigot may he more compelling than the fascinationanxiety of a white liberal beyond all tliat tlie two confessions demonstrate how white americans use black americans no matter what we do whtn we refrain from cutting throats they stigmatize us as bootlicking sambos and when we cut throats they make us a bookofthemonthcluh selection and give us white dreams and the vocabulary of u b phillips its heads i win and tails vou lose thats the name of william styrons game and one comes at tlie end to the depressing conclusion that styrons confessions is the worst thing that has happened to nat turner since nats last white man save one with the pen broke his neck with a rope on a gallows in a virginia town called jerusalem the prophet who died in the jerusalem of america cool and calm sure of the black resurrection still awaits a literary inter preter worthy of his sacrifice he still awaits an interpreter who will not deal himself out of the game an inteipreter who is prepared to give something and to give up something an interpreter wlio recognizes that the rope has two ends and that you have to bring a man to find a man c rawling around the floor of his green bay wis apartment massive pro footballer willie davis peeks under a sofa in his crouched stance he thumbs through sev eral magazines digs his fingers into tlie sofas crevices sniffs around in a nearby closet then in the kitchen he is hunting frantically for the sliver of metal that joins his broken wristband to his watch has his threeyearold daughter lori been playing with the missing part and lost it has it slid down his pant leg and ended up quietly in liis shoe is it buried in the nearby jar of v itamin tablets davis explores all the possibilities as he meticulously retraces his sofakitchenjar search route absentmindedly ignoring his wifes sympathetic pleas to abandon the hunt now he is in the closet a third time patting the overhead shelf probing the corners picking pockets and finallyeureka i found it the star packer lineman grins his upper lip uneovering the five replacements for teeth knocked out in the football w ars his successful minnte search has revealed in its way some of the tenacity that powered him through pro football seasons four of the last five as an allnfl defensive end and four years completing a masters degree in business administration at the university of chicago his gridiron heroics had earned him the byron whizer white award as the national football league player who best serv ed his team community and nation in his academic prowess had brought him job oflers from major coqoorations and the conviction that business had sought him more as a student than as a football player before his graduation in june davis had duly noted the merger of football and business in one person in a scholarly monograph titled a job analysis of the performance of defensive end willie davis but now his mind dwells on the broken watch which had always been too small for a wrist that seems stouter than the steering column on the car he is driving he is going to have a downtown jeweler add two links s he walks toward the jewelry shop a block from his parked car passersby hail him with shouts of recognition or knowing smiles but when he finally enters the shop he is greeted by a nice little old white lady wanting to know in all seriousness which willie are you willie mays it is a question that never would be raised either by pro football fans or davis former professors which willie is he the scarred pound ironman who has played in consecutive league games and shares this feat of physical endurance only with washingtons bobby mitchell which willie the one vvho for so long has been a terror to quarterbacks around the league nearly always smacking tlum down on key plays which willie the guy whose teammates dub feel good because of his enthusiasm for football despite his years the guy who as the teams defensive captain the past four years field generals his teammates and off the field serv es as a liaison man between them and the packer coaches com eying griev anccs interpreting team rules and regulations helping playersespecially rookiesmake the proper adjustment to green bay willie davis is the guy who takes seriously excoach vince lombardi s frequent remark that the three things that should matter most to you are family religion and green bay footballnot necessarily in that order to lombardis list davis vvoidd add a fourth itema business career since he plans to retire from football at the end of this year heretofore football uncertainties like the possibility of being traded had hampered his business plans you might start a business in one town where youre a hero and then be traded to another he says besides if youre in any sort of business you have to watch it all year you cant spend six months away with a football team retirement will free him to monitor the he has invested in the stock market to oversee the flat apartment building in green bay he coowns with teammate herb adderly to help run with teammatcbusiness partners bob skoronski and ron kostelnik the appleton wis school supply finn which grossed million last year davis will also devote more time to his training stint at milwaukees joseph schlitz brewing co which points to a vnee presidency he might even have time to tend his new home in glendale wis i hope the success orientation i built up in football will carry over into business he says if i hadnt succeeded i dont know if i would have had the confidence to go into business w illie davis has been preparing tor his retirement since when he began studying for his masters last year after oiir first super bowl game he recalls i missed a quarter at the university of chicago i was worn out physically and emotionally i made up my mind that the same thing wouldnt happen in i played in the super bowl of course and in the pro bowl i was twoandahalf weeks late starting classes meanwhile however i had registered and was looking at my books at every opportunity this year i was certain to make the whole run i wanted to get that degree behind me the star lineman had dreamed of a business career ever since he was a kid in his hometown texarkana rk but in a sense his own athletic excellence stood in his way captain of the football and basketball teams he also played on the baseball squad at the local booker t washington high school a deans list student for his last two years at grambling college davis was graduated in after a sensational football season two vears in the army followed when he returned to civilian life he began playing for the cleveland browns and married his wife ann my first year with the browns i started in about games davis recalls right off the bat i had it made the next year though i was in and out now i was cxnfused right then i realized the contrast that one year yon can be on top of the world and months later be at the bottom i realized how frustrating it would be when the day finally arrived that i couldnt play football and would have to face the world with a reduced salary and no talents so i planned for a career i liked football but it offers very limited opportunities for a lifetime career on the other hand the world of business is boundless so i prepared myself for business and im not going into it as willie davis the football hero but as willie davis the potential executive meanwhile the browns gave up on davis and traded him to green bay in two years earlier the packers had finished dead last with a mark and earned a reputation around the nfl as the last team anyone wanted to be traded to unruly players would be warned by their coaches if you dont like it here well send you to green bay but davis transfer from the browms bench to a packer starting post proved a blessing that same year green bay captured the vtstern division title and went on to win world championships in and from on the team never finished below second davis believes green bay has a good chance of winning the nfl title again this year but with as many as veterans retiring within two years he predicts a packer decline not wanting to suffer through a losing seasonwith the team he seeks a new career in which he will be competing with men who have had a year head start it might be sometime before his annual salary again tops or before he attracts his current batch of more than speech engagements a year he says resolutely im willing to jiay the price to reach the top l ike most of his black teammates and an increasing number of blacks in general willie davis wears his hair natural both because it is stylish and because he wants to co er his bald spots there is nothing revolutionary about his views on the predicament of black people however dont think bitterness helps he says tv e seen a good deal of progress in the last years or so texarkana his hometown is a good example went to a segregated high school there and none of us got the opportunities white kids got it was tough for a negro growing up in the south to keep a sense of direction why bother to study when your ability and knowledge wont help you to get a job now the schools are integrating even in texarkana and opportunities are gradually opening up but oh so slowly were in a transitional period im not bitter now but if i look around in years and see the same conditions maybe i will be bitter while da is admits that black players are systematically excluded from quarterbacking in pro football he is indecisix e about whether they are restricted from other positions because of race or lack of talent you just dont know he says i do beliex e though that lombardi has been quite fair he applauds a new packer policy of assigning rookies to rooms on the road alphabetically so that housing integration will be achiex ed as a matter of course he believes he has never sulfered embarrassment because of race on the football field there is a certain sophistication that surrounds the game he says this has just about eliminated the sort of player that uses racial epithets davis is pursuing a business career because he is a great believer in green power as the answer to the problems of black people as a member of expro footballer jim brown s negro industrial economic union he is instnimental in securing loans for budding black businesses were not looking for fabulous success stories he explains just guys who can succeed in small businesses like dry cleaning small stores restaurants anything this is probably more important to the average negro than seeing a negro senator or supreme court justice its not something out of reach its annoying that people often look upon any organization with the words negro or black in the title and brand it as violent or radical nobody gets excited about the sons of italy or bnai brith g a springer is a skilled and independent craftsman plying a currently unfashionable trade against the tide of assemblyline machine technology that threatens to remov e all human variety from our artifacts his skill is in bedding and furniture and he has been in the business for years working out of small shops and lofts on manhattans east side he started his business with a tiny investmcait in when he was years old and cjuickly generated a clientele composed in part of some of new yorks wealthiest families familiar names like ford vanderbilt chrysler bergdorfgoodman and broun made their way into springers receipt book and to a lesser extent still do perhaps because his work is done exclusively by hand with numerous imported materials springer insists there isnt a concern in this country that knows bedding the way i do springer is a naturalized american citizen who emigrated from barbados with his father years ago and is a member of a prominent west indian family a cousin errol w barrow is prime minister of barbados another cousin dr hugh springer was the first black governor of barbados and is now that country s education minister and a third cousin dr christopher springer is a respected mathematician but despite his pride in his family g a springer believ es black people everywhere have a greater need for industrial producers than for scholars and intellectuals one of his strongest convactions is that black people must learn the techniques of business and get into the industrial field we consume everything and produce nothing sharing w ith many younger students of society the view that a renaissance of the human touch can be expected in the postindustrial age springer is certain that continued affluence will create a demand for expert craftsmanship people will become more and more interested in the uniqueness and quality which results from good craftsmanship he predicts black men and women should be training now to fill that demand he insists if you can make a product better than anyone else people will buy it color has nothing to do with it s pringers proudest claim is that the round bed he made in was the countrys first in short that he is the inventor of the round bed summing up other round bed makers the vinegary craftsman says theyre all imitators who still cant make them as well as can he is working on a new round bed with a boxspring of tufted hair and felt that will be as suitable for sleeping as the mattress itself he intends to patent the bed convinced that the bedding industry will remain prosperous springer is eager to teach his craft to young black men most of the men who have worked with me have been white he explains because my people have never been given the opportunity to learn the business the way i practice it he points out that he uses only the finest jnaterials in constructing his bedding and furniture burlap and webbing imported from india twine from italy and his work includes not only custommade boxsprings and mattresses but also chairs and couches to bring black men into his business he has offered to work with various groups on a program designed to teach young people the nidiments of the bedding and furniture industry springer one of whose endearing quirks is an inclination to refer to himself in the third person puts it this way before mr springer retires he would like to train some young black men to take over this business build it up and develop into topdrawer craftsmen then mr springer will retire t he setting was a typical sophisticated party in a large midwestern city gathered in the comfortable livedin living room of the host were newspapermen authors several professors a minister or two politicians businessmen an african several foreigners from the consular set and enough black people to make the gathering democratic among the politicians was a young and promising jewish congressman with several terms in washington already under his belt he was an intelligent jolitically honest perceptive young man in a small group at one end of the room two of the black guests were talking politics witli an older jewish businessman they were bemoaning the fact that too often black politicians do not truly represent the black people who actually voted them into office the businessman agreed there are times he said in essence when we have the same trouble even he nodding toward the congressman sometimes forgets they and everyone in the group knew he was talking about the white gentile majority have so many to represent them we have so few weve got plenty of nothing i f the jews think today that they have few politicians to represent them what about black people some million blacks form better than per cent of the population of the united states the possibility of any one of them being elected president in say the next years is laughable there is one black senator only five of the seats in the house of representatives are occupied by blacks there are no black governors only two elected black mayors of important cities and still just a smattering of aldermen and councilmen there are few black sheriffs only a few black police chiefs none in major cities no elected secretaries of state state treasurers lieutenant governors etc there may be a few black dog catchers but we dont have figures on those black people can swing certain elections but on the whole still must depend on liberal whites for the passage of any state or federal legislation to better their cause these liberal whites are often so busy representing tlie liberal whites that they find tliemselves horsetrading with notsoliberalwhites many times black people end up being shortchanged by liberal friends it becomes an i wont vote for urban affairs if you promise to vote for lessening of tariffs kind of thing and black pele as usual lose everybody voteand vote wisely t he only solution to this dilemma lies in a judicious use of the black vote every black person qualified to vote should go to the polls both in the primaries see memphis voters on opposite page and in the general elections every black person who still finds anyone tampering with his right to vote should fight to attain what is supposedly guaranteed to all citizens under the constitution north south east and westblack people should make a concentrated effort to register all eligible voters and should follow this up with an effective push to actually get them to the polls it is time for the black votethat powerful black vote we often talk aboutto really assert itself getting the black vote to the polls is only half the solution the cause will be served only if this vote is cast for the man whether he be black or white who will represent black people sincerely in every issue that affects americas largest minority by necessity the black voter today must be a selfish voter he has waited too long endured too much and has been too patient he can no longer afford to waste his vote as it has too often been wasted in the past his vote today should be for salebut not for sale for petty dollars he should ask of the man seeking his support are you going to pay me off in legislation guaranteeing me full citizenship are you going to fight for my right to vote for my right to live where i please are you going to fight for my childrens right to a firstclass meaningful education are you going to campaign openly for my right to the job for which im qualified are you going to speak out for my right to make full use of public facilities anywhere under our flag are you willing to stand up and be counted among those who are determined to make the united states a full democracy at which no outsider can point a finger and say but look how you treat your blacks if any candidate hedges on his answers if he tries to hide behind party platforms or organization programs avoid him like you would the plague if he gives an unqualified yes to all these questions then look at his record if his record is together then he has earned your vote our politicians must lead ike the black voter the black politician must also of necessity be selfish not personally selfish but selfish for the minority he represents the black office holder either elected or appointed cannot afford to be a statesman or an unselfish idealist until full citizenship is gained for all blackswith all the benefits as well as the responsibilities entailed in firstclass citizenshipthe black politician must be a black man first and a politician second in washington the southern representative or senator who logs enough years to earn a committee chairmanship in congress will do everything in his power to keep civil_rights legislation bottled up in committee on the floor of the house or senate southern congressmen can be counted on to vote against any bill that might affect their outworn undemocratic racial traditions they will battle their president and their party leaders on this issue on the other hand black representatives too often seem to lean backward in their attempts to prove that they are fair and impartial more and more blacks are going to washington and they owe it to black people to work selfishly for black progress just as white southern legislators work selfishly to uphold the traditions they feel their constituents still favor we ask no favors lack people today are demanding only those rights supposedly guaranteed them under the concept of democratic government the united states constitution and the federal laws of the land they are asking for no favors no special privileges because their demands are right they will no longer compromise and they will no longer allow black leaders to equivocate the fight is now being led by college students such young ministers as chicagos rev jesse l jackson social workers and civic organizations these must be joined by black politiciansby those black politicians who wish to retain any status as black leaders they must prove that their first allegiance is to the race and their second to organization or party the time has come for the new black man to make himself evident not only on college camiduses and in southern church pulpits but at the polls and in the legislative houses despite what muslim leader elijah muhammad and other black separatists say the great majority of americas million blacks are not seeking a separate country within the boundaries of the united states despite what fanatical and reactionary white rightists might want to believe few black americans intend to go back to africa after more than years of socalled freedom the black american is demanding only what he ought to have already had the right to live in full freedom as a firstclass citizen of his own country the united states a judicious use of tlic black vote this year can push him far toward that goal a t first the negro gls around cam ranh bay army camp in south vietnam didnt believe i was real as soon as i had arrived the word spread like wildfire that there was a soul sister at the red cross recreation center a numher of fellows rushed down to find out if it was true they couldnt believe it when their buddies told them and had to see for themselves but i was there all righti barbara lynn of youngstown ohio and for one year from july to august s i spent practically all my time trying to make those guys forget about the war and relax in a v ariety of recreational activities our props were homemade and often simplegames puzzles tricks and quizzesbut our programs provided the men with a break in the daily routine and our presence proved quite a morale booster knowing that i would be the only negro girl among the college graduates working as recreation specialists with the red cross in that part of vietnam i had expected to be popular among the brothers but i had never dreamed that my being there would mean so much to them many fellows told me that it made them feel good to know that they had someone there to remind them of home the white girls at the center were nice they said but seeing a sister when you came back from the rice paddies was something else before i arrived many negro soldiers thought they had been forgotten that the women back home didnt care for them or maybe were not being invited to come over my being there proved it wasnt tnic and coming to vietnam with the red cross was to my mind just a stroke of luck i have always been interested in working with people as an undergraduate at bennett college in greensboro n c spent two summers working with migrant workers children in new york state after graduating in i applied to the peace coiqis and was sent to venezuela to work on an urban development project in the slums for two years it was there that i learned about the red cross recreation program in vietnam from a coworker who bad served in a similar red cross program in korea the idea of going to ietnam fascinated me id be able to see the world and serve my country at the same time and i wanted to find out firsthand what the war was about so when returned to the united states from venezuela i contacted the red cross and after several interv iews i was accepted naturally my decision was greeted with mixed feelings by my family and friends my mother worried about my safety and some friends thought i was crazy to volunteer for such a dangerous job but my father who served for four years during world war ii thought it was the chance of a lifetime his v iew was shared by my grandmother she thinks its wonderful that i have been able to take advantage of so many opportunities that were not open to negroes when she was young when first arrived in ietnam in july i found myself stationed in a support area where there was a large red cross center men could nisit the center anytime during open hours from am to pm and play pool or pingpong watch telex ision read magazines or books or just xxtite letters many of them just wanted to talk and visit with the girls from back home when we werent busy in the centers we prepared for our clubmobile runs which took us to soldiers in the field our clubmobile could be anything from a huey helicopter to a truck or jeepanything that xvould get us oxer the terrain anxxvay xxe xvould paint small props and think up amusing games for the guys we found they anticipated our one hour a xveek programsespecially xxdien thev xxere stuck out in the combat zones xvith little chance for other entertainment or relaxation in the center i really got to knoxv many of the men x ho xvould come over and chat often just to get a xvoman s opinion on some of their problems usually they xv ould discuss their families or wix es or sxveethearts so many xvere lonely so many yearld gis had never been axx ay from home before and nex er got any letters so at first i didnt find life in xietnam too tough xvar or no xvar sure the facilities didnt add up to luxuryif you didnt get yourself a vmmasan ietnamese maid you faced the prospect of handxvashing all of your laundry in cold xvater and then there xvere the long xxwking hours the curfexvs the heat and humidity but the men xvere xvonderful their appreciation of our efforts made it all xvorthxxhile yet i remember heartbreaking chores too like our weekly visits to the base hospital we xvould try to talk to the patients and cheer them up but xxe saxv so many xvho xxere so young and xvould suffer permanent injury as a result of the xvar many xvere maimed and mangled for life and yet they xvere so cheerfulsometimes it xxas they xvho boosted our morale instead of the other xvay around three times during the year mox ed to different recreation center assignments for the red cross it xvasnt until the fourth that i got my first taste of real danger from the enemy with the th infantr at cu chi near saigon learned hoxv to live in a combat zone the first month we were rocketed almost every night and one xveek xve girls had to sleep in a bunker due to the persistent enemy fire when xve xvere not being rocketed or mortared u s b bombers carried out airstrikes against the enemy outside our perimeter so in either case there xvas a lot of noise and rattling of course i xvas scared sometimesespecially xxhen the building right next to our house xvas completely demolished by a rocketbut you learned to live with it you just couldnt go around xvorrying all the time we learned to recognize the sound of an approaching rocketit makes a xvhistling noise like a boiling tea kettle and lands xvith a wump when xve heard those sounds xve hit the floor the soldiers told us if xve remained standing during an attack the shrapnel xvould cut us in half there is a second lull betxveen rocket attacks and during those intervals against liquor and gambling at the centers but in addition to that the men wanted us there and really tried to behave so they wouldnt lose us dating in the american sense was almost impossiblethere was no place to goand usually we spent our evenings olfduty with various militaiy units sometimes there would be as many as four parties on the same evening to celebrate a units return from a mission a promotion or somebodys end of tour and we had to attend all of them in order not to disapjoint the fellows i did some datingyou had a choice between going to a movie going swimming visiting the officers or enlisted mens lounge or just talking in the livingroom of our quartersbut what pleased me most was that i was able to form so many boygirl friendships without romantic overtones i met a number of fellows with whom i became very closeit was like having older brothers brothers i never had i have one sister and a brother now that im home i can look back on my experiences and sec how theyve changed me before i went over there i really had no inkling as to what war was really like my father had told me about his experiences overseas during world war ii and as a history major i had read about wars in my textbooks hut you just cannot visualize the horrors of war from a distance during my months in vietnam i became more conscious of how precious life is and i learned to treasure every moment of it now i hope that many more negro girls will apply to the red cross for vietnam duty an experience i would not have missed for anything the pay is comparatively lowwhen i was promoted from recreation aide to unit director i received about every month after taxesbut you can actually save a large portion of your salary since your housing is rentfree and you only pay a minimal fee to the military for food youre entitled to one best and recuperation trip to a nearby country and if youre willing to pay for your own transportation by commercial airline you can travel abroad on your annual leave tlie red cross wanted me to stay on but i had signed up for only one year and at the end of my tcnn i wanted to move on into some other area in the social services field i hope to become a social worker but for that i need a masters degree and ill probably go back to school next year i hope to marry some day and settle down hut not yeti want to accomplish most of my goals and get the wanderlust out of my blood first my experiences in vietnam will be of great value to me for many years to come i hope many other girlsespecially black girlswill make use of this wonderful opportunity to learn as well as to give a s countries gathered in mexico city for the olympic games the eyes of the sporting world were on americas black athletes their participationor lack of itin track and field events would have definite bearing on the outcome of the th olympiad for if they ran they were almost sure to win and nin they would despite a threatened boycott because of racism in the u s somethingperhaps their innate pride in their abilitieshad forced the best of black athletes to the whitehot anvil of world competition the boycott was called off at least for now ralph boston coholder of the world long jump record offered an explanation at the men athletes south lake tahoe training center we have an unusual amount of talent among black athletes if we didnt go to the olympics we wouldnt be hurting this country wed be hurting the olympic games the boycott movement had been led by california college professor dr harry edwards and apparently had the sympathy of such top athletes as champion sprinter tommy smith but as training time drew near each black man who felt himself a world class athlete had to face the issue for himself most seem to have reached the conclusion drawn by yearold art walker american record holder and former world indoor record holder in the triple jump says walker a morehouse college graduate earning a year in the early stages of his career as a systems engineer with ibm ive thought about it a lot naturally and quite frankly i just dont see that a boycott would do any good the only thing it would do would show black america that the black amateur athletes do identify with the cause i dont think it would solve anything i think it would merely keep the guys from having the chance to compete in the olympics but i think we still ought to do something anyway to let black america know we identify black athletes may very well do something in mexico city it has been suggested that they might wear black arm bands or if the mexican gods favor them with victory refuse to accept their olympic medals says ralph boston if we decide on some kind of protest id be less than a man not to participate id be letting myself down my family my race i think these things are important its important that im an american citizen too but i think things have happened in this country that we know are not as they

i have been obtaining copies of ebony for some time now and would like to express my thanks and appreciation for a really great publication the articles arc colorful informative and when thy deal with white prejudice and persecution dignified and restrained ftcr reading such articles i fccl bitterly ashamed of my race and colour for i am a wasp white anglosaxon protestant and i find it almost ixvond belief that a low level of glutathione reductase fan enyine believed to ik responsible for the color of hunuin skinl should expose afroamericans to bigotry and prejudice and a condition of near slavery for the vast majority which has only been surpassed by the shu e labourers of nazi germany in the fight for freedom and equality ebony is a iocrfid force and a guardian of the important right

the stage for the american revolution was superbly written and quite enlightening upon completing the article an insurgent force within led me to compare the historical facts with those in other reliable sources it came as no sur prise to find that attucks was portrayed is a man of unknown origin and a hotheiided dock worker in the past historians and researchers felt obligated to omit or disparage the contributions made by black men thanks to your magazine and men like lerone benimtt we can now learn the true facts rubye m joilnson brooklvn n y defends booker t excuse me but i found your article the forgotten hero of civil_rights ebonx june most imitative not because i object to your portrayal of your hero but because i object to your defaming one of our noblest saint booker taliaferro washington in order to establish your point for example you wrote it was trotter who mobilizetl the forces that checked the triumphant advance of booker t washingtons program of accomincklation and sidmission in the first place nothing could be further from tnith than an assertion that booker t washington was an advocate of submission or accommodation so why is it that so many of our socalled black leaders and citizens oppose the doctrine of st booker tee how is it that m tlnnk nothing of ridiculing and undermining the character and doctrine of a man who did so much for usand during a period which rendered his accomplishments incredible just how docs the ideology of this exslave eftect our particular idiosyncrasies it is startling even to this date to learn that william trotter startled the nation by challenging booker t washington at tire outset of his career perhajw that is one of the reasons tlie name and works of tire late mr trotter have remained relatively obscure while great men such as booker t washington are renoun as authors of historytheir otl cahholle bhes carson city ne source of pride it is for me a personal source of pride to realize just how far euony and the other johnson publications have come over tlie vears and how their liiality has contiiuiecl to improve some of the opinions expressed by your contributors are outrageously silly especially your recent piece on the au naturel hair style however while providing an opportunity for some very influential ie black americans ie aframericans ad nuusettm to say some very stupid things euony invariably retains its sense of balancc and manages to keep up the good work i would only ask for more articles like the evolution of afroamerican art and wider coverage of the south

what makes the attitude of mr christie and so many others who agree with him so monstrous is that he didnt even know the people whose suftering and death he blandly calls justified most of them were negroes yet because white men practiced or tolerated slavery more than years ago mr christie can callously and cynically write off the deatlcs of scores of peoix black and white in the riots as

probably they are indifferent t happen to be an american born of italian immigrants t think many of us hav forgiven the riots among ethnic groups in our country only years ago how can prejudice and

controversy voiced at the recent conferences of the naacp and the equal rights organizations i heartily agree with those who maintain that the american negroes best policy is to acquire all the education they possibly can and prepare themselves for the jobs they are demanding how evit good education depends on good teachers who for the present arc mostly irainetl in imiversities founded and maintained by the group they so hate after nearly two centuries in america it would take more than colorful robes and bushy hair to convince evon the africans that they are soul brothers having lost their national heritage by circumstances over which they had no control and which was aided and abetted by fellow africans who raided other tribes and sold them to the slaverunners isnt it about time they stopped harping about slavery and create a new heritage for tlicmselvcs as american nationals africa does not want them unless tliey have something to offer besides their black_power and no other nation will have them so why not learn a lesson from the jews who a generation ago were just as despised in america but today through education and acquired wealth most of it from negro ghettos they can influence both the domestic and foreign policy of the united states although they send millions of dollars annuallv to israel not many hae any intention of taking up their abode there until they own all the arabs lands the only power that will bring freedom from ignorantc and poverty is not black but green backed by yellow gold and the sooner the american young hotheads who would destroy

of black extremists making common cause with the arab world against the state of israel some peoplf may be lacking in knowledge of hisforv but it will not take much research to discov er that the arabs were among the prime movers of the internal african slave trade and it should be kept in mind that a large part of this black slave traffic was directly for the mohammedan east i snggst then thit the followirs of the radical black movement ask their historians about the arab ami egyptian role in the transport and taking of free black human beings into american and mohammedan slaverv t further suggest that if they ask which nations have persisted into modern times in maintaining the institution of slavery against the conscience of the world they will find the answer in arabia further suggest that vou print for their enlightenment what arabs are doing to blicks in the sudan right now you might also publicize the current deeds of the egyxtian mercenaries in nigeria when this

melting pot islands of harmony land of brotherhood whcre residents of all colors should be able to live together in peace and there are a thousand cases where this is true yet there is also ample evidence of a nightmare of bias and bigotry in corners of paiadise and without question there are people who shrug and sidestep the whole thing who relegate the negro to hotel and maunakea streets vvho tolerate him as a necessary transient evilwho thank god they do not live in newark or detroit where they vvould have to declare their secret convictions openly as every american has learned painfully this year the race problem in the u s is a complex and baflling one this is reflected and confirmed when one begins to examine the subject of the negro in hawaiiin fact the situation in the islands emerges as more complicated more varied and perhaps even more baffling than that of the mainland two unique facts make this true first the majority of hawaiis negroes are in the military to which by its very nature is a life of displacement and uncertainty second the civilian negroes in the islands are detached by thousands of miles and an ocean of watcr from the core of the black civdl rights moementthey know about it only indirectly and they feel it only vicariously nevertheless two sweeping statements can be made of the negro in hawaii his attitude depends heavily on who he is and what he does his philosophy is exceptionally shaped by the degree of his personal adjustment or maladjustment success or failure happiness or unhappiness he is less likely to define his problems knowingly or not he is ambivalent things arent as good as they should be but they are good enough to make him tolerate the bad without much articulation actually most people in hawaii are not aware of the negro this is because they do not see him very often micn they do he is usually wearing a military uniform or he is entertaining or preparing food or driving a truck for most he exists just on the fringes of hawaiian life it is tnie that some negroes are schoolteachers civil service workers or employed at pearl harbor black people may be found in government roles and even in a case or tv as successful professional men without question the negro in hawaii is generally dismissed on the grounds of his very small minority in island population but this in itself poses honest questions why is the negro so sparsely represented in a land which on the surface would seem so inviting to him and whatever his numbers as a minority how can this justify inequality and discrimination in a land allegedly renowned for its indifference to race creed or color hawaii lias a chapter of the national association of the advancement of colored people the local chapter has been in existence for the past ten years it has many white members as well as negroes hawaiis chapter has perhaps members and many of these are not active it appears to have little attraction for most negroes and does not seem to be very militant in its local efforts much of this however can again be explained by the heavy proportion of transient negroes in the military and by the hesitancy of local citizens to make waves in paradise and perhajis end up with more problems than they began with dr clifford roberts the president of the local naacp chapter is a retired podiatrist who came to hawaii in his ancestry is cherokee indian spanish and some negro dr roberts is elderly mildmannered softspoken he is conserative in his discussion of the problem but admits frankly that discrimivarftd interests of hubert while administrative food service director for large hawaiian corioration include ninning an island negro press service and working with young people as public relations director of ymca he takes baikpietspeaking duties in stride nation does exist in hawaii locally he sees two trends which may imxrove the situation in hawaii he has noted that some large business organizations of hawaii are now asking for negro workers while he recognizes that most of this is designed to satisfy the government and fair employment practices still he thinks it might begin to break down established prejudice he also notes the heavy increase in negro visitors to the islands by serving these tourists islanders he feels will become more accustomed to negro people but the most significant thing which dr roberts declares and which seems to speak for so many negroes in hawaii is compared to the mainland hawaii is very much better in fewer restrictions and more freedom for the negroit is not perfect but it is much better further views on the negro question comes from the military one service man whose name must remain anonymous not only reiterated dr roberts statement that the balance of good in hawaii over the bad keeps the average negro from complaining but he referred to the military in much the same manner asked about the reputation of the military for its lack of discrimination he said it is admittedly the best of existing situations but it is still far from perfect he said that he blieved it was hard for the negro to advance in rank and pointed out there is still only one negro general in all the u s armed forces editors note the recent promotion of army col frederic e davison to brigadier general has meanwhile raised that number to two a little like detroit he said the best in the land when it came to civil_rightsbut just not good enough a man of strong convictions he believes many kinds of discrimination exist in hawaii but that it is worse against the negro he himself was rejected many times when he attempted to buy a home he explains the prevalence of the negro military men on hotel street and surrounding environs as the result of the refusal of local girls to date negro soldiers an interesting comment recurring in a number of our interviews was that the local haole girl is far more amenable to dating negroes than is the oriental primarily the japanese girl this military man is unusual in that he feels such an emotional involvement with the black movement on the mainland that he is currently debating whether or not to resign from the serv ice and return why dont more negroes come to hawaii to settle is it the cost of living yes he replied and that is compounded when you have no particular industry that has invited them to come but more than this the mainland negro is already pretty thoroughly disenchanted with the myth of hawaiis great racial harmony there are thousands of negro servicemen passing through hawaiiand the stories most of them take back to the mainland are enough to discourage any negro from seeking utopia here a surv ey taken among whitecollar workers turned up some revealing and often surprising attitudes this survey included all races and nationalitiesprimarily younger people who do not at present have negro fellow employes in posing questions the interviewer described a hypothetical negro as personable intelligent courteous educated and in every way acceptable he was also described as very darksince studies show that lightskinned negroes are more acceptable to some people the interviewer asked how they would feel about haing a negro as a coworker the answer was unanimous no problem vmien asked how they would feel about a negro as their immediate supervisor again the answer was unanimous no problem how they would feel if a negro bought the house next door a few had doubts but again the majority fully accepted the possibility but then came the question how would they feel if their daughter dated a negro or if she married a negro suddenly the picture changed the great majority drew the line here they said in eifect no dice how they would characterize hawaiis attitude toward the negro prejudiced unprejudiced or partly prejudiced they statcd unanimously partly prejudiced people want equality for the negro said one so long as it doesnt affect them personally one local caucasian believed that hawaii tolerates the negro because of the small number living here but that the state still does not accept them an oriental admitted there is strong prejudice among the orientals of hawaii toward the negro particularly among the older orientals a prejudice exceeding that of the mainland what is clear about the results is that total acceptance is unquestionedup to a point beyond that point of personal involvement rejection is just as total and just as clear most significant of the replies perhaps is that of a personnel director his views are openly in favor of negro hiring and assimilation yet the fact that his company has not a single negro on its payroll would suggest that his management restrains or discourages him from converting his convictions to practice the grim fart ft racial prejudice is mans most irrational and ignominious emotion few people can explain it even in themselves the fact that every person belongs to a minority docs not seem to get through the fact that science says there is no such thing as a superior or inferior race seems to cut no ice the fact that america has been built out of the very strengths of her multiple races seems lost in the shuffle several personality sketches follow this general examination of the negro in hawaii they portray a variety of experiences and a fusion of conclusions in general they confirm that the problem varies with the individual experience from happy to tragic solly ward jr aged is a tall gangling young man who is going places he has verve drive ambition charm energyand very little time or desire to reflect on the fact that he is a negro in the story of the negro in hawaii solly ward emerges as different in many ways for one thing he was bom and reared here in the islands owner of a luxurioos home plus a profitable red cap service at honolulu airport emest golden is a longtime resident of hawaii his family gathers for informal livingroom portrait to r kevin golden karen carl mrs golden and keith solly attended catholic schools on oahu graduating from st louis high school and after a term at honolulu business college entered chaminade where he is now majoring in marketing he will graduate in and will immediately pursue his masters degree in the same field at the university but being a student is only half of solly wiuds youthful story despite the fact that his folks are rather comfortable financially solly has worked at dozens of jobs i go into the world standing up smiling making people aware that im aware of them he explains when you go into a room i believe you bring your own atmosphere with youron create the image people are going to have of you too many negroes go into that room already certain that they will face dislike and intoleranceand as a result they do because theyve brought that feeling with them he remembers back in seventh grade in waipahu when he got his first taste of race prejudice a group of haole mainland kids brought a confederate flag to school and boastingly declared that they were about trchini solly ward back to sla cry the trigger had been pulled and true to youth and group psychology the rest of the local kids joined tlie painful game but for that incident solly doesnt recall much racial buffeting he heard nigger maybe ten timesmore often it was popolo hawaiian for somebody very dark hes had people cultivate him out of curiosity and to see what makes him tickbut in the end most of them stayed on as genuine and incurious friends did he have trouble dating girls because of prejudice no he grins in reply never any trouble with the girlsbut very often trouble with the parents unmarried he is currently dating a girl of portiigueseenglishhawaiian extraction when the time comes for marriageto whomeverhe sees no problem hig views curiously solly thinks honolulu doesnt consider the negro a permanent part of hawaii and for that reason doesnt take him seriously partly this is due to the military he thinks and their transient role in the community he bluntly believes the military create much of hawaiis harsh impression of the negro solly ward is against violence and against black_power he is also against open housing laws because he believes that telling any man whom to sell his house to is a breach of constitutional rights when he is ready to buy a home someday solly anticipates no problems he has a passive philosophical attitude toward restricted organizations such as some yachting clubs no sweat there he shnigs they just break themselves down in time despite his devotion to hawaii and his optimistic outlook solly has been exposed to mainland bigotry in full bloom six months in the los angeles area shook him to his nonviolent roots and sent him packing home with pleasure but he had learned some lessons he would not forget sollys father came to hawaii as a contract worker for the navy in today he is the highestranking negro in local civil service blue collar ranks he is a patient man who has earned the respect of workers neighbors and citizens he owns his home and has served as vice president of the local community association solly knows that his is not an average experience for a negro and he is right he has hadand does havemore going for him than many young people of any race exceptional upbringing by exceptional parents roots in hawaii rather than a transplanting talent and intelligence an outgoing personality and an inborn refusal to let racial prejudice distract him from his personal goals patt patterson is one of the best known and best liked men in the honolulu business community he is also negro pattas he is universally knowncame to hawaii in as a young boy to visit his mother he stayed following difficult early years he subsequently worked in honolulu as a window display man an hrt driver and a fireman he then became a radio deejay moving from kani now klei to khon and ultimately to kgu where he became operations manager then came advertising he worked for compton carey and pope associates and then formed his own firm patt patterson associates two years ago he has been eminently successful although he deems himself as only beginning in his drive to have the best agency in hawaii at present he has a staff of eight all haolesand billings fast approaching a million dollars married to a caucasian he and his wife arlene have three daughters he sees no problems in the future for them if we teach them right and prepare them i see no sweat he sums it up briefly patt admits that in the early years it was undoubtedly more difficult for his wife several times they were turned down in their search for housing while this didnt disturb him he knows it was not easy for arlene yet today the patterson backyard is the happy neighborhood hangout for kids housing and social problems seem far behind but patt patterson is no fool about the existence of a racial problem at a meeting in colorado of the advertising agency association to which he belongs it had been proposed and accepted that the next convention be held in atlanta ga patt got to his feet and slyly suggested that this might not be too great an ideaat least he said it could be a little uncomfortable for him his cohorts immediately grasped the implications reversed their decision and substituted palm springsall as a gesture of respect for patt there is a slogan on patt pattersons office wall and he constantly passes out pins which carry the same words do it this may well be the key to many aspects of the man selfeducated he wanted to succeed in his own business so he simply set out to do it he wanted to marry the girl he loved regardless of race so he did it he dominates the gridiron show every year because of his contagious verve and determination to do it everything in his life seems to say dont sit around and think about itdo it charles campbell not only teaches american problems and sociology at farrington high schoolhe is involved in both charles campbell was a delegate to the white house conference on civil_rights he is also chairman of the hawaiian advisory committee to the u s commission on civil_rights is advisor to the teen agers assemblyand is involved in many other civic organizations and projexts all of which have a common theme how to solve human problems and make a better world bom in north carolina he has spent considerable time in the lower east side of new york city harlem chicago newark and teaneck n j he has been a teacher a newscaster a settlement house worker and a ymca worker he has been in hawaii six years like others campbell agrees that hawaii is far ahead of other states in race and human relations but that very fact makes him worry that citizens will tend to relax and become complacent he feels the hard tmth is that the aloha spirit is not indestnictible at all in fact there are forces threatening it right now one of the strongest being an economic blessing massive tourism campbell has given the city council the mayor and others specific suggestions along this line for one he recommended that the council set up a commission to look into potential exthe buckingham corporation importers new york ny distilled and bottled in scotland blended proof plosive areas in the community and to keep the council constantly informed of dangers and breakdowns in the hannony of the community he also proposed an orientation program for newcomers to the islands the program not compulsory but strongly promoted would be an indoctrination of and about the aloha spirit of hawaii its purpose would be to help new arrivals avoid bringing to the islands all of their old prejudices and set ways and at the same time to build up a reser oir of persons actively promoting the aloha spirit campbells views appear fresh and simple and totally sound yet one can imagine that both ideas were poohpoohed vocally or inwardly by officials with the indignant what explosive areas and you cany preach aloha it has to grow on you at least no action was ever taken on either of these recommendations charles campbell thinks that local people who hide their prejudices or who avoid any declaration behind i dont know the negro how can i know what i feel about him are moutliing utter nonsense they know the negro very well he says just the way all of us know the negroes the hippies the antiwar protesters and even individuals like kosygin and de gaullethrough the media of newspaper t radio and magazines which feed us constant and indepth infonnation about all these and more one of his beliefs is that we imitate each other in race relations and in this way actually create intolerance where none really exists he means for instance tliat most haoles act toward the negro the way he thinks his fellow haoles expect him to act and the same is true he believes about all races nationalities and other groups charles campbell is married to a caucasian he teaches in a school made up of white oriental filipino hawaiian and a few negro students he knows the mainland and he is actively involved in hawaii when it came to housing he has never had a problem but when we asked about social or job bias he grinned a little its hard to tell he said which pinpoints one of the most insidious aspects of bigotry if a person is white or oriental he has undoubtedly had an unpleasant experience of very poor service from a waitress or a hotel desk clerk or a sales person he might get mad but usually chalks it up to simple rudeness or arrogance the negro on the other hand invariably finds himself asking himself is it because of mtj color e very year since international beauty contests hae become both big business and big prime time television entertainment negro iewers have watched cynically just to sec how far they will let a black beauty go this year the miss universe beauty pageant gave black viewers a nin for their money in a truly universal contest that included contestants from white south africa and the black congo democratic republic one dark girl anne marie braaflieid from the island of curacao just off the coast of venezuela proved early that she had the looks talent and personality to be a winner mien the contestants were weeded dowm to semifinalists anne marie with her dark brown eyes black hair and sparkling smile was still in the running when the five finalists were announced the fivcfootsix pound charmer was among those who still had a chance completely at ease she heard the fourth third and second runners up announced this meant that cither she or her friend martha vasconcellos miss brazil would be miss universe the judges final decision went to miss brazil and nne marie was the first to congratulate her and anne maries showing near miss though it was brought the day a step closer when a dark beauty will be named the most beautiful girl in the world s how riding for all ostensible purposes is about as exclusive as skiing at cstaad switzerland or sailing a nictcr yacht at newport it not only takes skill but it takes moneyand not many black people have seen their way into tlie rarilied circles of the horsey set that was not until edith west decided to enter competition the daughter of a washington d c truckdriver she was by any standards an unusual contestant in she became the first negro to ride in the maryland pony show and before spectators could overcome their surprise she went home with a blue ribbon and a cash prize two years later she rode on to win first prize in the junior jumper class at the washington international horse show with these first triumphs the whole family became infected with the spirit of the equestrian show today with her sister terry edith brings home approximately ribbons per season blit ediths parents george and willie west do not rest on just their daughters equitation laurels to encourage more negro youngsters to pursue the sport they established a show riding school and stable last year in spencerville md in between practicing for shows edith now teaches students the rudiments of good horsemanship although the wests readily admit that show riding is an expensive hobbya good horse may cost up to x and they spent just on tack saddles and bridlesthey hope to attract more students with low teaching fees and reasonable boarding rates they operate their stables yearround and during this summer season they were able to send six students to compete in the maryland pony show the nations largest showriding meet the wests hope to expand their enterprise and collect even more ribbons for their trophy room in the coming years but they do sadly admit one failure george jr the nonconformist in the family wants nothing to do with saddles and curry brushes an aspiring rock n roll drummer he recently sold his share in a prize pony to his sister for six cupcakesand thought he got the best end of the bargain w hen melvin van peebles the first black american to direct a featurelength motion picture arrived at the san francisco international film festival last summer he came not as an american but as a member of the french delegation and after his film the ston of a thi ccdny pamdirected edited and musically scored by him and based on a novel he himself had writtenhad won the festivals most enthusiastic acclaim van peebles like the traditional black expatriate he is quickly repaired to the paris that had given him his chance the travels of the manfrom his childhood in harvey ill to his early adulthood at ohio wesltwan university from his years as a san francisco cable car gripinan to his collisions with hollywood and american book publishers and from his first successes in amsterdam to his achievements in french filmsprovide eloquent testimony that even in the artistic sectors of american endeavor some crucial gateways remain locked to talented black men and now as the devious circuitry of american appreciation completes its course van peebles may sit back in his homeawayfromhome to watch new york mov iegoers applaud his work as a topnotch foreign import van peebles now with short films a musical revue a record album and four nov els to his credit is tightlipped and direct the fact that an american film company has acquired the pass for us distribution and has eontraeted for three more pietures has not diluted the impact of van peebles earlier experiences i guess what i want most in the world he says is to demonstrate that a negro can stand on his own two feet and be his own master if i make it as a director or writer ill make it on my own tenns i want to get the mims foot out of our backsides the two events that sent him scampering to europe occurred about eight years ago while working as a cable car gripman he made three short films selling his automobile to finance them when he took the pictures to hollywood hoping to find work as an apprentice he was told by an agent if you can tap dance i might find you some work but that is about all the second blow came when van peebles first novel was rejected by american publishers they told me he recalls that i didnt write enough like a negro once in europe he explains it took me tvvo vears to find out which way the wind was blowing and fiv e years to accomplish my goal when i learned that french law allowed writers to direct their mov ies my first step was to become a writer i went to work as a joumalist journalism enabled me to get a book publisher which made it possible to get other books published my screen treatment of the book earned a directors permit for me from the french film center vin peebles states the progression very simply but the seven y ears of effort vvxre neither simple nor easy for example when asked why he w rote the threeday pass he replies i was hungry but the journey may not have been as uncomfortable for him as it would have been for someone less extraordinary woven through his ambition seems to be an indifference to close personal ties his life revolves around his work i cant work and do everything else he says i see an awful lot of people in my business and i dont see outsiders if can avoid them vm peebles is eornpletely selftaught in filmmaking and his studies in that craft contain a heady admixture of pictorial journalism theatre and multilingualism his first book the big heart written in san francisco was a romantic picture stoiy of the cable cars on which he then worked later in paris he drew his livelihood from editing the filmlike comic sequences of mad magazines french edition theater represented one of his first challenges in europe after studying briefly at the university of amsterdam he won an acting job with the dutch national theater and toured holland in brendan behans play the hostage v an peebles move to paris put him through a transition similar to that of the th century naturalized british author joseph conrad as the polishspeaking conrad had in his s adopted english as his writing language van peebles at about the same age abandoned his native english to write in french i didnt know french when i came here he explains but i had to learn it to get along it was a case of no writey no eatey two of his early novels a bear for the fbi and the true american were written in english and translated into french his more recent novels the chinaman of the th and the threeday pass and a musical comedy fete a harlem he wrote in french all of his written works are published in france and are being translated into spanish van peebles is a recluse with simple tastes and irregular working habits his hermitic ways are so complete that when not working he seems to vanish into the texture of paris few people know his address or telephone number and he and his friends apparently have no compunction about circulating incorrect numbers to the nosey he does not fancy night life and oms neither a television nor radio set even though he lives alone as for the accumulation of worldly goodies he says i dont want to be hungry or cold when im writing but material things that make most people happylike big cars gourmet food and fine clothes are not my bag his working hours depend on what he is doing some days i sit and write for hours he notes on other days with other projects i can work only for a few hours at a time often i vary my pace by dropping a writing job and working on a technical problema marquee stage set table of contentsanything that requires a different type of concentration and if van peebles had anything to do with it his personal history would remain completely unknowti he admits to being born in chicagos st luke hospital in and to having been graduated from ohio wesleyan university with a degree in english literature but volunteers little else his former english professor dr robert marshall remembers liiin as a sensitive fellow with a mind that could be mercurial his writing particularly his poetry was rather chaotic but lyrical it is also known that he was an air force officer who served as a navigator and bombardier the film that has brought van peebles to prominence is a bittersweet love story of a black gi who picks up a french girl on a three day leave the couple travels from paris to the seashore enduring racial abuse and confronting their own racial fears along the way after an intense affair the soldier finds himself in a stark army barracks dialing a phoney number given him by the girl the picture was produced by opera office de production dedition et de realisation on a doo budget casting in the leading roles harry baird a west indian actor and nicole berger a former french television actress van peebles shot the film in si weeks van peebles ran every phase of the production according to him i told them do it my way or we wont do it he worked with the actors meddled in the cutting room prescribed the music controlled the whole show mickey baker formerly of the singing mickey and sylvia collaborated on the score the dialogue is french and english each actor speaking his own language and now with fame under his belt the new director is holding his cards very tightly he will not reveal his plans the time isnt right he says i do admit that i will keep on working on films and writing books and perhaps music an album music for films is ready for distribution and im working on a second but hooks and films are my most effective media my net film will he differenta french subject i dont want to risk being stereotyped as the director of negro pictures that next film the maid of all works will he adopted from a chapter of his novel the chinatnan of the th van peebles attitude toward the american industry that first rejected him but now barks kudos in his direction is summediip by his commentary on the san francisco festival in which he was one of three selected to he honored as a new director his film was the onlv one shown twice at the festival and most of the critics regarded it as the best liked i back in paris at a banquet given in his honor by la cinematheque musee de france a part of the french ministry of culture he remarked now everyone is trying to climb on the bandwagon but cinematheque was my original fan club i am working in paris where i am best known he adds how long ill he here whether or not i like living here and whether or not i am happy doesnt enter my mind i never waste time thinking about things i cant turn into something like a play a hook a film or a song im not unhappy because i am doing what want to do and my wants are simple this is a voluntary society nobody had i a gun on them nobody forced them to join so wliat are they complaining about the insistent question comes from a white member of a predominantly white chicago church he is tonguelashing what to him is a show of ingratitude by black fellow members who have set up a black caucus andaudacitv of audacitiesbarred whites from weekly meetings on the churchs premises some of the blacks have been integrated into the church since but now they are getting themselves together and doing their thing along with fellow black unitarianuniversalists across the country they are revolting against racism both within their denomination and in the nation the uniuni uprising is part of a larger eruption of black folks who like ancient jonah are challenging refuge in the body of a whale rejecting white paternalism they insist on selfdetermination this had been the mood of the meredith marchers two years ago then the mood of ghetto rebels and campus militants now black folks swallowed up in white churches methodists lutherans united presbyterians episcopalians mcrican baptists united church of christers and roman catholicsburn with what historian incent harding calls the religion of black_power some wear african daishikis and love beads some wear their hair in its happy state some challenge a white middle class christ whose name once graced the sides of slave ships some want to return home to the soulsatisfying fervor of the spirituals and gospels most are being born again in the process of challenging the old order most are revolting against that negation of blackness which moves some negroes in the scottishoriented presbyterian church to roll their rs as they speak with a scxttish brogue and pray for the scottish ideal of study in edinburgh most are disillusioned with church integration and generally agree that the sure way they can justify membership in white churches is to relate themselves and these churches to their suffering bottomofthebarrel brothers in the black community like black rebels elsewhere in america those in white churches articulate their longstanding discontent with an integration that has been an elegant form of shuckin and jivin a subtle putdown of black religiosity requiring blacks to join white churches but never urging whites to join black churches tlius they find white churchmen like the rest of white society only willing to accept integration on terms they dictate terms guaranteeing secondclass churchmanship for black men black folks can attend some white churches on sunday morning but not join in all phases of church life or they are not welcome as members or if they are members they are not selected for leadership positions in the church or if they are selected no matter how many academic degrees they hold they must be superised by white men they cannot as a rule become ministers in white churches and so it is that the ministry is one of the most segregated professions in america and so it is as harlem folk singer len chandler says caustically that the brass shines through the white folks golden rule much of the highly touted church desegregation of the s s and s had been merely a loose flirtation of allblack dominations with white protestant bodies at best it was whites and blacks getting together smiling roleplaying not speaking of mutually felt hate suppressing real feelings failing to make real changes at worst black folks were jim crowed into allblack subdivisions within the total denomination like the methodist churchs central jurisdiction the years of pious pronouncements on brotherhood from white churchmen the promises of a nonsegregated church in a nonsegregated society the pledges of commitment to the black communityall had been exercises in playacting and lip service for racism and the caste system had always been the th commandment of white christianity historically churches in the nations slaveholding sections had approved slavery many of those in the north had not after the civil war southern churches supported segregation as the will of god and rushed to segregate themselves northern churches did not then when the north grew tired of conflict and began to acquiesce to segregation the churches followed suit today the masondixon line in church race relations still straddles the canadian border thus for example a recent university of california study indicates churchgoers throughout the nation are more prejudiced than nonchurchgoers so how does one deal with white christian racism revolt and retreat had been the response of th century blacks who were relegated to the crows nest of white christianity they simply withdrew and established their own churches the same choice confronts todays integrated blacks or they can continue their decadeslong charade in white churches or they can press for genuine uptight for real twoway takeineasiamwithmychittlinsandall integration meaning not just the juxtaposing of black and white bodies but for instance white appreciation of black christianity meaning an openoccupancy policy in pulpits instead of as in the united church of christ a game of musical chairs in which qualified black ministers are rotated among a limited number of allblack churches meaning churchschool programs in black history and culture and the preservation of a distinctly black expression of christian worship where feeling and emotion are not lost as in the highly rationalized middleclass white religion meaning a warm vibrant compassionate and enthusiastic liturgy instead of the religious rites described by methodist reformer the rev james m lawson as sterile empty orderliness meaning spirituals and gospels truly integrated with gregorian chants and bach chorales for as chicago lutheran pastor bobbin skyles explains it is impossible for tis as a group of people to he excited about a song such as du heiliger geist or du frommer gott or o gott sei dank they are beautiful songs and chorales but yon just cant lose yourself in those songs because we dont have that heritage of years we cant point toward scandinavian or germanic background and say that these things have come down to us from the greatest of antiquities so you see we have a problem here with the singing that is produced in our churches the songs of classical christianity cannot be sung by negroes and consequently they have no religious or psychological significance presersing a black imprint on christian culture is only part of the burgeoning black revolt in white churches to every thing there is a season and a time to every idurpose under heaven it was observed in ecclesiastes centuries ago today as the black community trembles on the brink of revolution integrated blacks are reassessing their connections with the brother in a position paper distinguished for its directness blacks methodists for church renewal have summed up attitudes shared by most black rebels in other white denominations we confess our failure to be reconciled with ourselves as black men we have too often denied our blackness hair texture skin color and other godgiven physical characteristics rather than embrace it in all its black beauty we confess that we have not always been relevant in service and ministry to our black brothers and in so doing tee have alienated ourselves from many of diem confess that we have not always been honest with ourselves and with our white brothers we have not encountered them with truth but often with deception we have not said in bold language and forceful action that yoi have used white power in and outside of the church to keep us in a subordinate jwsition we have failed to tell our white brothers like it is instead we have told our white brothers what we thought they would like to hear we confess that we have not become significantly involved in the black revolution because for the most part white men have defined it as bad for the other part we have been too comfortable in our little world and too pleased with our lot as secondclass citizens and secondclass members of the methodist cduirch we confess that we have accepted too long the philosophy of raciwi this has created a relationship in which white people have always defined the terms and in fact defined when and how black peojdc would exist we confess that we have accepted a false kind of integration in which all power remained in the hands of white men but at last the old myths of white superiority and black inferiority are yielding to black pride selfdevelopment selfawareness selfrespect selfdetermination and black solidarity the methodists declare we arc new menthe old man nigger is dead the hoy is now a man this has been the spirit of militants revolting in the other major integrated religious groups mostly since july when stokcly carmichael and willie ricks resurrected the term black_power from the th century during that month a national committee of negro churchmen ncxc organized in dallas to put pressure on the national council of churches and its prcdominantlywhite protestant denominations temporarily calling itself negro instead of black in deference to older members the new interdenominational group now numbering about k promised it would seek to increase the number of blacks in iolicymaking positions in white denominations and to bring the resources of vviite churches in urban ghettos in such a way as to enhance negro leadership later gathering solemnly at the statue of lihertv thev issued a black pow er statement and thus gave the new ideology a halo of theological respectahility but to some observers the ncnc conclave had been an ominous happening perhaps these black clergymen had organized to burn down white churches or perhaps they were seeking repeal of the bible or perhajs at the v ery least they had lost their minds in any case whenever more than ten blacks get together people get scary explains exnational council of crunches official mrs anna a iledgeman we organized and immediately some questions were asked of us arent you sgregatiug yourselves oh no we arc just rtgrouping to come hack are you separating no because we are all rtlated in ncncs black_power statement that was later to become a fullpage adv ertisement in the new york times and a chapter in the rev dr nathan wrights hooklength treatment of the subject the ministers saw no conflict between black_power and cdiristianity instead they cited the urgent need for a power redistribution in america especially economic power at the statue of crispus attacks in boston they announced their intention to establish a national economic development corporation to hack small businesses and stimulate construction of ghetto housing by black firms employing black builders and laborers the racial emphasis had been crucial heretofore black communities had gotten the housing hut the profits ended up in the pockets of white men from the seeds planted by ncnc sprouted ad hoc committees of troubled and disgruntled blacks in both the methodist church and the united church of christ black episcopalians accelerated their revolt by march with charges tliat their millionmember church blacks denied black clergy etpial employment opportunity there had been only token appointments of black priests and black laymen to diocesan national administrative and executive posts they charged since there had been only two black exccuti e secretaries no black man bad ex er headed one of the churchs departments trained and experienced blacks had been shunted aside while less qualified whites received on the job training een in the churchs joint urban board of the home department where the urban crisis looms like a threatening storm over the innercity there had been no blacks at all the racial discontent bubbling within individual denominations went ecumenical in september when more than k clergymen of the national council of churches of christ gathered in washington for a dialogue on urban tensions and promptly split into black and yliite caucuses the black caucus urged white churches to join in affirming the legitimacy of the black_power movement seek the guidance collaboration and support of black churches in formidating and implementing all church policies and programs and declare a threeyear moratorium on suburban new church development and make the funds from such work av ailable to pcoplcccntcrcd ministries in the black and white communities the white caucus said it was determined to transform white society and addd we are encouraged by the courage of the llack american brother who has shown that he will create a new black society in america therefore where it is possible vva will move together for the transformation of american society where it is not possible to work together at present we will work separately knowing at the time that our separate work with blacks and whites is our cor task and work together by early the black_power uprising in white churches had involved even the ultraconservative roman catholic church which lists only one solitary black bishop no black monsignors and only black priests among nearly u s clergy by way of introduction a caucus of five black priests meeting last april in detroit declared their church primarily a white racist institution serving as a handmaiden to white society the priests added the catholic church is rapidly dying in the black community and unless it is to remain an enclave speaking to itself it must begin to consult the black members of the church similar sentiments came out of a closeddoor caucus of caucuses called by the rev dr nathan wright at the university of chicago in may some black clergymen from all major denominations agreed that black churches should serve as rallying points for gaming black control over all programs affecting urban areas across the country in boston about three weeks later the black churclimen who say they represent of the american baptist churchs million members topped a list of demands with a call for the election of a black man as the churchs next president church officials explained that a white man had already been elected but added it is highly appropriate that a fully qualified black person be nominated and elected as president of the convention then in an apparent show of good faith the first vice president they nominated was mrs a a banks jr of detroit wife of one of the black churchmen as militant as are the american baptist blacks they do not match the united church of christs fiery rev albert b cleage jr easily the most radical figure among black rebels in white churches his detroit church is dominated by a huge painting of a black madonna holding a black baby jesus his parishioners often wear bright african robes and red fezzes or sport black nationalist tikis or cahber bullets on thongs around their necks we start with tlie basic premise that the jews were essentially black says rev cleage jesus was in a sense a very revolutionary nationalist as were his disciples and he was opposed to the established jewish leadership which was willing to go along with the oppression of rome wliite christians have known this all along but they wouldnt dare tell us in rev cleages application of this gospel to the black nationalist movement gentiles are white christians and the conventional negro churches are the jewish establishments which betrayed jesus by following christs militant example the minister hopes u s blacks will forge a new black nation free of white oppression this separation may not be the ideal he admits but black men have not created it therefore they must deal with the realities of the situation and not with what they would like it to be rev cleages radicalized christianity probably has attracted more black_power apostles to his church than any other christian institution nevertheless it is a minority view among black rebels in white churches similarly mainstream black rebels are in disagreement with older white hberals who suddenly find tliemselves somewhat superfluous and stunned by the eniption of the black_power mystique in their chmehes more resilient younger white churchmen however see it as a healthy change and concede that their function in the ghettos is to support from the wingswith money for example under pressure from their black caucuses some white denominations have begun to respond relevantly to the ghetto crisis in nine locationsfrom malden mass to the watts area of los angelesthe meriean baptist convention for nearly hvo years has provided million in houses and apartments for families too poor to pay the going rents or to buy homes with conventional financing since the onset of this pioneering effort the national council of churches of christ has been helping to write guidelines for its other member churches it has set aside per cent of its unrestricted capital about for investment in poorer communities in like fashion methodists have agreed to raise million during the next four years to upgrade shun life united presbyterians have eannarked up to million for investment in high risk low income housing and business ventures in the inner cities lutherans have set aside million episcopalians are weighing a proposal for million in annual expenditures in the ghetto and unitarianuniversalists who dominate the far left theologically in the american religious community though numbering only will give million during the next four years to a black affairs council set up to appraise and fund ghetto programs but the black challenge to white churches may cost much more and not just in dollars at stake is their very existence the real question says dr gayraud wilmore who heads the united presbyterians council on church and race is not whether these churches can become truly integrated on sunday but whether in the next to years these churches will have any meaningful contact with black people at all before the year according to one prediction blacks will constitute between and per cent of the total population in at least ten of the largest central cities and in about other important urban centers another prediction is that cities will have absolute black majorities by whatever statistic one cares to consult continues dr wilmore it is clear that we are witnessing today what can only be called the blackanization of the american cities in these blackening cities the white church is dead or dying and will undoubtedly disappear in the next years because it is powerless to arrest these trends at the very least dr wilmore thinks the american church cannot come through the current crisis as a releant institution without a radical change in its spiritual and physical relationship to black christians xer cent of whom are in five allblack denominations and about small churches and to the black community as a whole there are no real possibilities for mission in the black community joint or otherwise he believes until white churches deal with racism among their members until they desegregate every aspect of church lifebeginning at the decisionmaking level running through the mission agencies educational institutions and local churches and continuing to decisions about questions of qualifications training and new opjortunities of meaning and worth for black leadership such radical changes must continue to be inspired by blacks within white churches we are morally obligated to prevent the church from committing sjiritual suicide declares a group of united church of christ ministers we are morally obligated to confront ourselves and our white brothers with the requirements of our judeochristian faith we cannot and will not be equiv ocal with the ethical and moral principles involved m ost people have almost limitless options of movement they can lie sit roll mil walk crawl stand and any one of these comes so freely it is never thought of as something special to jimmy mcmillan a talented young black artist they arc something special jimmy has only two of these options he can either stand up or lie down because of a severely crippling case of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis he has not been able to sit down for six years this dread and uncommon disease struck jimmy at the age of six years and now years later it has left him all but totally paralyzed he cannot move except on crutches he is unable to bend or turn his head the only two limbs in which he still has movement are his left leg from the knee down which enables him to walk on crutches and his left arm from the elbow dow n which allows him to paint dr j sidney stillman director of the clinical research unit for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at bostons robert b brigham hospital says that jimmy has one of the most extreme fonns of the disease he has seen in his years as a specialist in arthritic diseases the disease he explains has left jimmys spine and hips completely fused he explains that jimmys spine had fused completely by the time he was years old and that this was followed by fusing of his hips at age dr stillman says that no more surgery is planned in the immediate future we decided it is a better strategy to allow jimmy to build his muscles and develop interests outside the hospital he explained through the years his activities have be come increasingly limited hospitals and pain have become permanent parts of his existence but jimmy has never let them destroy his detennination to achieve a meaningful life he says in a calm bostonaccented voice my favorite saying is that the guy who can improvise is the guy who will survive jimmy has done more than just survive he is well on his way to being a successful artist having always had a desire to paint he enrolled in the evening division of the boston fine arts museum school of art for two and one half years jimmy has gone to classes hvo nights a week i missed only one class this past winter and that was because the snow was just too deep he says proudly his yearold brother walter whom he fondly calls buddy drives him to school and picks him up after classes the brothers enjoy a very close relationship natural and easygoing buddy recalls when jimmy first started going to his classes i thought they wouldnt be worthwhile but now i see the happiness and confidence they give him plus the recognition of his talent i am all for them dr stillman also notices a difference in jimmy since he became involved in his art says the doctor the meeting of new people the recognition of his talent and other more subtle benefits have been tremendous for his morale says john bynoe manager of bostons professional and business mens club where of jimmys paintings are on exhibit when i saw jimmys work i had to give liim a showing this is an art experience for the entire familyand a spccial treat for anyone who wants to see for himself what raw courage will do j immys paintings have been exhibited at the hospital and at the professional and businessmens chib in boston they range from colorful abstracts to geometric designs to a muchadmired sketch of his yearold grandfather entitled sorrows gene ward director of admissions at the art school explains he has been most impressed by mcmillans resixjnsivcness and sensitivity to everything he sees many people have creative potential but they cant develop it jimmy has been able to develop his jimmys inability to sit down was once a stumbling block to his artistic pursuits but dr stillman and steve weinberg a doctoral candidate at the massachusetts institute of technology found a way to help after long hours of experimentation weinberg came up with an electric tilttable with the table mcmillan no longer must stay in one position until someone comes to put him in another without help he can paint from a standing position and rest when he tires he uses his bedroom as a studio but would like to move into a larger place where i can ha e a suitable studio situation i would then be able to do more work at home art of course is not jimmys only interest he enjoys music and listens to it to create a mood when he is painting some of his favorite performers are ramsey lewis nina simone and the late john coltrane most of his music is taped by himself his most ambitious project thus far has been the allday taping of the martin_luther_king jr funeral ceremonies constantly tampering with his tape recorder and television sets jimmy frequently has to call on his mother to do some of the physical work required says youthful mrs susie mcmillan jimmy does the thinking for this family i do the labor jimmy is an avid conversationalist who peppers his o n chicagos west side along roosevelt and madison charred gaps mar the endless rows of ghetto stores burnt timbers and scattered bricks litter empty spaces all that is left of more than whiteowned businesses chicago is not unique following the murder of dr martin_luther_king jr fiery riots tore apart dozens of cities in all of them angry residents raided white businesses while few negro proprietors suffered destruction today in the uneasy quiet on ghetto streets people wait to see what will happen what must happen most say is a new order in the inner cities rebellious ghetto residents and even responsible negro businessmen are calling for a strong black business force and they want it now but to start a business takes money and knowhow where will it come from too often banks refuse to invest in negroowned stores and private loan companies charge prohibitive interest rates deep in debt with no hope of bank cooperation one young businessman found that the federal government could give him his first good chance after william spraggins bought a cdiicago patent medicine company last winter he needed money in the worst way altlioiigh his business j e mcbracly and co had profitably manufactured medicines since no bank would give him a loan and he owed friends the funds they had lent him to buv the business several months ago he worried aloud i have to pay off my bills through sales my credit is shot to hell i dont have any money to investhell i dont even have enough credit to buy a car much less expand a business when my daughter asks for her allowance or my wife asks for money just have to tell them i dont have it a magic genie has not whisked away his problems but today the picture is considerably brighter for spraggins he looks forward to receiving a loan the money will come not from banks not from friends but from the small business administration an agency he hardly knew existedan agency spraggins says gratefully that is willing to take a chance on vou when everbodv else says no like spraggins other black businessmen may find the small business administration their last recourse but so far relatixely few negro proprietors have called on the agency lets look at what it does sba dispenses millions of dollars annually to help small businessmen through its offices in major cities during the first six months of this year it approved loans totalling while only per cent of this money went to negroes more is available and some black proprietors will find theyre now eligible to receie loans sba can offer money and management counseling to those who ask for it included among their many programs are disaster displaced business and equal opportunity loans a group of businessmen who want to finance small firms themselves may qualify for local development company loans and obtain up to for each small business thev will aid other entrepreneurs can go to an indirect subsidiary of sba a small business investment corporation to obtain loans regulated by sba an sbic may borrow from the agency but selects and finances applications on its own and can charge the maimum interest rate allowable under state law recently the negro monthly newspaper supplement tuesday magazine reportedly obtained from the first capital corporation of chicago an sbic of the first national bank of chicago regardless of how much money a negro small businessman may need he has probably experienced the handicaps described by the late martin_luther_king first he said the major white chain enterprises have systematically locked us off the market thus not allowing us the right to compete and grow second so often when we have discovered a product we have had to sell the copyright and in turn become workers for the company because the banks would not lend us monev sba plans to counter these factors in two ways by financing the growing negro manufacturer it hopes to expand job opportunities in the inner city and provide a market for smaller black producers by helping the very small businessman who hasnt been able to get off the ground it expects to establish stronger negro retail and wholesale stores on the local level such government assistance can have concrete effects for example it may help samuel berry already considered a prosperous businessman in chicago become a little more prosperous thirty years ago when berry arrived in chicago from south carolina he had only and a borrowed car to start his own paper distributing concern later even though berry had trouble getting money from banks he was able to expand his paper business and purchase several supermarkets but he still could not obtain insurance last fall thieves robbed him of the small business administration loaned berry to expand his chain of grocer stores and to hire and train hardcore unemployed persons in the black community when berry first established his paper company and later purchased a supermarket he was not able to get an sba loan today he says this sba loan is an example of new small business power and its ability to increase job opportunities unlike berry not every negro businessman owns a growing enterprise he may just be starting his business under txvo new economic opportunity loan programs designed to help minority or underprivileged businessmen sba can lend up to if a bank refuses to cooperate and the applicant feels that he has suffered discrimination in his efforts to start a business he can qualify under these programs consider the benefits sba can offer government loans pro ide money at low interest and giv e the borrower ample time to repay an underprivileged businessman docs not always have to provide collateral instead the agency looks for good character in the applicant but when a person applies for aid he must convince sba that he cannot obtain private financing that there is a market for his store and that he can manage the business no bank would consider mrs mary l redmond a good risk yet sba loaned her the money to start her store for ten years mrs redmond hadnt been able to bring home a salary the mother of six children one of whom is retarded she received welfare payments for her familys support and lived in chicagos depressing west side mrs redmond is proud she didnt want her children to live under the stigma of welfare for the rest of their lives once a kitchen assistant she dreamed of starting her own soul food restaurant and told sba why she thought she could succeed there is nothing in this neighborhood as far as a homecooking place is concernedespecially in the carryout line like i want to start she insisted there is no restaurant in the luea to offer teenagers good nutritious food and young working mothers sometimes like to pick up something at the end of the day kids just dont get enough to eat today i know what it is to take and prepare a meal for seven mouths my goal is to make good nutritious meals at prices the people around here can afford to pay sba came through for mrs redmond with to start her soul kitchen todav she is a storerestaurant owner and managernot just another mother on relief her small place is sparkling clean and she employs four people to cook and serve food some day she hopes to expand her business into soul food frozen dinner production and sell prepackaged dinners to grocery stores although she is thankful for being able to operate a business mrs redmond is a realist she did encounter difficulties with the agency sba refused her loan application twice she remembers they didnt like my idea at firstthe idea of establishing a soul food place sb didnt think there was a need for a soul restaurant in this neighborhood because im a woman with no husband to help they didnt think i could run it after waiting almost two years and olunteering to work in a hamburger restaurant without pay mrs redmond did get her money but she says ruefully after i went through all this red tape they still made me wait and after all this they still could have refused me like mrs redmond other applicants may have problems with the agency those who come armed with a complete financial statement will fare best when they go to sba this statement should include profit and loss figures merchandise tum over and market outlook sba advises many applicants to employ an accountant and a lawyer to help prepare their cases one sba official eplained many black businessmen could get loans much faster if they presented accurate and efficientlykept records to the agency that is why it is so important to hire an accountant to help with the bookkeeping even with good records the businessman should be prepared to wait at least days while the agency investigates his case michael jarad negro manufacturer and an sba illinois ad isory board member counsels most people cxme to sba and theyre desperate they need the money immediately if they would plan their financial needs so as to give themselves a few months leeway then they wouldnt feel this urgency explains sba chicago regional director thomas cause we give loans not grants we must insure that our applicants do not have outstanding debts that people are not going to defraud the government the extra time pays off both for us and the applicant because we check evervthing so carefully because of its red tape and slow bureaucratic investigation sba suffers from widespread distrust and criticism in the black community mrs bcmetta howell a program coordinator with the chicago economic development corp an sba branch which works closely with negro businesses reports black people feel that these delays are a form of discriminationespecially since whites seem to get their money much faster some people claim the agency conducts a different kind of investigation for negroes mrs redmond complains that sba neglected to offer her adice after she received her loan with this store she says there is no one to help me buy my kitchen machiner i bought a new refrigerator and it brokethere went worth of food sba has given me no guidelines they put my loan money in the bank and in order to get one dollar of it i have to make a fonnal requisition there is so much pressure to nmning a business i feel if sba would advise me more id be able to go ahead but i dont think they have any faith in me because im a negro when the businessman makes a loan application he may be required to attend a few free business courses held monthly at a local sba office further training is up to the individual the agency cosponsors courses with selected universities high schools and private business groups which in tum may charge tuition most offices have management assistance representatives who will counsel and help proprietors obtain contracts for their products on request sba will send out a counselor from score service corps of retired executives to work individually with any business although the agency makes these aids available to all businessmen regardless of whether or not they have applied for a loan for the most part it does not actively promote its counseling serices businessmen should approach sba if they need advice the chicago regional director vve cant give as much counseling as we would like we havent got enough loan officers to do that lie adds i know many black businessmen need helpbut should anybody be taken by the hand and led down the line i dont think so critics charge there is a more serious deficiency within sba than a shortage of personnel and an ahundanc e of red tape they say the agency sinks money into hopeless black businesses instead of searching out the more ambitious negro entrepreneur statistics tend to uphold this criticism sbas delinquency failure of repayment rate for economic opportunity loansloans that most benefit the underprivileged negro businessmanis a whopping to per cent in comparison only per cent of loan recipients fail to repay under other programs to eugene and katherine alexander sba is a prejudiced organization a year ago the agency refused them a loan to expand tlieir parliament recording studio and electronic sound service shop in chicago why bitterly they charge sba wouldnt give us money because they knew we would make it they gave us the runaround we know several negroes who started grocery stores and they had no trouble getting money what happened to them they failed the whole theory behind sba is see were trying to help these people but theyre just not ready the alexanders do have business experience and they do have a market in their files they keep a stack of letters from customers who request their services they still need money to update their equipment they say we are the only negroes in this city who tape and press records but sba never even came out to see our store they never even had the courtesy to send us letters of refusal in los angeles aaron rothenberg supports the alexanders complaints president of his own franchise management consulting firm and an instructor of an sba cosponsored business course at ucla he says there is bigotry in the agencythey play god they try to help the poorest of the poor but ignore the pleas of the enterprising negro who has a good chance of making it they have no empathy with the black community and its needs i say why penalize the black businessman who shows greatest potential as an example he cites the case of two negro businessmen who applied for a loan both were his clients one operated a business and moonlighted on a night job to earn more than a year while the other could only make rothenberg says indignantly and who got the loan the ayear man a man who in my opinion hasnt got enough initiative to succeed in business the agency strongly counters these accusations retorts chicago regional director cause out of ten persons we interview we may encourage only two to applyand from these two only one man may get the loan we are highly selective we loan money only to businesses with the greatest potential i think these complaints charging prejudice or discrimination are ridiculous in addition sba reminds dissidents that it has been only four years since they created the equal opportunity programs to aid the negro proprietor says robert c moot national sba administrator for too long in the past the agencys programs did not reach the negro business community this was not intentional it was in my opinion simply a lack of understanding and perhaps a lack of communication now they face the demands and the militant mood of todays black businessmen the rev jesse jackson a disciple of the late martin_luther_king jr and national director of sclcs operation breadbasket says no longer will we allow the colonial powersthe white ownersto take profits and leave poverty to take joy and lea e sorrow to take our sense of dignity and leave only despair ultimately the black ghetto must be controlled by black people we shall find no peace until the reins of our destiny are gripped in our hands to effectively help the negro businessman experts say sba will have to open itself up to imaginative and creative thinking bernetta howell explains sba still runs by the textbook theory they have never had to confront a color tax added to the cost whenever a black man buys supplies or the overhigh rents or the raggedy buildings with their slum lords and their waterleaks and rats that destroy merchandise because of the background of black people weve got to have a chance and sb can help j cameron wade a negro business consultant adds if a businessman deviates from the mimeographed guidelines sba says no since most sba people are from the old line bureaucratic school they have a builtin resistance to imaginative thinking they will have to hold tiie hand of the negro businessman until he gets started despite criticism sba can still offer considerable aid to the individual black proprietor the agency realizes it has a long way to go before it can give all of the assistance needed says sbas new york area administrator charles kriger we know we cant clean up the situation today but were trying me adds the negro businessman has a right to expect expert government help especially help from sba loan officers of his own race the agency makes an effort to prov ide this recent efforts to improve the agencys contribution to black business include a program to advise and assist negro manufacturers and wholesale concerns in new york negro loan officers periodically visit these businesses to check their progress kriger says well help these manufacturers get contracts find space and get started were not waiting for the black businessman to come to us well go to him sba can help small concenis get government contracts even private contracts it will offer a ctttifieate of competency to allow a business to bid competitively if a proprietor would like to locate his store in a prime location or integrated neighborhood he will be interested in sbas lease guarantee program this plan prov ides rent insurance so that the tenant cannot default on his rent and the owner of the building takes no risk by leasing to him with these and other programs sba today looks forward to aiding more negro businesses perhaps the most enthusiastic evaluation of what this agency can offer the negro comes from spraggins the chicago patent medicine company owner lie says sba can save my life you dont appreciate this agency until you need itnow theyre trying to help me in every way the great value of sba is hope if had thought there was no hope for me i wouldve given up s ome liclv persons from across the country concninu in detroit this spring gave birth to the rcpiihlic of new africa the newest and perhaps hohlest innoxation in tlie liistory of black separatism the republic of new africa is no militant civil_rights group seeking equality with white americans but in the words of the conferees or deligates as they came to be called a black nationa government with its own elected olficials new african delegates signed a declaration of independence declaring black people of america forexer free and indepeikbnt of the jurisdiction of the united states incredible at first glance perhaps but the republic of nexv africa is in fact only the contemporary aspect of a vision that has long been endemic to americas racial realitv as far back as an attorney in fort smith ark s h scott attempted to encourage support for an allblack state and in a similar plan xvas undertaken in the oklahoma territory by edxvin p mccabe a onetime state auditor in kansas their efforts were short lived the largest separatist movement xvas of course organized by marcus garvey the legendary jamaican xvho founded the universal negro improvement assn in the early s back to africa xxas the theme and cry of garx ey and his folloxvers messenger elijah muhammad of the muslims like his predccessor w d fard has for nearly years preached a gospel urging blacks to separate from whites hoxvever the muslims have yet to move toxvards establishing a black state or nation but such a move is not xvithout precedent some years ago a group of black intellectuals in chicago headed by oscar brown sr father of singeractor oscar broxxm jr noxx a prosperous real estate man initiated the national movement for the establishment of a th state at the time there xxere but united states the leaders of that earlier movement not unlike the separatist leaders of today xvere black men xvho had pursued the melting pot ideal and xvho finally grexv disillusioned xvith the integration movement as a vehicle that xvould secure freedom and dignity for people xvhose ancestors had been slaxcs in america voicing a perfect faith in the all men created equal doctrine of the constitution and a belief that xvhite americans encouraged by the courts xvould honor that doctrine integrationists have sought in the years since the signing of the emancipation proclamation to enter in every xvay the mainstream of american life oitiiv lost faith in their white eoiintryniens will to honor their own principits and rtcognize tlie riuhts of black men as they would their own separatists have souiht to invest in the hands of black men the political economic and indeed the spiritual destiny of black people llacial conflict in this conntn not being without a curious satirical edge the vast majority of whites have disdained either movement vvheiuver it gained momentum the national movemint for the kstallishmeiit of a th state which never made headway outside chicago died within three years like a lot ol good ideas it failed because of a lack of funds reminisces brown we just coiddnt communicate thi idea well enough bv this time the late s the carveyites had become celllike and negligible in influence for the remainder of the decade the fires of separatism burned mostly as a product of black invoktment in the cjoiiiimuiist bartv w orld var ii breathed new life into the integration mov ement and not bfore the coming of malcolm_x would the scparntists again borrow the momentum that for some two decades was unquestionably the property of the iutegrationists it was a period marked by wartime employment postwar growth of the black middleclass korea the supreme court decision outlavving segregation in public schools freedom rides sitins boycotts a period in which the hope of black people rose to a new high as the present decade unfolded howxvcr it was discov ered that actual progress had in no way kept pace with the lromise that had been the source of that hope notwithstanding that in the first half of the decade the national conscience was aroiksed by an extraordinarv black writer and a remarkable black statesman james baldwin and the late martin_luther_king the life situation of the masses of black people took no positive turn unemployment remained a plague deteriorated bousing became more aged schools remained mostly segregated and additional classroom space in black communities lagged behind the birth rate and the income gap between white and black continued to spread traditional white attitudes pervaded the atmosphere under an alltooobvious euphemism white backlash the black community in the jargon of the day was uptight hope gave way to despairand despair has ahvays been the weight that tips the black freedom stniggle scale in favor of the separatists argument they argue simply that white america will remain intransigent and it is an argument claiming greater attention and wider support today than at any time since the garvey movementtlic current shift in momentum from integration to separatism which in no way suggests that the majority of afroamericans are separatists for as in any social action the ordinary citizen is not direcily engaged receives clarity not as is often assumed by noting the resurgence of the black_power theme in rather it is more useful to observe the events including especially those of the year that created an atmosphere in which the black_power theme and now the vision of separatism would meet with such unique reception the south starting with the kingled montgomery bus boycott in became the major battleground of the integration movement as it mov ed into the we shall overcome years with the activation of black students launched with the greensboro n c sitins in february and the founding of the student nonviolent coordinating committee during the same year the campaignor civil_rights movementgrew both in scope and intensity never before in the th century had the question of racism been brought to the attention of the american public so dramatically during this same period however another visiona vision that saw not black and white togetherwas being propagandized in the black community it was a vision with its own imagery blueeyed devils and its own ethics an eye for an eye and though less publicized than the dream of the integrationists it spoke more eloquently to the anguish of the nations black citizens the heartbeat of the separatist vision was concentrated in the north in a community where garveyism had been quieted but never truly died harlem and the voice giv ing eloquence to that vision was hat of a muslim minister of rare charisma the late malcolm_x the only revolution in which the goal is loving your enemy is the negro rev olution said the tall man who did not beheve black and white could live as one people in peace in this land its the only revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter a desegregated theater a desegregated park and a desegregated public toilet you can sit down next to white folkson the toilet thats no revolution revolution is based on land land is the basis of all independence land is the basis of freedom justice and equality and the man would cite the french revolution the russian revolution the chinese revolution and even the american revolution to support his thesis meanwhile in that troubled land below the masondixon line the young warriors for integration were enduring the wrath and barbarism of the white citizenry their klans their councils and their law enforcement agents each act of violence they suffered each atrocity against their fellows and the blacks they sought to assist for which man vvas made accountable to the law of the land made of those brave young who had gone south more intent listeners to the once abrasive sounding messenger in the north in the council of feilerated organizations a coalition of major civil_rights groups naacp sncc core sclc launched what was to become the most farreaching blackwhite confrontation america had seen since reconstruction the mississippi summer project organized around the issue of voting rights the project enlisted the fulltime involvement of hundreds of white students from the best of the countrys universities they along with the weary black veterans most of whom had left college to work in the movement journeyed to the land of the magnolia on the wings of the white involvement came reluctantly but finally the halfhearted support of the countrys liberal establishment it was a summer spent persuading mississippi blacks to defy local authorities and custom and sign up as members of the mississippi freedom democratic party it was also a summer of much violence including the brutal murder of three civil_rights workers james cheney andrew goodman and mickey schwemer and not a little friction between white and black idealists who hadnt transcended the racist fabric of the land tlie mississippi summer project reached its summit at the democratic national convention in atlantic city n j in august when the mississippi freedom democratic party presented documented evidence that black mississippians were systematically denied the right to v ote a request by the mfdp that the allwhite delegation from the state of mississippi be refused convention seats was repudiated the whites were seated the blacks were offered two symbolic seats with no vote as meaningless a display of tokenism as any to which black people have been subjected in their long north american witness earlier that same vear in march the differences between malcolm_x and elijah muhammad had culminated in malcolms departure from the nation of islam on june when national focus was on the students heading for mississippi malcolm announced the aims and objectives of his newly formed secular organization the organization of afroamerican unity oaau in july oaau chairman malcolm attended as an observer the organization of african unity oau conference in cairo egypt at the conferencc he submitted an appeal to the african heads of state asking that the united states government be brought before the united nations and charged with violating the human rifihts of million africanamericans journalist m s handler in a dispatch from washington d c to the new york times august wrote malcolms eightpage memorandum to the heads of state at the cairo conference requesting their support became available here only recently after studying it officials said that if malcolm succeeded in convincing just one african government to bring up the charge at the united nations the united states government would be faced with a touchy problem malcolms timing could not have been better his venture abroad vvhich in its identification with and appeal to what is called the third world gave a new dimension to the separatist movementcorresponded with the growing distress of black workers in the south who were tiring of both freedom songs and nonviolence and their distress was not due entirely to the recalcitrance of white southerners any workable integration between the races in america is necessarily dependent upon federal enforcement of black peoples rights and protection when those rights are violated federal protection for civil_rights workers in mississippi in as had been the case previously was at best tenuous this situation was prophesied in a conversation between john doar of the u s justice department and mississippi summer project director bob parrish moses in late june on the campus of a small ohio college moses was planning to send a group of male volunteers to the cities of natchez and mccomb in southwestern mississippi an area commonly known to be a ku klux klan stronghold doar pleaded with moses to refrain from sending anyone to that region moses refused to reconsider his decision theorizing that if he withheld workers from that area it would only serve to encourage the use of terror as a scare tactic by whites in other parts of the state doar looking sadly into moses eyes said in a soft voice if you send people down there theres nothing we can do to protect them in late a group of veterans in the stniggle for integration including then sncc chairman john lewis visited the african continent lewis and his party arrived in africa just after malcolm_x concluded a tour of african nations in a report to sncc dated december lewis vvtote among the first questions we were continually asked was vhats your organizations relationship with malcolms we ultimately found that this situation was not peculiar to ghana the country lewis and party first visited the pattern repeated itself in every country malcolms impact on africa was just fantastic in every country he was known and served as the main criteria for categorizing other afroamericans and their political views by years end it could not be doubted that the movement which started with the signing of the emancipation proclamation which realized its highest visibility during the period to had suffered a great loss in prestige the word integration was well on its way towards receiving a new connotation in the black community and with the assassination of malcolm_x february fully months before the slogan black_power was sounded on a mississippi highway the black separatist movement in america received prestige and indeed vitality that once belonged to the integrationists as author james baldwin had speculated regarding the student activity this movement i believe will proe to be the ery last attempt made by american negroes to achie e acceptance in the republic to force the country to honor its own ideals it was in the spirit of malcolm_x that black people came together to establish the republic of new frica the organizers of the convention were followers of malcolm who after his death founded a detroit based group called the malcolm_x society the new governments first vice president milton r henry and his younger brother richard r henry whose adopted african name is brother imari who serves as the republics minister of infonnation were the chief architects of the malcolm_x society and are the foremost ideologists in the new black nation milton a prominent attorney and former city councilman in pontiac mich was a personal friend of malcolms and accompanied him on his visit to africa brother imari who worked as a technical editor for the federal government for some years in detroit is the author of a hook war in america that pro ides the frame of reference in which the concept of the iuw go ernment is based black people according to the goernment of the republic of new africa have never had legal citizenship in the united states their premise being that the slaves when set free were given no choice with regard to becoming or not lecoming citizens the th and th amendments says the new government forced citizenship on black people and was therefore an illegal act by the united states goveniment moreover the republic of new africa notes that the th and th amendments protected the black mans rights only against the government itself they did notand do notprotect the black mans rights against other citizens therefore because the law which was supposed to grant freedom and citizenship to the slave did not guarantee his rights against other citizens the grant of freedom and citizenship never really was made however much their promulgation is made in the spirit of malcolm_x the concept of black people separating from white americans on the basis of an unrealized citizenship is much the same as that set forth by the national movement for the kstahlisliment of a th state in in their publication the th state compass editor brown wrote the constitution of the united states says all persons born the futility of appealing to the good will of whites as pointed out by modern day separatists milton henry hap brown minister of defense for the republic of new africa stokely carmichael and others was stated in much the same fashion by th state movement leaders writing in the compass bindley c cynis now president of victory mutual life insurance co in chicago asserted that the attitude of the white majority towards black people would not be changed by calling down maledictions upon the heads of the dominant majority invoking the sacred clauses of the declaration of independence and the united states constitution delivering lectures threatening those who violate these documents with eternal damnation continued cyrus white folk know the contents and import of the constitution better than the negro does they conceived the thoughts and wrote the words they know its meaning and significance but they adopt an attitude clearly contrary to their own commitments the fact of the matter is that while the white people need to be educated with respect to negroes the latter need to be educated about themsehes what is needed is not merely booklearning they now need an education in courage to face the cold stark facts of reality to examine and analyze those facts to place upon them the values which they merit and work out a program in terms of those values if education and literacy ph d degrees and scholarship keys blind negroes to seeing and dealing with these facts then an education means next to nothing to us the most significant fact in the entire program and the one which transcends all others is the attitude of the nonnegro population toward the negro the words of black rebels are at once as old and as new as the racism blacks have endured but time has finally caught up with the idea of separatism for those who seek it says oscar brown sr it isnt laughed at anymore he obser es brown bcliexes that the black masses have always been without real leadership at an age when most americans are retiring his mind remains unusually crisp and in tune with the mood of the young what negroes ha e endured in this land has residted in a strength that should produce a superior culture strength is often gained through struggle the negro has felt generally that lie wants to do good but hes icious when you keep pushing him instead of a guaranteed annual wage to sit down people should be paid to produce says brown he believes in the potential and capacity of the poor and suggests that the present generation of poor disfranchised blacks made unproductive by white racism and automation would have the opportunity to develop in a separate state we have so much to build on asserts brown we know the meaning of kindness because weve sought kindness we have a real sense of brotherhood and humanity the one significant difference between the brownled movement of the mids and the republic of new africa is that the former sought to establish a state that would still be governed by the us government brother imari a softspoken man explains why a separate state under u s rule is no longer sufficient we cannot exist side by side with white america with her huge military unless she changes therefore we will have to depend upon internationalism for protection but so long as we remain citizens of the united states of america no foreign government will come to our aid or even introduce our case to the un the republic of new africa has petitioned the u s government for land and reparations reparations wrote imari in war in america have never been paid to black people for the admitted wrongs of slavery or since slavery inflicted upon our ancestors with the sanction of tlie united states constitution the principle of reparations for national wrongs as for personal wrongs is well established in international law the west german government for instance has paid million in equipment and credits in reparations to israel for wrongs committed by the nazis against the jews of europe demands for reparations funnelled through a united black_power congress must include not only the demand for money and goods such as macliinery factories and laboratories but a demand for land and the land we want is the land where we are mississippi population black louisiana alabama georgia and south carolina the new government says imari does not anticipate that the united states will grant the land requested until weve proven we have the power to take it towards that end the republics officials at a recent meeting in dar es salaam tanzania with their exiled president robert f williams author of negroes with guns announced plans to recruit a combatready black legion tlie new nation plans to establish later this year a temporary capital in the state of mississippi we are going in with the objective of protecting ourselves says imari but we envision that upon opening our first office we will be assaulted by uniformed police the lawful authorities of the area the republic of new africa plans moreover to conduct a ote in black communities throughout the nation on the question of separation we expect to receive at least three million otes in favor of separation says imari through that plebiscite we will say to the un here are our people and invite the un to establish a legal base for our position in accordance with international law then if we are attacked we will call on the un for defense imari concedes that this new daring program of black nationalism was not whispered whole into anyones ear by malcolm_x but brother malcolm he adds in the last is months of his life became gods surest prophet to this lost black tribe in america milton henry former integration acti ist believes that at this point in history black people must separate in e ery way says henry i have a dream that one day we will control our own lives unfortunately i was born here in the united states but ive come to believe that we have a destiny greater than anything the white man has ever thought of his is a sentiment which finds epression presently in blacks of all ages and varying classes and even among blacks who think the idea of separatism foolish or not feasible that such plans have been set in motion is understandable for no matter what erdict history shall render the action of the day is but the fulfillment of the prophecy of web dubois who in wtote in the soullife of the land he is today and naturally wull long remain unthought of half forgotten and yet wdien he does come to think and will and do for himselfand let no man dream that day will never comethen the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning but words and thoughts he has been taught to lisp in his racechildhood a t a time when most broadway and offbroadway plawriglits are turning out lavish musicals or freakout fantasies many black playwrights tire realistically dealing with the experiences of black peolie in what the kemer commission labels a racist society one of the most talented black playwrights is ed bullins who recently bugged many refined theatergoers with a marquee inviting them to see his three short plays entitled the electronic nigger and others the productions name caused such an uproar during its offbroadway run that it had to be retitlcd ed bullins plays many people had hesitated to come to the theater because they were put off by the rather unusual title bullins candidly admits he switched rather than foughtfor financial reasons but audiences soon learned that the threepart production called the electronic nigger and others by any other name would play as well the first offering the electronic nigger is a cutting satire on the kind of negro who with monotonous regularity and pompous pretensions parrots the current whiteestablishment line on everything the main character is a student in a creative writing class conducted by a totally ineffectual young black instructor who lacking knowledge of fromerican culture is no match for his robotlike student bullins says his electronic nigger is a black man who has fully accepted white values and has become a gross distortion of what a black man should be bullins feels this familiar figure of the black community is very dangerous because he is what white people call a nigger but he will help them keep tabs on his own people by letting them train him in wiretapping and other snooping methods a second ignette is claras ole man a noholdsbarred sockittoem portrayal of life among black tenement dwellers in a south philadelphia slum a young man obviously out of place drops by to visit clara in her small apartment thinking they will be alone but he is surprised by the presence of big girl a crude harddrinking giant of a woman baby girl her spastic sister and later on by three young robber friends of big girls who are seeking sanctuary in claras apartment they all drink and carouse with big girl getting more and more belligerent toward jack the young man the climax comes when big girl spurred on by drink and jealousy screams to jack that she is the or man who clara told him would be working when he came around the language is raw and liberally sprinkled with nittygritty street terms the third play a son come home is a somber depiction of a young mans visit home after a prolonged absence he finds that his mother as a protection against hurts from the world around her has retreated into a fanatical fundamentalist religion when the son finally leaves after the frustrating visit it is tragically apparent that they will nev er understand each other again bullins three plays were well received by new york critics one praised him for giving his attention to the impact of one character on another the blood of drama not its gristle bullins writes for a black audience his plays are not long sermons to and about whitey in all three works the interaction is between black and blackthe son with his mother the teacher with his student the young man with the lesbian and three hoods whites have mainly a psychological presence in the plays bullins explains most of my plays are about black people who have been crushed by the system turned into gross distortions of what they can and should be because they were denied knowledge of themselves and a space to grow i dont deal with white society and culture because despise what it has done and still attempts to do to us a cultural nationalist bullins regards black cidture as the strongest and most positive cultural force in america this is most noticeable he says in the music field where the influence of black gospel jazz and rhythm blues is pervasive he feels that leroi jones the most significant figure in american theater today will lead black artists who will make black theater the dominant force in its field bullins stresses the black theater must be established as an institution in all black urban communities because the theater will reinforce black consciousness by exposing the lies that white culture has foisted upon us he continues the growth of black theater signals the end of our domination by white cultural values a domination which has kept us in psychological and spiritual bondage bullins calls the rise of black theater as a cultural concept a parallel to the rise of black_power as a political concept and adds the artist and politician should be working toward the same thing bullins scoffs at those who sav that black communities wont support theater they wont support just any theater he explains they want black and relevant theater thats what i hope to offer them to he relevant he savs black theater must transmit black revolution for revolution is the metaphor of the times and black people especially artists are the most vital people of our time with disconcerting matteroffactness he predicts eventually there will be attempts to destroy black artists just as anyone black is destroyed who raises the black consciousness level of his people right now bullins is playwrightiiiresidencc at harlems new lafayette theater whose building was recently burned dowm he was born in philadelphia years ago and got his career started as the cultural director for a community experiment in san francisco called black house he remembers that it was there while working with the author eldridge cleaver and others that he learned the importance of black theater the project fell apart because of conflicts between the artists and the politicians who resented ns he left san francisco and came to new york two years ago where a friend introduced his plays to the american place theater the theater decided to produce them but bullins yearns for the day black people will financially support black artists he feels it is contradictory to have a black revolutionary theater financed by the ford field and rockefeller foundations among others which is currently the case with the new lafayette theater bullins charges that the position of the black artist in america is perilous of his own critical successes he obsercs everyone knows that only one black playwright or actor is allowed to emerge at a time so now that they are all dowm on leroi i have been chosen as the next playwright to he discussed at all the proper cocktail parties he emphatically rejects this role he even went so far as to skip a ceremony at which he was to receive the vernon rice ward gien annually by new york drama critics to the plavtight who has contributed most to offbroadway theater bullins says there is only one reason a black playwright should enter the on or offbroadway arenato bring closer the day when urban black communities can and will support their own theater looking toward this goal bullins tries to make a special appeal in his drama to the to age bracket in this way he explains black artists can develop the audience which will insure our future m otor city baseball hopes over the past few years have lepcndcd upon the survival of a limping left fielder who is forever dodging high inside fastballs occasionally leaving the field on a stretcher and in between those events performing the awesome feat of blasting a baseball and even feet early in willie hortons first full season as a major leaguer detroit sportswriter joe falls jested that willie who was playing with minor ailments would probably play even if his leg was broken it hasnt come to that yet but later that season as the young slugger recalls it he was sliding in a game against the minnesota twins when he felt something snaj in his left foot since that time he has been playing more or less on one foot despite the pain horton finished the season widi homers in games and in limping through games he hit a respectable round trippers at the end of the season a bone spur was removed from hortons heel the tigers hopes for a healthy horton were however shortlived in a spring training game the following april the foot gave in and willie collapsed while running to first base the season opened with the man who was the only american league player to knock in more than runs in each of the two previous seasons not in the lineup it is not difficult to believe that the tigers who finished one game behind the red sox last year would have led the pack had not hortons lame foot caused him to miss games dropping his rbi and home run production to lows of and respectively this past winter horton endured another operationan inflamed growth was removed from his heeland once again the team hoped that the precision of a surgeons knife would leave them world series bound the tigers paced by hortons batting average homers and rbi were six games in front of the league as detroit fans flipped the calendar pages to august with their collective mind on october but horton was still limping and pain pills were still as much a part of his equipment as baseball spikes but if willie survives the season its a good bet that the tigers will wind up second to nobody and that their onefooted power machine will have bit homers and again reached the century mark in runsbattedin w illiam wattison horton says that he has fiin playing baseball and injuries have in no way altered his playing style a style thats best summed up in the comment of batting coach wally moses he come to beat ya this fella a throwback to the days when ballplayers took to the diamond with the allornothing attitude of gladiators entering a colosseum in ancient rome willie insists that guys who dont love the game cant play their best and in an age of moneyoriented athletes horton is somewhat anachronistic if i worried about the money i wouldnt be able to play he says and he adds in a mild voice that fails to hide a rather biting contempt for the bargaining tactics of modern day athletes i just dont go for all that sending contracts back when i get a contract i sign it his negotiations with management his salary is estimated to be are handled by his friend and advisor damon keith a federal judge keith as well negotiated hortons purchase of a home on a treelined avenue in northwest detroit and for horton it has been a journey further than any he dreamed of as a kid growing up in a housing project a few blocks from tiger stadium in detroit i did a lot of thinking last winter while i was in the hospital about where i came from confides horton he says that he will neer forget what it w as like to grow up poor and black in the citys slums and adds that such a background enabled him to understand the upheavals that occurred during the summer of in detroit like a lot of privileged detroiters he has set aside spare time this summer to work with youth the people had plenty reason to protest every man wants respect and dignity if you dont get respect out in the world you dont get it at home but horton thinks that tlie upheaval ceased to be effective as protest because the people took things they just didnt ha e to take things he laments and he apparently sees not a social paradox in that action by poor blacks and the fact that in his den he has a set of neverused golf clubs a stereo set and other itemsall of which he received as gifts because he is so long as he can hit a baseball an extraordinar negro willie hopes to play ball for another ten years and anticipates opening a little business when his playing days are over borrowing the title of fellow big leaguer frank robinsons book he says baseball is my life but he has no dreams of remaining in the swrt as a coach or manager like other black players in what sports illustrated described as the whitest of the white mans games horton carefully guards his opinions concerning racism in americas favorite pastime he voices the black athletes universal resentment over the systematic pairing of blacks as roommates in spring training and on road trips but without burning conviction conviction howe er is seldom absent in his play in a night game against the orioles in july horton wound up writhing in pain after attempting a diving catch of a short fly off the bat of brooks robinson doctors said that horton who was carried from the field on a stretcher would be sidelined for a few days but when the tigers took the field the next afternoon their left fielder was none other than number willie hortoneven though he had suffered torn abdominal muscles in the seventh inning with two men on and the trailing tigers threatening to rally baltimore pitcher gene brabenders fastball caught willie on the arm detroit fans sighed at the familiar sight of horton doubled up in pain i have to hit the dirt in almost e ery game says the man who is as strong as anyone in baseball there wasnt much action in left field that day as though the gods at least had mercy on one mans battered body w hen the aw lags beliiiicl the needs of society we can expect some ugly consequences and in the area of consumer protection the eils of allowing legalized thievery to flourish arc nowhere more strikingly evident than among the poor especially the minority groups in the ghettos the exploitation of these people by unscrupulous local merchants and flybynight operators is one of the silent shames of our coiintrv from coast to coast mainly in our urban areas those who can least afford to pay are paying unconscionable prices for junk pawned off on them through trickery deceit and fraud by signing contracts containing the most inhumane clauses these poor people legally bind themselves into misery and when they cannot pay or refuse to pay they find themselves pushed even further into destitution by a legal system which is incomprehensible to them and which has become perverted from a device for protecting the innocent to a means of abetting the dishonest in broad perspective many of the abuses inflicted on the poor especially in regard to installment contracts are used to exploit the middle class as well as the poor but it is in the povertystricken areas where the people are least able to get good credit and are the most vulnerable to the persuasions of the prevaricators that the ugliest manifestations are found the plight of the povertystricken consumer is all the more poignant when it is realized that his pursuit of goods and credit which in turn makes him so vulnerable to callous exploitation is in reahty what has been called compensatory consumption a desire to iufuse his existence with dignity denied him elsewhere by accumulating material goods thus to satisfy deep human needs the poor are drien into what david caplovitz a sociology professor at columbia university and author of the poor pay more a classic study of the problems of the poor iu new york city has described as a commercial jungle in which exploitation and fraud are the norm rather than the exception it has been well documented by professor caplo itz and others that the poor who can least afford to have their earning power diminished by high prices pay dearly for merchandise available much cheaper to the middle class the poor are at the mercy of highpriced neighborhood stores and doortodoor salesmen professor caplovitz found that in new york city those with family incomes of under consistently paid more for appliances than those earning over for example per cent of the lower income group paid more than for a table model television only per cent of the higher income group paid such a high price similarly per cent of those with the under income paid more than for a washing machine only per cent of those earning over paid a comparable price a comparative shopping study made by the mobilization for youth in new york city showed that an admiral inch screen portable television set cost from to cash on the lower east side an identical set was sold in a major downtown discount house for tliree women shoppers in the same survey also demonstrated how costly the color of your skin can be they each priced the same television set in a lower last side store the pioted price to a young white law sludtmit was to a puerto rican housewife and to a negro housewife a racial price dilferential of percent shopping siu n cys in boston philadelphia chicago and san francisco rcncal the same pattern the poor are paying exorbitant prices usuall to per cent more for goods from stores in lowincome areas as compared with those in ethical stores patronized by the middle class with pathetic regularity the merchandise bouglit by the poor is shoddy and they are deceived into buying it professor caplovitz reports the frustration of a middleaged negro mother on welfare who unknowingly responded to a bait ad promising the reupholstery of a couch for i phoned them and they sent ont a salesman asked him to show me the material lie pulled out some patterns and looked at them and said these arent so hot really want to gie customers something theyll be satisfied with then he hipped to the higherpriced patterns but i didnt know they were higher priced then picked out a pattern and asked him how much lie told me but i onlv had in cash and wanted to pa only in cash so i told him tliat this was too high he praised the matrial so much talking about its quality and durability that finally told him that if covdd get an account id take it lie gave me a contract i just took a quick look and signed it they sent for the couch and returned it two weeks later the work on the seams of the pillows was awful six moiiths later the wire in the springs popped out the side countless poor people are deceived into buying secondhand merchandise believing it to be new an elderly lady in washington d c rather wistfully tells bow she was tricked into buying a inch used television for by signing a receipt in response to a radiospot commercial that ironically began empire furniture and appliance company has sold thousands of television sets to people just like you because empire gies you a t deal thats unbeatable the woman called and asked for the companys free home demonstrationno obligation when the t was deli ered she said i told the driver the set was dirty but he said it was only dust and can be wiped off i paid him and he gave me a receipt he rushed out very fast and i do not liave good light in my room so it was not before daytime next day that i noticed i got an old set and not a new set as ordered i never knowingly signed a contract and ne er receiv ed a copy of a contract i only meant to have signed on the clipboard of the delivery man that i received the set i am not so good in reading and writing and i do not understand words and meanings which are in a sales contract i would never hae signed a contract of any kind without my son or daughter present to read it for me yet this poor elderly woman had without her knowledge signed a contract agreeing to pay in monthly payments for the old set an appliance store in maryland according to reports consistently sells repossessed teleision sets for as high as after paying only to for them a prospective customer enticed by advertising such as nodownpayment hae in your home tonvhtt enters the store and is disappointed to find only rows of beatup old sets the salesman assures him however that the adertised new sets havent come in yet but that by signing a contract ordering a new set he can take one of the old sets home to use in the meantime what the customer actually signs is a conditional sales contract purchasing the old repossessed set at an exorbitant price the new sets of course never arrive tlie contract is sold to a finance company and according to law the purchaser must make his payments washington d c like other major cities has a mercantile row i which caters to lowincome groups here in this areaseventh street in the district of columbiaone merchant does a thriving business in watches rings radios television sets eyeglasses and small appliances by selling the prestige of having credit salesmen are dispatched onto the sidewalk to detain passersby and entice them into the store by offering them a free gift and a credit card one elderly man told how he was approached by a sales clerk who said would you like to come in and get this gift he was handed two cards one read free gift for you no obligation dont buy a thing dont spend a minute just present this card and get your free gift the other read certifies that bearer is an aaa preferred customer instant credit no money down make your own terms this card certifies that you have a preferred credit rating and attests to your character excellence well you dont know what kind of gift it is until you go inside for curiosity said the man so he did and was disappointed to discover he was given only a ballpoint pen but bewildered by the attention and flattered by the offer of credit he had never been given credit at any store he did not want to pass it up he was talked into opening an account by signing a conditional sales contract for a watch his confusion over the purchase he was kind of scared because i never had an account before i got this account is typical of the lack of sophistication of such lowincome consumers week in a government cafeteria paid for a cheap watch worth onetenth that much and paid it off at a week this store attaches price tags to its merchandise but what customers dont know is that this amount hardly represents the items true value percent of the price is markup the store sells transistor radios for which the store buys wholesale at each toasters are marked up from to and sets of aluminum cookware from to in all cases at least a percent markup for the easy credit the eyeglasses scheme another shoddy practice of this seventh street merchant according to several reports is to offer free eye examinations obviously designed to sell extrax agantly priced glasses even to those who dont need them the store sends out a mailing inviting people in for a free eye examinaton no obligation a sign in the store also announces have your eyes examined free doctor in the house several people have sworn that after the examination although they insisted they didnt want the glasses the lenses were quickly inserted into frames and handed to them before thev could leave the store when thev refused to buy them they were intimidated into signing sales contracts for the glasses with you have to buy them we made them esptcially to fit you we cant sell them to anyone else when one woman so treated complained to a clerk that her vision through one of the lenses was blurry the clerk replied youll get used to it although a pair of glasses was advertised at a discount of from complete glasses often sold for and more than twice what other optometrists in washington charge a negro mother of five children said she was lured into the store by a direct mailing piece my eyes werent bothering me she said but i wanted to be on the safe side i was given a rain scarf as my free gift and was introduced to a man in a white coat who was called doctor this man examined my eyes and told me i needed glasses he said that sunlight would cause me to have eye strain and that i needed sunglasses additionally he said i needed glasses for n ading i had both pairs of glasses made up for me and i signed a contract to pay for them at per pair plus carrying charges of the prev ailing retail price for such glasses was her glasses were practically zero prescription rx cyl the weakest prescription possible next to plain glass and an optometrist who rctcstcd her vision confirmed that although wearing the glasses would not be harmful it was quite dubious that she needed them at all this negro woman works at a drugstore as a countergirl and is the sole support of herself and five children she earns ever two weeks yet monthly percent of this hare subsistence income is diverted from the necessities of food and clothing to pay for the unnecessary glasses thusand this is a fact too often ignoredsuch practices not only eiloit poverty they actually create poverty after witnessing the hardships caused by this one store alone an investigating attorney for the ftc wrote the business methods are so incredible and effect such fraud and deception on that element of the consuming public that he regularly deals with that it is almost impossible to describe them perhaps the most striking revelation to me after reviewing the ftc poverty cases was how skillfully these unscrupulous salesmen prey on the fears and insecurities of the poor and how susceptible the poor are to such blandishments and threats decidedly those who specialize in selling to the poor are astute students of the psychological and sociological implications of what it means to be impoverished in todays alhucnt society these socalled businessmen shamelessly exploit the poor mans desire for credit his longing for respect his fear of losing his job his homewhat little security he has built upand most of all his fear of being doomed to eternal poverty in one of the most vicious rackets im sure has ever been worked anywhere a company in the district of columbia in under the guise of operating an urban renewal project frightened countless ghetto residents into signing contracts for aluminum fronts for their houses at prices as high as and tlie salesmen implied that if they did not urbanrenew they would be urbauremoved many salesmenboth in stores and doortodoorcontemptuously intersperse their sales pitches with mister and insist just call me by my first name one homeimprovement company working the negro ghettos in washington d c pointedly used allwhite work crews whom the company representative in the presence of the negro homeowner always referred to as boys in fact the success of this particular scheme depended almost entirely on the salesmans skill at faking solicitude insidiously calculated to throw the victim off guard it was a referral scheme and the product was an intercom system consisting of an amfm radio master panel six remote speakers a fire detection and panic alarm system the company promised to pay for each fifteen names submitted and a prize for each sale made as a result since the financing risk was highmany of the people attracted to the scheme were not working or were on welfare and signed up in the desperate hope of making moneythe intercom cximpany sought security for the debt namely a lien on the purchasers property knowing however that the customers would balk at signing away such rightsafter all they didnt think they were buying something they thought the company was paying themthe salesmen engaged in an ingenious bit of chicanery after tlie customer had signed the participation plan conditional sales contract and the intercom system wxis installed a man posing as the company attorney or public relations man casually dropped by the house and made solicitous inquiries about whether the work had been properly done he carried a checklist which he meticulously filled in asking whether the workmen were neat and courteous whether the customer was genuinely pleased and so on almost as an afterthought he said oh yes i nearly forgot the salesman was in such a hurry that he brought you the wrong form to sign the first time he wrote void in large print across the original contract and asked now please sign these new papers just a formality disarmed by such unusual deferential treatment many customers trustingly signed without reading the second document which apparently wxis also folded over to conceal its contents what they unknowingly signed was a promissory note and deed of trust on their house a widow who got fooled it is shameful to sec these shabby homes paint peeling front porches crumbling inhabited by the elderly and infirm and yet replete with an elaborate intercom system that cost more than and was worth approximately but worse still is the feeling of desperation that besets these people when they cannot make payments and are threatened w ith the loss of their homes a widow in her seventies wrote to the vashinon star in may when i sent them instead of so i could buy some food with the the man called saying if i didnt send him the he would take out a lien on my house which i didnt know he had please help me i am an elderly lady a widow who got fooled so many persons in the district of columbia have been tricked into signing deeds of trust to their homes as security for swindles that the check and fraud squad of the d c police department has had one investigator exclusively assigned to tliis problem for two years the man assigned to that detail detective sergeant austin a moyer reports that the victims are nearly always negroes of little education and the tract noting the price as at the same time says mr gallman the salesman instructed her to sign something else which turned out to be a judgment note putting up their possessions as security and containing the confession of judgment provision soon afterward the gallmans received notice from a local company the midpenn discount corporation that they owed not but that figure which apparently included in finance chargesor percent of the actual debtwas filled in on the judgment note after she signed it mrs gallman maintains the tactics here are common says max weiner educational director for cepa he explains that salesmen trick people into signing notes for outrageous amounts sometimes several times what they think they are paying on the contract it says for example you have bought something for you sign it at the same time they present you with a blank judgment note the salesman says sign this too you have just signed a contract for so you assume the note is for the same amount sometimes customers are told they are merely signing an order for the merchandise the salesman takes back the signed note and fills in whatever amounts he wantswell not whatever he wants for there are laws on the maximum amount of finance charges allowed but he fills it in for the maximum figure which in this case was without the customers consent or knowledge the quiet people the gallmans reahzed they had been swindled but they didnt complain being quiet people says weiner they went along making the payments of per month which were to run for months about two years later mr gallman suffered an attack of asthma and was out of work the gallmans droppetl four months behind on their payments after gallman recovered they stniggled to make up the payments and during the next year and a half they paid faithfully every month and even doubledup twice on payments making them only two months delinquent or behind at this point the finance company had collected of the payments of the total the gallmans had only more to go on that illgotten unconscionably high debt when on may the finance company decided it was time to close in for the old delinquent payment of such timing is not always accidental attorneys for the poor across the country report that many companies wait until the debtor has substantially reduced his debt before taking legal action that way the company is a doublewinner it has nearly all the money owed on the contract and the mans property as well it is true that the finance company must return any money from the sale that is in excess of the debt but the property is hardly ever sold for what it is worth in numerous cases the company itself or its dummy bidders arrange to purchase the goods at a disgracefully low price they of course then resell it at a higher jjrice the attorney for the midpenn discount corporation demanded a writ of execution on the gallmans judgment note and the sheriffs office as demanded by law put the gallmans property up for public auction if the debtor resists the sheriffs office is required to seize the possessions by force thus on may two sheriffs deputies and eight poheemen smashed the glass in the front door and broke into the home of mr and mrs gallman with the intent of confiscating the furniture mrs gallman described as a frail elderly negro lady became hysterical and attempted to ward off the men with a barbecue fork it was later claimed by a deputy sheriff that mr gallman tried to defend his property by unsteadily waving an old rusty shotgun but the law was not to be deterred mrs gallman bleeding from a scuffle was tiiken to the hospital mr gallman was overcome by the policemen and not long afterward a truck came and emptied the house all of their furniture accumulated during thirtyfive years of marriage and valued at was put on the auction block it was bought by the vicepresident of midpenn discount corporation the finance company that had ordered the auction for the pathetic sum of three months later mrs gallman was still hobbling around with her foot in a cast the neighbors and a local dealer had donated some old furniture on which the gallmans sit mostly in silence just waiting for although stripped to neardestitution and living off the charity of their friends these poor people have still not seen an end to the bewildering workings of the law both marie and john gallman were charged with assaulting a policeman cepa has been criticized by certain finance companies for bringing pressure through picketing to achieve their ends instead of going through proper legal channels two automobile companies have been able to obtain court injunctions to stop picketing of their car lots however a philadelphia judge in lifting one of the injunctions said he could see nothing wrong in using economic pressure outside the courts it is almost a necessity he indicated for otherwise tlie consumer is powerless decidedly in numerous cases cepas picketing has shamed merchants and finance companies into stopping sheriffs sales however and this is a sad commentary on the state of our protective lawswhen such extraneous pressure has been unsuccessful or nonexistent countless persons in philadelphia have lost their homes after being deceived into enormous debt one man had his house sold by a bank after he missed only one payment an elderly couple lost their home in a sheriffs sale after they had been tricked into signing a lien on their house as security for a used automobile purchased by their son he was charged for a threeyearold chevrolet others have been driven onto the street their homes legally stolen and sold at auction because they were duped into subscribing to a foodfreezer plan or buying home firealarm systems on a phony referral basis a cepa official estimates that in philadelphia county alone between and homes are put up for sheriffs sale every month at least half of the forsale homes he says are to satisfy consumer debts many of them incurred through swindles for anyone who would like a brutal testimonial to the daily realities of the marketplace problems of the poor i would recommend cepas monthly tabloid newspaper consumer voice there is a certain impact and unforgetableness in seeing photographs of the victims and their children carrying signs losing our home due to misrepresentations and viewing reproductions of the actual contracts and dunning letters received by the poor one illustration that stands out as shocking is a collection letter from one of the largest banks in philadelphia it was dropped through the mail slot of a couple who had fallen behind in payments of a loan for the man and wife had reduced the debt to when they received the following notice scrawled in scratchy black capital letters on one of the banks envelopes we guess you want the pig treatment and we know how to treat pigs we will tell everybody that you are not worthy of trusti the american conscience the indignities terror violence despair and helplessness the poor suffer from deception in the marketplace should weigh heavily on the conscience of america for the cases reported here are not uncommon such illtreatment of the poor by unscnipulous merchants follows a similar pattern throughout the country in atlanta in chicago in denver in oklahoma city in seattle in san francisco and even in rural areas running throughout this cacophony of deception is a recurring disturbing theme the complicity of the law either seeming or real in supporting fraudulent business practices while oppressing the poor and the innocent many of the poor dont understand the most elementary facts of economic life for eample the role of the finance company they dont realize that their contract has been sold to an impersonal third party against which they have no legal recourse in their simplistic thinking when the product goes bad or they disco er they have been clieated they refuse to continue payments thinking this wall achieve results instead such action only brings forth the w rath of that strange institution known as the finance company with its full backing of the law refusal to pay often results in a summons to appear in court to offer defense some poor especially the foreignborn dont even comprehend the summons because of their inability to decipher the legal language others never receive the sninmons at all because of a corrupt practice known as sewer service the summons officer instead of delivering the summons to a ghetto resident simply throws it in the sewer leaves it at an old address or otherwise disposes of it with the debtor none the wiser the debtors absence in court is automatically recorded as defaulta confession of guilt he has forfeited his right to defend himself and the legal machinery cranks up to enforce payment professor caplovitz found that percent of the court summonses in new york result in default judgment because of nonappearanee unaw are of what has happened in court the debtor is surprised and shocked when the law mon cs in a wage earner may get a check with a portion garnisheed he may be summarily fired without knowing wtiy an officer of the law may appear one evening at the door and begin carrying out his furniture quite often the law and the merchants or finance companies present an ugly though perfectly legal picture of collusion routinely in philadelphia for example a deputy sheriff is accompanied by a representative from the finance company wtien con ducting a sheriffs sale on household goods it is not difficult to imagine how the arrival of this twosome in a police car must look to negro ghettodwellers alrady suspicious of the white man and his law a los angeles example one of the worst cases of v ictimization through ignorance is that of a yearold woman seral years ago in los angeles who stood silent and helpless while a local radio shop owmer methodically took over her property mrs elsie phillips had taken a radio to be repaired believing it woidd cost but when she learned the bill was to be she dispatched her yearold son to retrieve the radio instead he bought a new radio at payments of per week and mrs phillips signed the sales contract when payments were not prompt the daler obtained a court judgment ordering return of the radio and in court costs and collection fees it was easy to return the radio but mrs phillips could not produce to satisfy this debt the dealer then forced sale of her house and lot at public auction as the only bidder the radio dealer himself bought the property for mrs phillips was allowed to stay on at a wxek rent a year was required before the deed to the house could be officially turned over to the radio shop owner and during those twelve montlis m rs phillips coidd have saved her home by paying the plus a marshals fee but no one had told her and by the time she found out the deed had been transferred and there was nothing to do she simply sat cm the porch of her dingy home reported time magazine and wept faced with similar threats against themselves or their property most middleclass persons would respond with ill get a lawyer persons in poverty especially minority groups are so ignorant or leery of the law that they wont seek out legal aid and sometimcs wont even wholeheartedly cooperate when legal redress is offered to them neighborhood legal services a nationwide network of offices funded by the office of economic opportunity which handles cases for the indigent reports that their lawyers have great difficulty persuading their clients mainly members of minority groups to go to court even wiien their case is strong the poor cannot conceive of getting justice from a law which has so viciously exploited them in the past in an eloquent statement before the national conference on law and poverty held in washington d c in june nicholas de b katzenbach then attorney general of the united states summarized the feelings of the poor toward the law too often the poor man sees the law only as something which garnishees his salary which repossesses his refrigerator which evicts him from his house which cancels his welfare which binds him to usury or which deprives him of his liberty because he cannot afford bail the adversary system on which our courts are based fails whenever one side goes unrepresented and jiidgment is entered by default small wonder then that the poor man does not always respect law he has little reason to believe it is his guardian he has every reason to believe it is an instrument of the other society of the welloff of the well educated the well dressed and the well connected the poor man is cut off from this society and from the protection of its laws we make him a functional outlaw seldom in his stniggles with a finance company a merchant a landlord or a rigid official is the poor man even aware that he has rights which perhaps are being iolated if he knows he may have no way to protect them and finally even if he is aware of legal services he might well be deterred by irrational fear of cost shame or further exploitation fuel for riot fires wlien business and governmentin fact our whole enlightened societystrain to give equal employment opportunities to the negro we should also be farsighted enough to guarantee that his earnings are not stolen from him through unethical business practices and antiquated laws if we are not it should hardly surprise us that his resentment might provide one more bit of fuel for the riot fires who can forget the television and magazine news coxerage of youngsters in watts detroit newark some but ten years old smashing windows carrying off telcx ision sets and radios cursing the men who keep their jiarents in a perpetual state of intimidation misery and debt memorable are the words of one watts boy interviewed on television after the rioting he said looting and robbing is not the same thing whien you loot a credit store you are just taking back some of the interest they have been charging you for years on them highpriced installment things they sell you on time down and a week for weeks a number of witnesses called before the governors committee investigating the watts riot did testify that it was not mere coincidence that the prime targets of violence after the first burst of anger was unleashed were the establishments of merchants who engaged in sharp selling practices these witnesses saw a vengeance pattern to the destruction of stores in the curfew areas which they called a retribution on merchants who were guilty of consumer exploitation during the catastrophic detroit riots in june arsonists according to press reports systematically burned stores known to engage in sharp selling and credit practices thirtytwo furniture appliance and hardware stores and twentythree clothing and jewelry stores were destroyed reported a columnist for the detroit news a negro woman on relief set fire to a furniture store because she felt she would never be able to pay the bill she owed there due to the interest rate she was being forced to pay to satisfy an original debt of needed simple justice no one would be so myopic as to claim that exploitation by tlie outlaws of business is the sole cause of racial disturbances nor is an opposition to such ruthless exploitation based solely on the possible part it may play in fomenting riots simple justice and humanitarianism would demand an end to these practices even though the consequences were not so evident nor so serious as riots nevertheless it seems undeniable that the scandalous gouging of minority groups by dishonest merchants and salesmen contributes to a potentially explosive situation in every ghetto in america and is one of many discontents leading to riots this is a fact that has been too little recognized or explored as caryl warner a los angeles attorney who handles cases for the poor victimized by shady selling said right after the watts riots if that committee tlie governors commission to investigate the riots is interested in finding out some of the real causes of trouble they can come to this office and read a few of my files when historians write the story of all this trouble theyre going to wonder how in hell such an incendiary t llh afmasian inflttrncrs that have been creeping into mens fashions for the past two or three years will continue making headway again

chicago the proprietor a long time resident and a u s citizen and his counterman just barely off the boat from athens were smiling happily they displayed copies of the moniing papers and proudly pointed out that spiro t agnew had been picked as the candidate for vice president of the united states tliese men knew little about republican presidential candidate richard m nixon and even less about agnew they knew nothing about the platfoini nothing about the records of the two men they didnt know who the democrats were going to slate as presidential and vice presidential candidates but one thing they did knowmr agnew would get the full support of greeks throughout the country he is one of ours all greeks will vote for him said the jnoprietor maybe there are six million greeks in this country there are actually only va million thats a lot of votes a case of ethnic loyalty hile there is no way of knowing now whether all or most of the one million greek voters will support the nixonagnew ticket the two greeks mentioned above were following a longestablished election pattern in the nonmeltingpot of u s politics political parties have long taken the ethnic backgrounds of candidates into consideration and ethnic bloc voting has been greatly instrumental in electing italian mayors in newark n j irish gatholic mayors in new york and ghicago and white anglo saxon protestants in los angeles strangely it is only recently that this nations largest ethnic minority the negro american has begun to exercise the political power that lies in any large group with the bond of a common cause negroes in gleveland ohio and gar ind did join forces last year to elect negro mayors carl b stokes and richard s hatcher but throughout most of the rest of the nation there are countless examples of black candidates losing elections to whites even in wards districts and cities in which the majority of voters are negro some wards in chicago elected white aldermen last fall even though the wards are per cent black and the elected officials had only token residences in the wards in which they won office in many of the wards and districts where the contests last year were between two black men the winner was usually the negro most likely to follow the program of the white organization rather than the one who promised to put the rights and needs of his people above all else the shame of the nation here are more than million negroes in the united states and it is estimated that some seven million of them arc registered voters it is the shame of the nation that out of that tremendous number black people could send only seven representatives and one senator to washingtonand they couldnt even claim the senator for he got far more white than black votes when he was elected to office today more than million black americans have only eight representatives in the body which makes the laws of the nationmore than ii per cent of the population is represented by per cent of congress in only per cent of negroes of voting age even went to the polls in the presidential election per cent of the whites voted and this was during a period when equal rights for negroes was one of the most important issues before the nation the same old story his year marks another presidential election tlie two major issues are civil disorders a polite name for ghetto riots and the war in vietnam both issues are of prime concern to black americans who suffer disproportionately from both their neighborhoods are destroyed in one and their youth are sacrificed in the other the man who goes into the white house and the men who go to the house and the senate the men who are elected to be governors and other state officials the men who win mayoral and city council seats all will have a great bearing on how federal state and city goveniments react to recurring crises in many contests especially in the urban north the negro vote can detennine who these men will be with more than registered black voters in new york city nearly in chicago more than in philadelphia and nearly in detroit and los angeles the negro vote can be a powerful force in the outcome of national elections in the key states of new york illinois pennsylvania michigan and califoniia the negro vote can be a powerful force but will it will negroes not yet registered although of legal age put off registration until it is too late will registered negroes stay home because the weather is inclement will usually intelligent negro voters stay away from the polls because nobody is going to do anything for us anyhow will poor negroes sell their votes for a few dollars or a promise to be kept on welfare and will wealthier negroes sell theirs for promises of minor jobs and local recognition will it be the same old story of too little and too late or will the sleeping giant wake up and finally begin to assert his strength a unified front n recent years vast gatherings of negroes see opposite page on occasions such as the march on washington or the funeral of the late dr martin_luther_king jr have emphasized how many black people there are in this country but the biggest gathering of them all was just a drop in the bucket in comparison to the figure of more than seven million registered black voters if that seven million would show up at the polls this november it would have a greater effect upon the majority whites in this nation than all the civil_rights marches put together and if that seven million voted in unity that vote would shake the white power structure with more force than a watts newark chicago or detroit riot vote black vote bloc his year more than any other year the negro american should vote black and should vote bloc taking a leaf from the political histories of the irish the poles the italians and the wasps the black man should put aside his differences within the race and unite behind the men who will look selfishly at the black mans interests black leaders ranging from the integrationist urban middleclass to the ardent black separatists should get together to decide who will do the most for the black men a caucus of national leaders from stokely carmichael to roy wilkins should decide whom black people should support nationally state and city caucuses should be held to endorse the right man in state and local elections and once these candidates have been selected the negro voter should religiously support themeven though at times it would be against his personal judgment and the white man should have no reason to complain after all he has been doing this for centuries t he classic look is still with us and to many it provides a welcome diversion from the more exaggerated styles that have been holding the fashion spotlight so long everpopular are feminine dresses suitable for social outings and the office because these classic shapes emphasize the body in a subtle way theyre at their best when presented in soft fabrics

designs to order pattenis by mail just send money size and pattern number to simplicity patterns dept e madison ave new york n y prices are slightly higher in canada i n a way it seemed that history was repeating itself though the circumstances were somewhat different than tliey had been on a similar day five years past there was the public testimony of a mass march but the demonstrators of assorted hues and ethnic backgrounds could not compare in number or impact with the who once before had crowded the capital in peaceful protest their cause eradication of the common human blight of poerty was a broader one than the racial issue that had inspired a previous march on washington but fate had worked against them the national mood of guarded hope that had prevailed during those earlier years had been supplanted by bitterness anxiety and irresolution violence the spectre that had hovered so long at the edge of the collectiv e consciousness had become an actual presence in a stark drama enacted by defiant ghetto dwellers as well as silent assassins who claimed their victims from the ranks of the great and powerful violence had been carefully excluded from this solidarity day march but it had left an indelible signature on the poor peoples campaign it had deprived this show of its star and might well be ready to ring down the final curtain on his dream of a better america yet another had come forth to carry on for himnot seeking to take his place but modestly endeavoring to expound his message on the steps of the lincoln memorial where her husband had spelled out his famous dream in mrs martin_luther_king jr stood on a humid june day looking out over the frail plywood shacks of illfated resurrection city spread out before her were giant clusters of black white and red people searching so desperately for a last hope of sharing in affluent society to them her slain hiksband so recently a martyr had represented at least a slight glimmer of that hope long with their counterparts throughout the world they had recoiled in horror at the news of his death the preceding april her grief had been their grief but never could their pain be so great as that of coretta scott king a strikingly attractive and welleducated woman of years for though martin_luther_king jr might have been a public figure of immeasurable significance he had been first of all the man to whom she had devoted her life the father of the four children she must now raise without him this was a terrible burden but already she had begun to face it with a certain serenity during the days of fresh tragedy her strength of will and control under extreme stress had led many to refer to her as a black madonna tliroughout all the long hours of telev ision cov erage in the wake of his assassination and funeral she had not broken down nor vvept openly even those who had disagreed with her husbands tactics during his stormy but brilliant career had bowed in admiration of her quiet dignity her ability to endure the unendurable no one could deny the image of heroic black womanhood that she had projecteil now she stood before an expectant crowd of the undeqrivileged as hr husband had done before her calling for a new community of brotherhood and denouncing what she believed to be the triple evils of our timeracism poverty and war the ideological sources of her statements were quite apparent but the attention she commanded was rather a new thing for one who over the years had become accustomed to playing a siipportis e secondary role the problems of racism poverty and war can all be summarized with one word violence which seems to be fashionable in our society she said in a feminine yet forceful voice if we do not stop tliis madness we will certainly destroy ourselves and the whole world this was the sort of message one might have expected from her husband the nations leading exponent of nonviolence but coretta kings speech took on a slightly different tone as she implored others of her sex to draw upon their own resources of hidden strength in forming a solid block of woman power that might provide a creative approach to crucial problems she challenged them to join in a campaign of conscience saying women if the soul of this nation is to be saved believe that you must become its soul you must speak out against the evils of our time as you see them those of us women who have been blessed with the privilege of baring children have the sacred task of rearing them with a knowledge and understanding of our democratic heritage and the eternal values of love justice mercy and peace as women and mothers we have a common concern for the happiness of our children and their families to unite our efforts throughout the world she was definite about the objectives of this campaign pointing to the war in vietnam as the most cruel and evil war in the history of mankind adding if enough women spoke out against the vietnam war and stood firm in their opposition even to be willing to go to jail if necessary i think it would make a tremendous impact on the president and the policy makers of this nation so it was that in a time of personal tragedy coretta king emerged as a person of rare importance in her own right a leading peace adv ocate and supporter of woman power her appearance that day at the climaxing event of the poor peoples campaign was so impressive that new york times television reviewer jack gould was prompted to write the presence of a woman champion of equality for all races adhering tastefully to the views of her assassinated husband was something new and touching mrs king was easily the major figure of an occasion inevitably evoking remembrance of jiast national tragedies tliis was coretta kings most dramatic public appearance but it was not her first and promised to be far from her last all along she had championed her husbands cause but with less fanfare during dr_kings life she substituted for him as a speaker many times and on her own gave lectureconcerts throughout the countr to raise funds for the southern christian leadership conference which he headed her active interest in the international peace movement actually had preceded her hubsands for in she was one of delegates from the womens strike for peace to attend a nation disarmainnt conference in geneva switzerland she had always stood up to the challenge of being married to a controversial leader whose life might be snuffed out at any moment and in the first grim days following his murder in memphis tenn she went to that city to lead a march on behalf of striking garbage collectors in that w ay she fulfilled one of the commitments that death had prevented her husband from keeping her message that day was a poignant one rooted in his philosophy but its meaning was not new to her as a close friend confides she has been saying these same things all along but before not as many people were listening for coretta scott king is not an ordinary woman if she were she would not have been able to surv ive the very special kind of life she has had to lead even as a child in the small town of lleiberger ala about miles from selma coretta exhibited the exceptionally strong will tliat now has become her trademark one of three children born to the owner of a country store and his wife she was bright and very aggressive her younger brother obie l scott a methodist minister who still lives at home with his parents has recalled she always tried to excel in everything she did and she made good marks in later years coretta admitted herself that she had been somewhat of a tomboy in childhood prone to attack her brother or playmates she says i have always had a temper mother said i was the meanest girl i used to fight all the time though she sprmig from a family that had owned land in alabamas perry county since the civil war coretta had to struggle for everything she got and life was far from being easy especially during the depression when she helped supplement the family income by hoeing and picking cotton early in life she realized that others did not have to struggle as hard as she and that color had something to do with that difierence when she became a teenager it was increasingly more difficult to shut this racial awareness out of her mind particularly when she had to walk fiv e miles to a oneroom school while watching white children ride by in a bus yet she held to her burning desires to be treated as an equal and to do something for humanity however it was hard to even dream of acliieving such goals with limited financial means eventually she came to believe that education might be her salvation the magic life ingredient that would enable her to push beyond the isolated and restricted southern rural world she knew this observation became concrete in her mind when she entered lincoln school a private missionary institution in nearby marion there she came into contact with both black and white teachers these people who were college graduates impressed her more than any others she had ever met she was avved by their ability to discuss many diflerent subjects their enjoyment of books and music the way they seemed to get more out of life and she quickly noted they were treated with a great deal more respect than those who did not have an education coretta always had been an excellent student breezing tlirough the first six grades as the top student in her class at a country school her aptitude for learning was noticed by her teachers at lincoln and they encouraged her interest in music she had no idea that she would someday use her musical talent to achieve her quest for doing something for humanity it had been apparent all along that coretta was the sort of student who should go on to college and she was influenced in her decision by the example set by her sister edythe her senior by two years and now a school teacher in west chester pa in edythe had become the first fulltime negro student to live on campus at antioch college in yellow springs ohio therefore in coretta applied to antioch and was offered a scholarship by the schools race relations committee in an article she wrote for opportunity magazine in she admitted i came north with a good deal of doubt about the wisdom of doing so and with a good deal of fear that i wouldnt be able to fit into the very different environment but she knew that this move might enable her to achieve her goals the chance to better my condition to acquire prestige to earn my living antioch which already had acquired quite a reputation for its workstudy program but had not yet become the stronghold of liberalism it later became was a mixed experience for coretta as a token negro she was accepted to a certain extent but vvas not totally integrated into the social life that is supposed to make campus life a pleasure instead of a chore this situation had led edythe to abandon her pioneering stance at the school after two years and to transfer to ohio state univ ersity where negroes were less of a rarity but coretta decided to stick it out ignoring the little snubs and making enough friends that her occasional loneliness was bearable she chose a combined major of education and music pursuing her studies wliile gaining work experience by bussing and waiting tables at the schools dining halls serving as a counselor at karamu camp near cleveland and being employed at various times at a settlement house niirser school and library a practical sort she could see the value of antiochs cooperative training program and said of it it makes studies a lot more exciting if you can see how they fit into supporting yourself her only major trauma came when the time rolled around for her to fulfill her practice teaching assignment under ordinarv circumstances she would have been assigned to the public school system of yellow springs but since no negro had ever taught there her supervisor suggested that she teach instead in the antioch demonstration school the incident hurt coretta who said i could have done that in alabama i came up here to get away from that kind of thing but she resigned herself to her plight after carrying her fight to the highest school authorities it steeled her for tlie future and left her no illusions about northern integration corettas determination to go on in spite of all odds stemmed from her growing involvement with music singing was her first love and she hoped to enter a conservatory specializing in voice after getting her degree someday she hoped to build a career for herself on the concert stage but she realized that she should be prepared to do sometliing else if need be during her student days she wrote concert work is uncertain and whether or not i can secure recognition as a concert artist i shall be able to support myself and get satisfaction from my job shortly before graduation from antioch in june coretta submitted two applications that were to be most important to her future one was to the new england conservatory of music in boston mass and the other was a request for a fellowship from the jessie smith noyes fund she vvas accepted at the conservatory but several anxious weeks went by without word from the noyes foundation finally she left for boston with practically no money but armed with the determination to work at any job she could find until she had earned enough to pay her tuition fortunately she did receive the fellowship at the last minute but after her tuition was paid there was no money left for room and board more detennined than ever plucky coretta survived on graham crackers peanut butter and fruit a friend helped her find a room in a fashionable beacon hill home where she paid for her lodging and breakfast by cleaning the fifth floor three rooms and two stairways somehow she managed to make it tlirough that first hungry year in boston and later received the state aid which alabama provided for negroes barred from that states white institutions she also worked as a clerk in a mail order house while vigorously pursuing her vocal studies it was after coretta had been in boston for sev eral months that she first met the man who was to become the most important person in her life the future leader whose life was to become inextricably interwoven with hers mary povvell a voice student from atlanta insisted that coretta meet this young minister named martin_luther_king jr king it seems was a brilliant scholar from atlanta who had come to boston university as a graduate student in philosophy after completing his studies at crozer theological seminary with an outstanding record and a special fellowship as coretta later admitted she had no aspirations toward becoming a ministers vvdfe and was convinced that this king fellow was probably an older man pious narrowminded and not too welltrained like most of the preachers i had known around my marion ala home he was not the first time king called her after coretta had given permission for her telephone number to be passed along he handed her a line such as she had never heard ranging articulately through histor and philosophy on their first date when he drove up to meet her in his green chevrolet he studied her as carefully as she studied him she alreadv had decided that he was too short instead of love he discussed communism and capitalism and when she made an intelligent remark he brightly commented oh you can think too before he took her home on that first date he said to her youre everything im looking for in a wife in a series of articles presented some years ago in the new york post ted poston wrote extcnsively on kings unorthodox courtship and of corettas impressions of him she said the more i saw of him the more i liked him there was something about him that sort of grows on you and she recalled he talked so often about what he planned to do with his life of what he hoped to contribute to the race and to humanity at large in this respect their most basic goals bore a striking similarity as they became inseparable and the time drew near when he would ask her the big question coretta realized that she might have to choose between her love for him and her desire for a concert career then it was that she asked of herself two important questions do i love him enough to make any sacrifice and can i give him up and not miss him her answers yes to the first and no to the second question there was no longer any doubt in her mind as to how she felt about him and on june coretta scott became the wife of maitin luther king jr the ceremony was held in the garden of her parents home in alabama and the grooms father the prominent rev martin_luther_king sr of atlanta officiated the call to destiny came far sooner than either young martin or his wife might have imagined ev en if tliey had entertained some inkling of their phenomenal future after he had obtained his phd degree from boston univ ersity and coretta had graduated from the conservatory the couple settled down in montgomery ala where the new dr_king was to pastor the innuential dexter avenue baptist church the rest is a matter of history the boycott the jailings the petty criticism and public glorification a nobel prize and international acclaim the endless crusades and the ecpially endless suffering endured with an unshakable faith and finally the shattering climax of violent death always coretta was there to encourage him and to share his commitment even when she could not accompany him on his missions hers never could hav e been an ordinary marriage in any sense of the word and coretta soon was conditioned to face each nevv crisis with that same steel will and determination not to be broken in fact crisis was her constant companion and each of her four children was bom to her on or around a time when her husband was engaged in a particularly critical stage in his career avlien their oldest child yolanda denise now was only two and onehalf months old dr_king was taking his first big step toward national recognition by leading the montgomery bus boycott one night when the baby was asleep in her crib at the rear of the house segregationists hurled a bomb into the home with an almost deadly accuracy then an angry mob ringed the house armed with guns knives sticks and bottles it was dr_kings courage and finesse in handling that mob that enabled the family to survive and from that time on coretta knew that death might be the price they would have to pay for their cominitment shortly after that incident corettas father came from alabama to take her and the baby home to safety but she refused to leave insisting that she remain by her husbands side when their second child martin_luther_king iii now was only a year old a mentally deranged woman stabbed dr_king while he was autographing books in a new york department store a physician who attended him later reported that he was only a sneeze away from death and a close friend reveals that coretta feared that he would be dead before she arrived at the hospital after making the trip from atlanta to new york she had braced herself for death and was prepared to face it but that time he surxived when she was pregnant and about to deliver their third child sevenyearold dexter scott her hiusband was dragged from an atlanta jail where he was being held for conducting civil_rights demonstrations and taken to the notoriously rough reidsville state prison a phone call from the then sen john f kennedy comforted her and kennedy later was instnimental in having her husband released baby bunny fiveyearold bernice albcrtine was only three days old when her father was held incommunicado in a birmingham prison cell where he wrote his famous letter telling why we cant wait again kennedy by this time president came to the rescue and took a personal interest in the case it is no wonder that coretta king had to be also a special kind of mother raising four children whose father could spend so little time with them though the occasions were full warm and deeply shared by all in the family at times it was difficult for her to explain to them why their father had to go to jailcommonly regarded as punishment for wrongdoingso frequently and translating the absti actions of his cause into simple childs phrases like daddy goes to jail to help people somehow she made them understand this she did in addition to instilling in them a pride in their blackness though the bewildering reality of soutlierii discrimiuatiod reached out to touch them all of this was more than most women might have been able to bear but coretta was not content to play a completely passive role she never had lost her affinity for music and believed that her vocal training might be instrumental in her husbands work in she decided to make a series of public appearances singing some of the songs that were part of her repertoire and later presenting concerts of freedom songs laced with a commentary on the movement what it meant and why it was necessary to support it this did not always meet with the approval of dr_king who was concerned about the safety of his family and preferred that they remain out of the public spotlight but corettas steel will came into play and she had her way mrs xeniona clayton a teleision personality in atlanta ga where mrs king lives traveled with her close friend on many concert tours playing the piano for practice sessions handling press information and tending to any ihcessar business mrs clayton recalls that dr_king took pride in his wifes talent but only begrudgingly accepted her traveling for concerts once when she played to an audience of kk in san francisco he was said to remiuk jokingly fd better pull her off the road shes competing with me but what really con inced him of the value of her work was the fact that she was able to raise thousands of dollars for the southern christian leadership conference mrs clayton recalls one week when the sclc treasury was so low that dr_king feared he would be unable to meet the payroll t the last minute a check came in the mail x that mrs king had raised with one of her concerts it spoke louder than words occasionally corettas steel will cropped up in little domestic matters she was quite aware of her hirsbands greatness and made numerous phone calls trying to explain what he was doing when outsiders criticized him she seemed to want the world to recognize that he was as great as she knew he was often he was reluctant to be considered as anything other than a simple man this was most apparent on one occasion w hen a large portrait of the nobel laureate was given to his family mrs king immediately had it hung in the long entrance hall of their modest home in a simple black neighborhood in atlanta acarding to a friend dr_king protested saying youre not supposed to memorialize people while theyre still living the portrait was removed but in a few days it was returned to its spot on the hall wall and still remains there at home in those happier days she took charge of domestic matters though she had household help when her husband would bring home visitors on little or no notice she could always whip up a quick meal and be flexible enough to adjust her schedule as a devoted wafe she took particular care of her husband preparing his favorite dishes like homemade vegetable soup when he w as able to be w ith the family making it a point to get the special kind of shoes he liked and making certain buttons were sewed on and other wardrobe matters kept intact this is the side of her that was not knowm by the public that sometimes regarded her as a bit too poised and too reserv ed to be for real all this was quite a job carried out with efficiency and devotion but now the task has been multiplied a thousandfold now she must assume full responsibility for her children until dr_kings death it was not publicly known that his commitment was so deep that he had not set aside large sums of money for himself or his family besides the modest home his wife reportedly was left w ith only though she also w ill receive income from a x insurance policy taken out for her by singer harry belafonte a close friend on dr_kings life howxw er she stands to come into considerable riches for she has a contract with holt rinehart and winston a new york publishing house for a sum exceeding on her memoirs due to her publishing commitments neither mrs king nor members of her family are permitted to grant interviews with the press until the proposed book is published possibly at the end of this year she has gone into seclusion in new england to writc this book while the children are being cared for in atlanta under close supervision but she bears other new responsibilities too following her husbands death she was elected to the board of the southern cliristian leadership conference thoujih her involvement with that organization does not tend toward the fundamental business of procedures and programming there are many on the outside who believe that she might develop into the sort of charismatic figure around which sclc might inspire public support and dramatize the meaning of its mission however great pains have been taken to avoid any conflict between her and the rev ralph david abernathy dr_kings best friend and his successor as president of the sclc but it remains that coretta king has become a figure of national note and that she has every intention of carrying on her husbands work in whatever way she can hers is a fresh and compelling oice and other advocates of woman power are looking to her to lead a new coalition to work toward peace and social welfare for she knows too well what tragedy violence can bring it has been said that her eloquence rivals that of her late husband and she possesses a certain appeal for those of varying racial and age groups vhen she took her late husbands place as speaker for the senior day program at harvard university she drew a standing ovation with her comments on a pressing contemporary dilemma stating the generation gap is a nositive thing if it separates evil ideologies and customs of the past from the free spirit that animates much of the contemporary student moeinent the young understand this society better i than their elders think and better perhaps even than their elders thtniselves so coretta scott king the strongminded little girl from alabama has found her place in the sun though recognition has come about in an unlikely way and only by means of a price that is too high to calculate she too might make history but even if she does not she intends to live out the rest of her life in a spirit of dedication her motives were set forth clearly and simply in the speech she made at memphis when her face was still drawn in grief she spoke of her husband as a great man a great father and a great husband but then went on to carry his banner saying we are concerned about not only the negro poor but the poor all over america and all over the world every man deserves a right to a job or an income so that he can pursue liberty life and happiness our great nation as he often said has the resources but his question wasdo we have the w ill somehow hope in the hesiirrcction experience the will will be created that has a heart and mind and soul and spirit of those who have the power to make these changes come about if this can be done then i know that his death will be the redemptive force thit he so often talked about in terms of giving his life to a great cause and the things he believed in
